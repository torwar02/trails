‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,"Busy Place to Hike, Worth Doing Once",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Took an uber to the visitor center. The uber drivers have to pay $2 fee to get through the gate for the day, so I felt a little bad but the uber was $11+ from Waikiki. It was still early (around 9am) so he could make multiple trips up and make up for it."
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,All good except for parking,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family of 4 hiked diamond head, took us about 30 minutes to go up, 25 to go down, and It was amazing, one of the best hikes I’ve ever done. HOWEVER, the reason for only two stars is the parking problem! We drove our car all the way into the crater to the parking lot, but as we kept getting closer we noticed they were steering people away, and making them turn around. When we got to the near front of the line, we saw a sign saying “parking lot full”. Now, I understand it’s crowded and all, but they really should have put the sign up more (maybe by the cave tunnel you have to drive through) so people don’t have to  drive all the way there just to get turned around to leave at the entrance to the lot. What we did was park our car in a neighborhood and got a olive that dropped us off at the lot. They really need to get there parking situation under control. If all those cars were able to park (and therefore pay the parking fee) this monument could be making a whole lot more of money! So, I’d recommend  either making the sign that the lots full more visable and further up, or allowing people to park in the huge open dirt field right next to the parking lot!"
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,Great Challenge for Seniors,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our third climb so I had to rate it a little less than the first when it was a nivel experience. Having said that, I would consider it a must do if you are in Honolulu. Public tranportation is available and cheap. It was $2.00 for a city bus, but it does not get you real close to the crater. About a 15 min walk and it does get hot. There are trolleys that drop you off right at the visitor's centre but they are more expensive. We went by rental car and the fee was $5.00 for parking. No other charge. Since we are both seniors we took our time going up. Also my wife has a bad knee, but that should not deter most people. They say 20-30 min is a good time to reach the top. The ascent is fairly gentle with the stairways the hardest part. 99 and 76 steps. There is a long tunnel too, if you are claustrophobic at all. The view at the top is spectacular. We liked being able to see our hotel, the Royal Hawaiian. You really should go."
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,A must see,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing hike. They charge you a dollar to get in and then you follow the trail all the way up. It's a combination of ramps and stairs. I would suggest still wearing good shoes as there are some uneven paths at times. It's pretty busy as it's a popular hike but very much worth it for the views. They don't let anyone hike after 4.30pm so make sure you get there in time.
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,Excellent hike offering great views.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took a cab from Waikiki on the first Thursday of December.  The cost for Diamond Head was $5/person, but if you drive, they also charge $10 to park.  The park doesn't accept cash - only credit/debit card.  Hike to the summit took over 1/2 hour due to some parts being steep and taking photo breaks, etc.  When you go through the tunnel toward the top, you have to go either left or right - we went left because it's not quite as steep as going right and through the steps and spiral steps in the bunker.  We spent about 20 minutes at the top admiring the great views before we started our descent going through the bunker on the way down.  We arrived at 8:45 am so it wasn't too busy, but it started getting crowded before we left at about 10:30 after drinking a pineapple drink at the bottom.  We walked back to Waikiki (about 2.5 to 3 miles because we visited the Honolulu Zoo which is on the way back.  If you go, bring water, sunscreen and wear comfortable shoes.  I would describe the hike as moderate as it wasn't too difficult, but it helps to be in reasonably good shape."
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,Great way to watch the sunrise and take in the scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We came across this place when looking for things to do on a drive around the island. This is state monument, so you do have to reserve your slot ahead of time online. They open about a month or two ahead of time. It seemed that there was a lot of availability all the way up until a day or two before that it was filled up more. The morning times are more popular than the afternoon times. You do have to pay entry fee, and then if you are parking, that is an extra fee as well. I did see many people park elsewhere down the hill and then walk into the park, which I believe is a discounted entry fee. Once you scan your reservation, you get handed a map (helpful for the hike since there are some forks in the path) and you park and take the path to the top of the crater. There is a very very small shack with some limited souvenirs at the bottom in the parking lot as well. The path starts out paved for a small bit, and then it turns to rocky and uneven as it winds it way up to the top. There are also many stairs. Please be sure to bring a water bottle! The trail isn’t very wide so everyone was courteous in pulling to the side if they needed a break, or if someone else was going the opposite way that you were. There are a few spots as well that have some pull off areas that have benches or just have different scenic views for photos. We chose to do the sunrise hike so we arrived at 6am (they open at 5:45am) for the sun to rise at 6:30am. The temperature was perfect before the sun was coming up. Many other people had the same idea as us because it was quite crowded at the top and hard to find a spot to sit and watch the sunrise, many others spread out along the path on the way up. There is a bunker built into the side that there are some signs about at the top. At the top you can get a view of the crater below, a view out onto the ocean, a view of Waikiki, and a mountain/island view. It was a very cool adventure to do. If you are fit and don’t stop along the way, it will take about 30 minutes up and 30 minutes down. Overall this was a cool thing to do as we have never seen or been on a crater before, and it had amazing views. This was also a great way to catch the sunrise."
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,Diamond Head,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I would recommend either going very early in the morning or late in the afternoon . We visited about 9:30 am and it was very crowded and hot. The hike itself is not difficult, although it does involve a constant incline and steep stairs.  Views on top are beautiful."
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,To the top in 20 mins - Yes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This adventure was taken with a full on workout in mind;  I did it in flipflops and made it to the top of those many many many make shift stairs in 20 minutes.  The climb for the average person would probably seem grueling bothersome and not worth the trouble, but low and behold once you make it to the summit you are rewarded with the most fantastic views that will surely be one of the most lasting memories of your entire vacation!"
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,Tough hike but worth the views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were here in January and the rainy season came early.  We had a rental car for the day and first arrived in the morning but it was jam packed with cars; the wait for parking would have been long.  So we passed and went on our rest of the day tour of the island. Toward the end of the day, we decided to give this place another try; to our surprise, there was plenty of parking and they weren't even charging to park, but we would have to hurry before they closed. The hike was much harder than I expected; not so much for our energetic 18 year old grandson. He kept slowing down/waiting for us.  The view from the top does not include the actual Diamond Head crater, which was disappointing, but the views of the island were great.  With the rainy season comes the rainbows. On the way down, I slipped on a wet area but luckily was holding onto the rail and just wrenched my shoulder a little, but better than falling. Wear good quality shoes!  I was but still slipped in the steeper wet areas."
‪Diamond Head State Monument,4.5,Amazing views!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A must experience hike while in Honolulu! Omg! I cannot express how outstanding this hike was. Diamond Head is great for anyone who wants to experience nature at its finest. We did the early morning hike 6:30am so we could watch the sunrise and it was incredible!!! The hike itself was a moderate hike, but I recommend to get there as early as possible because it can get hot really fast. Take the essentials; water, sunblock, a hat and some really good shoes. "
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,"Too many visitors, no respect for place or people",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Probably my fault for going on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of a pandemic, but this place is a trash dump. 1 in maybe 50 people even bothered to wear masks on crowded trails. There’s litter everywhere. The bathrooms are the grossest I have ever seen. And everywhere, no matter where I went, there was some selfish jerk blasting music on a portable boom box. It seems like people are given free rein to treat the place like garbage and there aren’t any staff there to enforce the rules. Why don’t they charge even a small admission? If they did, maybe that would deter people from coming to hang out and trash the place. It might also pay for rangers on the trails so that people actually face consequences for disrespecting the site and other visitors. As it stands, it seems like the people of this state are perfectly happy treating one of their geological wonders like a trashy amusement park, and given that there are so few places like this within easy driving distance of Chicago, that's a real shame. It makes me wonder what other natural sites in this state have been ruined by mismanagement."
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,Do not go on a weekend,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went last weekend and I do not recommend going on a weekend until the Covid-19 crisis is over. Very crowded, no distancing- people seemed totally unaware that a global pandemic is happening. No wonder Illinois rates are rising. Even in public areas where masks are supposedly required, less than 1/2 of those in the buildings were masked and only about 10% of those hiking and you are literally right on top of another person much of the time"
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,Frozen wonderland ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This park is extremely popular.  I’d recommend weekdays or the winter. During the cold parts of the winter, the waterfalls freeze and provided spectacular images.  The trails are easy to manage.  The Illinois River is such a creative erosional force.  "
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,water falls and river,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There are many hiking trails along the Illinois River and in the many canyons.  The “water falls and river” make it that much more scenic.  There are a lot of unique chain saw art sculptures scattered around the lodge area.
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,Good hiking.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My first choice was Matthiessen down the road, but it is still closed due to storm damage, so I went to Starved Rock instead.  That really ins't a complaint.  I just wanted a more intimate location since I was by myself.  "
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,Beautiful views and great hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Took about 3 - 3.5 hours to hike from visitor's center down to LaSalle Canyon while hitting Starved Rock, French Canyon, Wildcat Canyon, LaSalle Canyon, Eagle Cliff Overlook, and Lover's Leap Overlook in that order.  French Canyon is pretty (sunlight glistened off the water onto the canyon walls) and most accessible but it also crowded for that reason.  The waterfall at Wildcat was a small trickle compared to the others but it's also very high which is cool.  LaSalle Canyon was definitely worth the hike especially since you can walk behind the waterfall for some cool photos."
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,Too Busy For Its Own Good,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We visited twice over a 5-day span in October 2020. Each time the park was VERY busy.
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,Covid alternative,5.0 of 5 bubbles,When you really need to get outside when everyone tells you need to stay in and social distance this is a great place to go.  The trails are marked well and it is a great way to spend a few hours outside.  There were not a lot of people there but everyone seemed to do their best to either have a mask on or social distance on the trails and on the stairs.  There are a lot of stairs to climb if you are on the trails so be prepared to walk and climb alot if you want to see the canyons and  river areas
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,"Lots of Trails, Waterfalls, and Canyons!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We cannot wait to come back in the Spring/Summer/Fall to go hiking.  We arrived just after a big snowfall, and although the lodge sells yak-traks for the adventure seekers so they can walk the snowpacked trails and even climb a frozen waterfall, I wasn't brave enough to attempt it, although I would have loved to watch someone climb a frozen waterfall.  The canyons and waterfalls look beautiful, and my husband walked one of the trails to get a look at the canyon.  Starved Rock Lodge has a short film that shows some of the trails, canyons, and waterfalls, and we will definitely come back to see them in-person!  We also highly recommend staying at the beautiful Starved Rock Lodge or at least enjoying a meal at their wonderful restaurant.  We did catch a glimpse of an eagle in a tree near the roadside because we were here while the eagles were migrating in the area."
Starved Rock State Park,4.5,Junior Ranger Program and MOSQUITOES!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'd recommend doing this park in the spring and fall early in the morning in the middle of the week. In the spring, you may catch the waterfalls. In the fall, you'd see more at the overlooks and/or get some color. The park has some interesting history and I'd recommend arriving just before the ranger tour. The visitor center opens at 9:00."
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,Dangerous bike path,1.0 of 5 bubbles,The bike path is a very dangerous bike path. Some bikes are going 30 mph or more.
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,Best of Burlington,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of the best bike paths I've ever been on.  Just amazing views and we had the perfect weather.  I will say if the weather isn't good you won't be able to enjoy it as much.  The path is well kept and if you're lucky enough to get the ferry, the team of workers are like a comedy routine.  They accept donations and worth it. Plenty of bathroom stops and places to sit and take in the view. We did 27.1 miles- it's not a loop so you can stop and turn around at any point. We started at hero island and went to Burlington then turned around.  Plenty of parking. We say people swimming and places to eat but we packed our own. We had mountain bikes and we saw others with hybrids and road bikes. It's a must do- plenty of people walking and running."
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,Great walk or bike ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Walked the bike trail but next time here will rent  an electric bike readily available with access at various locations. The walk is extremely enjoyable along Lake Champlain looking over the glass still waters and the beauty of the mountains. A park on one side can be had for lunch, walking your dog or eating and sitting on the large swings available throughout your bike ride or walk. Highly recommend the adventure!"
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,A Very Civilized Walk on Water,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked this on a warm sunny clear afternoon and boy was it worth it.  Made up of giant blocks of marble pulled from nearby quarries, this was a causeway for a now abandoned railway."
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,Riding Bikes on the Burlington Bike Path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great trip! We arrived at approximately 9:30 am and made our way to the entrance of the causeway. Earlier in the day, we rented two bikes from locomotion and transported the bikes via a bike rack to the causeway. The Burlington bike path was fantastic! I highly recommend this excursion for anyone visiting Vermont! The bike path was clean, nicely landscaped and the views were out of this world. The causeway was about 3 miles each way, with multiple places to stop along the way to rest and take pictures. The bike path was slightly crowded when we went, however everyone was super friendly and followed the rules on the road. "
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,Scenic Bike Path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a good, mostly flat bike path which runs along Lake Champlain. There is parking available in a number of spots and some scenic sections. It is very popular, however, and was crowded in some places especially as you near downtown Burlington. I would try next time not to ride at quite such a peak time to avoid crowds."
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,A Burlington Highlight,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Burlington bike path is only 10 miles long, but it is noteworthy for its spectacular Lake Champlain views, first as you ride along a waterfront park and then as you ride on a causeway that used to be a railroad three miles out into the Lake, which produces spectacular panoramic views that you'd otherwise need a boat to get.  About 2/3 of the trail is paved and the other 1/3 is tightly-packed gravel.  You could make it on a road bike, but the hybrid I rented was ideal.  The trail itself is mostly flat - I rode the entire trail using the middle 8 gears of the 24-speed bicycle."
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,Experience the feeling of being alive!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love walking the path! There are numerous places to sit on a rock or under a tree and watch the waterfowl come and go. All kinds of boats go past, fishermen and their families spend a great deal of time looking to catch the big one. The sky is big and open and you feel lucky to be alive!"
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,"Go as far as you can physically go, and then come back!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The bike path is OK until you reach the Colchester Causeway then it gets amazing.  There is nothing like riding, walking, or jogging in the middle of the lake.  The ferry should be open in mid August which wll allow you to travel to the island.  So much fun."
Burlington Bike Path,5.0,Wow. Fantastic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Such a pleasant ride, going North, or riding South. So pretty.  A friend who has ridden the USA rode it yesterday said- ‘it’s a jewel “.  So many places to stop, lock your bike, sit by the lake, or take a walk in the woods.”   She was completing a 509. mile journey to visit us, and that was her path on her final day, at age 77.  "
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,"Don’t hesitate, just book-it!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did the Broken Arrow tour and it did not disappoint. Our tour guide was Corry G. and he made our trip a blast. He was an excellent driver who was knowledgeable of the area we toured, and he kept us engaged. He was also very friendly, and comedic at times. I’m very impressed with Pink Jeep Tours, and the comradeship that the other Pink Jeep drivers displayed while out on the trails was amazing!"
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,I LOVE SEAT BELTS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I did go on this trail but we had a driver so it was the safer way to go. The road was definitely full of pot holes that made it a wild ride. The turns and unexpected vistas made the outing more interesting. The driver was great  and pointed out the various rock formations some of which were breathtaking. The trip lasted about 1 hour and I was looking forward to a soft seat.
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,Absolutely awesome view at Chicken Point,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is so popular because it is so stunning.  Put aside the Pink Jeeps and other 4x4 all terrain vehicles, this area is simply beautiful.  Especially around Chicken Point and Submarine Point.  Wear good hiking boots with great gripping soles.  Some areas can be slick."
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,Absolutely gorgeous hikes and final view! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a VERY nice hike! It was secluded and quite on the other side of mountain. We couldn’t hear any traffic or car noise. It’s an easy, straightforward hike, with great signage to follow. We went mid morning and the weather was perfect (some overcast and some sun). The views are beautiful in the canyon, we felt we were in small amount of forest. At the final point, chicken point, the view is stunning. It’s VERY windy there, so be sure to hold on to your hat. On our way out, we saw many, many bikers (apparently, it’s very popular). We liked the hike because it was quiet, secluded, non-commercialized, not so many people around! "
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,Don’t Be a Chicken..take Broken Arrow to Chicken Point,5.0 of 5 bubbles,While we have hiked several trails in Sedona...we decided to take Broken Arrow to Submarine Rock to Chicken Point and back to the trail head of Broken Arrow.  
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,Beautiful hike minus the jeeps,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a beautiful trail that covered different types of terrain. We started at Broken Arrow trailhead and included the submarine, chicken point, High on the Hog and Twin Buttes. We explored a little in the area of chicken point and ended up w about 5 miles total."
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,Best hike we did in Sedona,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best hike we did in the area. Around each corner we saw jaw dropping views. From the parking lot to chicken point was a nice hike. Mostly easy terrain. A few areas we a bit more challenging as we had to work our way up some rocks. By sure to take the small output to submarine rock. It was well worth the short detour. My only complaint would be the noise from the Jeep tours. They are very close to the trail in a few points and the noise detracts from the wonderful surroundings.
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"An option to Jeep tours is a hike that is not too difficult. The Broken Arrow trail is an easy hike, but you need to pay attention to which branch you hike. The parking lot is at the trail head, and there is no fee to park. If you take the left fork, you have to watch out for tour Jeeps and yo-yo's driving erratically, often blasting music, on Canams and other off-road vehicles. The right fork is for hikers and mountain bikers. For a bit more elevation, but not too difficult, suggest starting on The Broken Arrow Trail to the Twin Butte Trail, to the High on the Hog Trail, and then connecting back to the Broken Arrow Trail. Many photo opps. Trails are well marked with rock pylons encased in wire mesh. We did a Jeep tour earlier in the day to Mogollon Rim. That would have been a difficult hike, so Jeep tours are a good option as well."
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,Wow……I didn’t know a Pink Jeep could go over such rough terrain!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was the second time I have done the Broken Arrow Trail with Pink Jeep Tours.
Broken Arrow Trail,5.0,Easy hike great views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started at the trailhead to hike to chicken point overlook about 1.3mi hike. Very enjoyable, small elevation gain hiked out to submarine rock than up to chicken point overlook. Many trails here, plus the jeep tours come out that way. Chicken point overlook is the destination for this hike. Awesome views of the wilderness and canyon.   "
Anhinga Trail,4.5,Park is great! But beware of car theft!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The park is beautiful, and the trail is beautiful. This was our second visit. The first visit was full of wild life in the spring. This last visit a week ago had only a couple gators, which could be due to recent hurricanes."
Anhinga Trail,4.5,Amazing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Made a stop here on the way back to Miami to catch our flight home. So glad we stopped, this was one of the highlights of our trip to southern Florida! Saw 9 alligators right off the trail, lots of birds, fish, turtles, etc. Easy path and raised boardwalk. Restrooms available. It did cost $30 to enter the national park, but given the wildlife we saw, we felt it was worth it. Would highly recommended if you want to see alligators!"
Anhinga Trail,4.5,Fabulous Trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived early on a Wednesday morning, about 8:30 before the visitor center was open.  The gates are open 24 hours. We had a lovely hour or two meandering the trail and taking photos of alligators, herons, anhinga, ducks, egrets,  gar and other fish, and lots more. There were other people there, but it was not crowded at all and great for taking pictures."
Anhinga Trail,4.5,"Beautiful, but over 80% less wildlife than I saw in the past.  **IMPORTANT UPDATE**",4.0 of 5 bubbles,***IMPORTANT UPDATE***
Anhinga Trail,4.5,Boardwalk provides a different perspective on the Everglades,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had enjoyed the excellent Shark Valley Tram Tour a few years ago, and visited here to see what it offered.  Good timing let us take a ranger-led walk along this short boardwalk trail.  The first visit was so good, we came back with friends a week later."
Anhinga Trail,4.5,BRING BINOCULARS.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've read dozens of reviews that said this was THE trail to walk—that there were so many animals, it was almost Disneylike."
Anhinga Trail,4.5,January is a good time to visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved our walk on the Anhinga trail. We were lucky that a park ranger was out about halfway, answering questions and helping point out wildlife. She also let folks use her binoculars, so if you have your own, I'd recommend bringing some; they definitely help. Yes, beware of vultures. There are some tarps at the visitor center right by the trail you can borrow to cover your car, but they are limited. "
Anhinga Trail,4.5,Where are all the gators and birds?,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We have visited everglades natl park numerous times over the years.  There has always been an abundance of wildlife to see on the anhinga trail.   We went January 10 and 11 of this year and were disappointed by the lack of animals.  It would appear as though there had been some burning going on prior to our visit.  We saw only a few anhingas, a couple of gators.  In the past we would see a minimum of 20 gators and many more birds and fish.  Still a great spot, but I'm wondering where all the wildlife got to?"
Anhinga Trail,4.5,Anhinga Trail by day and night,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our first visit to the Anhinga Trail was on the Starlight Walk with Park Ranger Daniel. We had a great time exploring the park by starlight and flashlight. Daniel had great knowledge of the park and animals and lead a great tour. We saw a handful of alligators, tons of huge spiders (wear sneakers on this walk at night!), and a yellow Cuban tree frog.  There was a decent crowd the night we went but everyone was respectful and the only flashlight was the park rangers so that was nice. The stars were amazing! I highly recommend the starlight walk tour."
Anhinga Trail,4.5,Wildlife abounds!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Having spent a couple of hours on the Shark Valley tram the day before, we weren't sure we were willing to take the 45 minute stroll on the Anhinga Trail in the heat.  I am so glad that we did!  We saw so many birds and gators up close, much closer than we saw them in Shark Valley.  If you are going to do one thing in this area of the Everglades and are willing to take a short walk (all level trail), I would choose this over the Shark Valley tram tour."
Redwood National Park,5.0,Towering redwoods,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This national park, in conjunction with three redwood state parks, is a UNESCO World heritage site because it contains some of the tallest and oldest trees in the world. Thomas Kuchel is the Visitor Center for this park, and it remains open during Covid, although for limited hours. We hiked Trillium Falls Trail, which is a fairly easy trail with good traction, and walked through LBJ grove. The rest of our time was spent at Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park to the north, which has a more extensive system of hiking trails. There were no fees to enter, and both parks were quiet on week days."
Redwood National Park,5.0,Majestic and incredible,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There are so many beautiful and amazing things about this National Park and its surrounding State Parks. There is just something indescribable about standing underneath the massive redwoods.
Redwood National Park,5.0,Amazing National Park with the Tallest Trees and so much More,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It would be easy to simply think of Redwoods as a forest park, as we did hike in two groves with the tallest trees in the world but visiting it exposes that it is so much more.  It is meadows and mountains, creek valleys and shorelines.  It is unique wildlife like Roosevelt Elk and banana slugs as well as whales and sea lions.  It also is not just a National Park but 3 California State parks that protected groves 50 years before the NPS.  Finally it has incredible forest scenic drives but also amazing mountain overlooks.  "
Redwood National Park,5.0,Huge Beautiful Trees,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The huge trees of Redwood National Park really blew me away. Before coming here, I had an idea of what to expect, but I did not know how much I'd love being next to trees that are hundreds of feet old and hundreds of feet high. Redwood National Park is also located next to the Pacific Ocean so besides the trees, it also includes beaches. When we went in mid May, it was very rainy, cool and had a bit of fog too. "
Redwood National Park,5.0,Gorgeous!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Loved this park. What I always do when going to any national park is stop at the visitors center first. Tell the ranger how much time you have and what types of things you want to see and do and they will advise you on a plan of action. 
Redwood National Park,5.0,Awe-inspiring Nature,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Redwood Forest is so grand and magnificent it is hard not to be in awe. The trees alone are incredible, and the many trails and small info-stands all around the park make it a interesting and fun area to hike in. Definitely a place to go both with friends and family, no matter if you are a outdoorsy person or not. Truly a must see park!"
Redwood National Park,5.0,A FOREST OF MAJESTIC GIANTS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Some roads are intermittently closed, as are some viewpoints. I drove around and also walked a couple of the trails, spending about three hours here. Leashed dogs are allowed in some areas. Magnificent trees, many well over a thousand years old. There were other visitors but fewer than I expected. Walking around here was like being in another world. "
Redwood National Park,5.0,Redwoods and More!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What an amazing day we spent at Redwood National Park!  There is no way to adequately describe the beauty and splendor of this place.  We hiked through Lady Bird Johnson Grove in awe as we walked amongst these giant Coastal Redwoods.  Besides the trees, there were unusual bushes, lots of wildflowers and the occasional wildlife  - from our car, we were surprised to see a young black bear in the road, probably 300+ pounds, foraging for food. He was so surprised to see us that he froze long enough for us to get LOTS of photos.  What a treat and it made our trip to Redwood even more memorable!"
Redwood National Park,5.0,A Beautiful National/State Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful and incredible all year around, but a winter visit was on the schedule this time.  The winter storm made it somewhat challenging, but were still able to largely get to most places.  Staff at the Visitor Centers were friendly and helpful - esp considering some of the weather related closures.  Bald Hills Road was exciting in 10+ inches of snow.  Lady Bird Johnson Grove was a wonderful walk, as were a number of other trails."
Redwood National Park,5.0,Once in a Lifetime,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I had went on a trip to California and one thing I requested was see the redwood forest. This was a bit out of the way for us as we hit Yosemite and San Francisco in this trip totally 1500 miles. IT WAS WORTH IT. The drive was to no where but the view was fantastic and when we arrived finally I didn’t have words. Going through the Avenue of Giants was great but does not compare to the redwood forests. Prairie Creek has the best trail and trees. True monsters. I won’t be coming back to California anytime soon as we take a big trip every 2 years somewhere new but I would highly recommended this no matter the distance.
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Finally seeing the famous Sequoias!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a wonderful day in Mariposa Grove. Being our first time in Yosemite we knew the Sequoias in Mariposa Grove would be the first site we wanted to see. The area was busy and parking was very packed. There is a shuttle service to the trailhead which is very necessary (without the shuttle you would have to take a very steep 2 mile hike just to get to the trailhead). There are various hikes you can take and obviously the shorter routes are much busier. Have an idea prior to your trip on what you want to see to better determine the route you want to take. Our family went further than a majority of the crowds and made our way to the Telescope Tree (very cool to actually go inside a Sequoia!). Our ""custom"" hike was just under 6 miles. Take breaks and plenty of water especially on a warm day!"
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,"Great views of the sequias, but take the long hike!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved our visit to the mariposa grove.  Outside of Muir Woods in CA, this was our first visit to a large grove and it was really breathtaking.  Most folks on tours or visiting only go on the shorter trail. Take the long trail and see the trees around the upper grove.  We would have hiked more, but missed a few shortcuts we could have taken on perimeter trails They could use some better maps to show how the short cuts will save you time, especially for folks that dont want longer hikes.  Fantastic views for us with fantastic weather!"
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,one of the best experiences of my life.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"i am so very glad we got to experience this. my wife and I took our oldest here for her graduation present and it was such a great experience.  we came july 2020 during the coronavirus upheaval and couldn't get a day entry pass so we took the YARTS bus into the park and it dropped us of right at the grove parking lot, which is literally right next to the park entrance. we got there as early as the YARTS bus could get us there, so we arrived at the mariposa grove parking area/bus stop at 830am. since they aren't running the park shuttles we walked the trail from the parking area to the grove.  there was barely anyone else around, only maybe 10-20 cars in the parking lot.  we are very active people so the hike to the grove on the trail wasn't difficult and took us about 45 minutes to cover the 2 miles. once we got to the grove (I want you to listen carefully to me here), it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.  there was basically no one there.  i counted 11 other people  the entire time we were walking around the grove. it felt like we had it to ourselves and i felt so honored to have gotten that experience.  i have never had that feeling in nature before.  the trees are absolute giants and it was so cool to see them.  we sat for 15 minutes on the benches at/under the grizzly giant and just absorbed how large and awesome it is and didn't see another person the whole time we sat there.     we walked the rest of the Grizzly Giant Loop Trail and it was just as excellent as anyone could ever ask for.  we didn't rush ourselves and we spent a comfortable amount of time in the grove and enjoyed ourselves there.  we made it back to the grove parking area to catch the YARTS bus back out of the parking area about 1230 or so.  since we didn't know how long it would take us to get to the grove, we were hiking with a good bit of hustle, but were able to take our time in the grove and on the hike back to the parking area.  awesome experience, highly recommend.  if you decided to take the trail from the parking area to the grove, your shoes and lower legs are going to be absolutely covered in dust.  my wife and daughter used the time before the bus came one we got back to the parking area to wash their legs.  being the caveman that i am i chose to just stew in my grime."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,A L E R T  the   P U B L I C  >>> N P S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rangers were wrong. TIP: Read these 2021 posts people. No family should need to walk 6 miles to see these trees. I saw toddlers, little dogs and the elderly all on their near death hike to the trees during the heatwave. Many never made it. What a National Park Service (NPS) mistake this is! The Rangers are set up on wrong side of the visitor center. The public unknowingly walks to the trailhead without NPS input. You'd think someone is charge would step up. The Shuttles are not running. The New Visitor Center is now 2 miles away from the old Center so everyone with outdated guide books is ill prepared. Plan to see sequoias elsewhere."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Mariposa Grove - Yosemite,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since they have renovated and upgraded the area it's quite a place to visit! I visited in June and the grove is located  1hr south of Yosemite valley on hwy 41. After parking in a fairly large lot, you can either go to the store or jump on one of the buses that will drive  ( at no cost, since it's still in Yosemite) you to Mariposa Grove.  Once there you can wander at your own speed and take the various wide circuitous paths around the area. The trees are magnificent and are truly big! Some of their branches as bid as a normal tree!  If you want to see big Sequoias without the crowds this is the park in my opinion.  Buses were full but available."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Post Washburn Fire visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We shuttled up early in the morning to avoid the heat of the day.  The Mariposa Grove shuttle driver clearly explained where to get off the shuttle and where to get back on.  I noticed that the line to get back on the shuttle to head down has been updated with ropes to keep folks organized; when we visited in June, getting on the shuttle was just a pushy free-for-all. The return ride was about a 30 minute wait to board a shuttle.  Midweek, late Sept."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Not worth the hike,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you have ever seen a giant sequoia anywhere else-Muir Woods, N Coast, Kings Canyon, you can skip Mariposa Grove. I love to hike and I love trees, but this was so disappointing. 2 mile hike uphill through manzanita that was very exposed and hot then you get to the ""grove"" and there are very few trees! I was expecting a beautiful, lush, cooling hike and grove. Nope. Unfortunately fire damage and managed thinning has reduced this grove to a few trees. I would not recommend. There is no shuttle right now. Maybe if the shuttle is running it would be worth a quick look. "
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Giant Trees,4.0 of 5 bubbles,If you haven’t seen sequoias before it is about 30 miles from the west entry of El Portal side. There is a shuttle that runs during the summer. During the winter it is about an extra 4 mile round trip to get to the shuttle drop off up a hill or through the trail in the woods. There are some really large sequoias there like Grizzly Bear and the walk through tree.
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Beautiful area of Yosemite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an amazing way to spend a couple hours. This is right near the south entrance of the park. This section of the park had only been opened a couple days when we visited so the shuttles were not running. We left the parking lot about 9 and walked up the road. It took 50 minutes. Once we got up there it was REALLY snowy. The snow was pretty packed but we did slip and slide a little bit. For sake of time, we only hiked out to the tunnel tree (0.7) and then came back the same way. There are much longer hikes you can do if you want. It was a beautiful area of the park. Make sure you pack snacks and water and go to the bathroom before you go up. I would suggest doing this as early as possible to avoid large crowds. Great way to spend 3+ hours."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,"This walk will get your heart pumping, but well worth it.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is Yosemite, not Disneyland. So it’s nature at its best. This is hundreds of years of history in the making, it was never designed for humans to have an easy time seeing it. Having said that it has certainly been assisted in modern times to let us visit it. To give a balanced review we took the trail up from the main car park. $35 to enter Yosemite, but that lasts for 7 days. The walk up does have some fallen trees on it, of which most you walk around. If not, sit on it and slide over. It’s a steep walk and takes over an hour. Yes, it’s 2 miles. At that point you reach the car park, or if you had the appropriate badge, that’s where you park. Toilets were open and operational. Fallen Monarch road with easy access at this point is closed as there was damage to it. However easy access road to the left all the way to Bachelor and Three sisters is open, though to be honest if you are pushing a wheelchair it isn’t going to be easy. From here we walked the trail to Grizzly Giant and California Tunnel Tree. Total time at this point for a man of 60 years from entrance to Tunnel Tree took exactly one and a half hours. That was what I wanted to see so I can’t comment on anything else beyond. Return walk was down the road and was smoother but felt longer. No speeding traffic came past, just plenty of happy hikers with pleasant “Good mornings.” Total time to Tunnel Tree and back was 3 hours. Total distance 6.2 miles. Plenty of toilets available at various intervals, road or trail. If you are inspired by natures wonders well worth the effort. If you are looking for Disneyland and staff at every corner you are visiting the wrong location. Put simply, sorry to say but not everyone will be able to visit and enjoy it. For those that can, do. Another attraction nearby is the swinging bridge which is a lot easier to drive and walk to, which we did later, so consider that if you don’t want this strenuous hike."
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,TAKE YOUR TIME,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Please, please take your time on this trail!  Enjoy what you are experiencing!  We were passed by so many people that looked like they were in a rush.  WHY?  On the way back up, we were passed by people grumbling at each other because they were exhausted, but for some reason, never took a break.  I hate to tell you this, but there is no trophy waiting for you at the top."
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,Ooh Aah Indeed!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did sunrise at Ooh Aah point; it is a MUST!... Life is worth living for moments like this one. Not too many people either (it was my family + one couple there) so you can enjoy the moment of silence and solitude
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,Steep but worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You will get amazing views in 0.9 miles when you reach Ooh Aah point. At that point, you will be getting about 80% of the views, for 20% of the work. You can continue on to Cedar Ridge at 1.5 miles, or Skeleton Point at 3.0 miles, but you will pay for it on the hike back up to the rim. Restroom at Cedar Ridge, no water."
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,Go down to Skeleton Point to be right in the middle of the canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Make sure you have good hiking shoes with traction devices and poles, especially in winter. When going up, take your time, breathe and admire the scenery. It is around 3 hour hike going back up but it is definitely worth it."
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,Amazing Views Down to Ooh Aah Point,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took a short hike down to Ooh Aah Point.  Our hike was only a small fraction of the trail (about 0.9 mile one way), but with amazing views around every corner, we were still able to appreciate the grandeur of the canyon as we made out brief descent.  "
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,Awesome Views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I started this hike with the intention of only getting to Ooh Aah Point and then returning back. Since I traveled in September 2019, the Park Rangers suggested for hiking not to take place between the hours of 10AM - 4PM due to hot weather. "
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,One of our favorite hikes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the 6:00am hikers shuttle from Bright Angel Lodge to South Kaibab trailhead.    The bus was so full after the second stop that they didn’t even have any room for hikers at the third stop.  We saw an elk when we got off the shuttle.  Many people on this shuttle appeared to have plans beyond Skeleton Point (maybe Phantom Ranch or the other rim).  It was very crowded at the beginning of the hike. My husband and I were trying to take a relaxing, slower pace and we were getting passed by runners and people who seemed to be trying to make it to Ooo Ahh Point for sunrise.  Our plan was to hike to Skeleton Point and back for the 6 mile round trip.  We stopped for lots of pictures and a bathroom break at Cedar Ridge.  It took us about an hour and 50 minutes to make the 3 miles down.  At Skeleton Point we went to the left and were able to see the Colorado River and admire the views.  After Cedar Ridge the crowds really cleared out and we had that 1.5 miles almost to ourselves.  People were either way beyond us or turning around at Cedar Ridge.  The hike back up was tough, but it was not as bad as we were expecting.  Maybe we over prepared, but we had plenty of water, snacks and took very frequent breaks to catch our breath.  It only took us 2:45 to get back up with quite a lot of breaks.  All told we got in the trail at 6:30 and were back up by 11:30.  One of our favorite hikes we’ve done!  Some tips- bring lots of water, snacks, hiking poles, plan for an early start so you are back before noon if at all possible, and know your limitations before you head out."
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,Not to be missed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We waited until about 5:30 pm to do the 0.9 mile hike down to Ooh Aah Point. The temperature was perfect at this time even in August, following a thunderstorm. They hike down seemed further than a mile and I started to worry that the lookout point was unmarked- don’t worry, you can’t miss it! Breathtaking vista over the canyon in evening light was amazing. We took turns taking family photos with another group that was there at the same time and got some amazing shots. The hike back up was a bit strenuous with a lot of stairs- make sure to bring water and take it easy."
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,Strenuous hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the shuttle bus from the visitor center (which just started running again the day we made the hike) to the trail head entrance.  Plenty of people were parked on the side of the road for the hike, but they had to walk another 1/2 mile or so to get to trail.  We hiked to skeleton point, which is 6 miles round trip.  What an awesome strenuous hike in 110 degree temps.  Super fun with great views.  We actually hiked for about 2 minutes past skeleton to get a glimpse of the Colorado River.  I would suggest walking those extra couple minutes.  We only brought 2 bottles of water, a beer,  and an pack of ice (which we turned into another bottle when it melted).  This was NOT nearly enough with the heat this particular day!  Do NOT make the same mistake we did, and bring plenty of water; there are no filling stations on this hike!!  We had to ration the last part of the hike, which was not fun. There are bathroom facilities at Cedar Ridge which is at about the 2 mike mark.  Took us about 4.5 hours and we stopped for lunch and a beer, and a ton of pics along the way.  Great hike!!"
South Kaibab Trail,5.0,Love this trail to Skeleton Point - 6 Miles round trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"WOW! Our goal was to make it to “Skeleton Point” and we made it! It is 3 miles down with a round trip of 6 miles. We stopped at Ooh Aah Point, Cedar Ridge point (bathrooms) and then Skeleton Point. At Skeleton Point you will go to the left of the sign and you will see the Colorado River! We took our time and took lots of pics, it took us about 5-6 hours. We took a snack / lunch break at the final point and spent time resting up before our ascent. What they say is true, it will take longer getting up then going down. "
Eastern Promenade Trail,4.5,"Beautiful, large waterfront park",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked along the street on Eastern Promenade.  There are large beautiful homes along this street facing the park.  According to signs, the park has 68 acres (I think this includes the small section designated as Fort Allen Park) and the original design was done by the Olmsted Brothers.  The large grassy expanse and trails are well kept, and quite a few people were out enjoying the sunny afternoon and it felt very safe.  We saw people who appeared to be gathering for a small wedding.  There are benches and various historical markers scattered throughout.  There are great views of Casco Bay for watching boats go by.  You can see Fort Gorges out in the bay, and with binoculars you can see Bug Light, Spring Point Ledge Light, and Portland Head Light to the south."

Eastern Promenade Trail,4.5,Great weather for enjoying the Eastern Promenade Trail.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was a beautiful mid-June day when we went to the Eastern Promenade Trail. The views of the park and Casco Bay were great. The food trucks are back, there were tons of people picnicking and sunning on the lawns, and there were several people walking the trails. "
Eastern Promenade Trail,4.5,USS Portland,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The mast of the USS Portland is one of the many attractions here and has quite a history. The ship was launched in 1932 and scrapped by 1962, and it was one of the most decorated ships in the U.S. fleet.  Our late winter walk was a cold one, but the scenery was beautiful as usual, with the water a deep sapphire blue.  No food trucks this time of year, but there are several great restaurants in the area where you can get takeout and bring it to the park."
Eastern Promenade Trail,4.5,Scenic Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great place to stretch your legs, take in the fresh air, and enjoy the beautiful scenery. The trail ends in downtown Portland with shops and restaurants. We tried to come here early on a Saturday morning but it was crowded due to a half marathon. Thankfully, we came back a couple of hours later and enjoyed walking the trail before leaving Portland."

Eastern Promenade Trail,4.5,An excellent walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Walking here was the perfect Covid activity.  Fresh air and distance from others.  The scenery is relaxing and calming:  water views, historic homes.  We also had an app on the phone which uses the GPS feature to tell you about what you are seeing.  Fun to have the history lesson on a long walk.  Highly recommend."

It was a cool, windy day but the sun was shining and the views were lovely.  We walked just about a mile and back and would love to come back and spend more time here.  There was plenty to see and enjoy.  Definitely worth a visit."
Fiery Furnace,5.0,Get Tickets in Advance,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a great family hike (Ages 57, 55, 19, and 13).  The trail is not well marked and you will get ""lost"" for a little while many times.  It gets especially confusing in the middle of the trail, but if the way seems too difficult you are going the wrong way.  Eventually you make it out.  We were on the trail for about 3.5 hours.  There are a few challenging sections, but my not particularly brave wife made it through with only a few scares."
Fiery Furnace,5.0,Best Part of Arches in July,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You need a permit to access the Fiery Furnace and they are available on recreation.gov a week in advance.  There are no crowds in the Fiery Furnace because of the limit of permits, which was one of the reasons we liked it so much!!!"
Fiery Furnace,5.0,Awesome hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been to Arches National Park many times over the past 30 years and never did this hike.  Our hotel concierge recommended it, and we are so glad we did it!  You must get a permit at the Visitor's Center, and they only sell a limited number of permits each day (so buy early!).  After purchasing the permit you must watch a short video about the hike (don't litter, don't walk on the bio-crust, etc)"

Fiery Furnace,5.0,Absolutely a must do if you can get passes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was a bit intimidated about this hike - but, this ended up being the most fun I've EVER had on any hike! Juliet was absolutely wonderful. She kept a great pace with meaningful breaks throughout the entire morning. Juliet also demonstrated all of the technical aspects perfectly and made these sections interesting and fun - not scary or intimidating. This was absolutely the highlight of our 5 week adventure out west! Thank you, Juliet!!"
Fiery Furnace,5.0,Furnace Review ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was a lucky one and got tickets into the Fiery Furnace. Apparently there is an app of the trial you can download which came in handy for a lot of folks ... NOT US!!! I didn't even know about this until someone inside was offering us help to get back on the right path. The arrows they have in some places blend in so well, it's hard to find. This is especially in the rock climbing spots. Overall we had a great time, even if we got lost a few times and had to back track. I do recommend going early because once that sun comes out, you'll know why it's called the fiery furnace. Would we do it again, YES but with the app!! "
Fiery Furnace,5.0,It's back!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Fiery Furnace is open again after a year and a half! We snagged one of the first tickers. If you get lucky enough to score a ticket, do yourself a favor and get the guide on fieryfurnacetour.com because it will save your hike! Otherwise you'll most likely get lost and won't see the hidden arches."
Fiery Furnace,5.0,Frustrating Experience,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you enjoy getting lost, this is the trail for you.  I had researched this trail and knew it was easy to get lost, so I downloaded a guide.  The guide was great, but we still got lost.  I am not sure why the park does not put up better trail markers.  It seems they want people to get lost and frustrated.  It was pretty down there, but not worth the frustration of constantly having to retrace your steps and try to figure out where the heck you were.  There were also some physical aspects of climbing and maneuvering through the rocks that we just did not feel safe doing.  We did not make it all the way around and ended up turning around and going back the way we came in.  We wasted a good portion of our day getting the permit, watching the movie and getting the talk, and then getting lost.  I'm not sure where all of the positive reviews come from.  Everyone we encountered was lost and trying to find their way.  Not a fun way to spend your time."
Fiery Furnace,5.0,If you go via permit....,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the furnace today, no map, first time, permit only. There are 20 directional arrows throughout the trail.  With the exception of ONE arrow, the signage is enough to successfully navigate the trail.  #11, the sole arrow that is diagonal, indicates the trail veers left when actually it veers right. Cross the rocks and you will see on the right, “steps” in the rock.  "
Fiery Furnace,5.0,Stop at all overlooks,4.0 of 5 bubbles,All of Arches NP has awesome scenery every where you turn. The story boards are informative. Fiery Furnace is interesting and is not named because of heat. Short walk from the parking area to the observation point. Pull over at every look out to take in the unique beauty of this place.
Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,Shocked and disappointed by the visitor safety protocols and business practices at Indian Canyons.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Shocked and disappointed by the visitor safety protocols and business practices at Indian Canyons. After an unusual heavy rain and localized flooding the previous day, we were looking for a safe place to hike. As out-of-country visitors to Palm Springs, we chose the Indian Canyons, managed by the Aqua Caliente Tribe. "
Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,Andreas Canyon,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Reading the reviews of Indian Canyons, we 4 chose to walk/hike the Andrea loop. The line at the entry gate was about 20 cars long & the fee was $12 for adults & $9 for seniors. After parking we started on the easier incline trail to the right. After about 100 ft one of our party turned back & went back to the car as she couldn't make it up some of the med/large rocks on the trail. The 3 of us continued on & took lots of photos. Experienced hikers call this easy. We called it moderate as there are many areas where we helped each other step up & down large rocks, boulders & sand crevices. The variety of huge palms & the rock formations are beautiful & we enjoyed the last 1/4 mile the most, where the trail was a little more flat & we could see the creek flowing. DO take a water bottle, a tripod for selfies, but not walking sticks, as you'll need your hands for maneuvering on larger rocks. NOTE: this is NOT a flat trail for people with walking limitations."
Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,Beautiful view/ disgusting Porta Potties,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We enjoyed the hike and views even though it was crowded with people at the time we visited. The revenue from admission fees should be used to build modern restrooms. The stench and filth from the Porta Potties was too much. Apparently they had not been emptied for months.  The woman were not able to use them. Does the county regulate this?
Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,Andreas Canyon trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are multiple hiking trails in the area; we did the 1-mile Andreas Canyon trail. Rocky with a few modestly steep but short areas, but doable by hikers of all skills. We took about a half hour. Beautiful palm grove based around a flowing stream. Shaded picnic area as well. Take water. There is a gift shop at the Palm Canyon trailhead a few miles away but no services at this trail. Note: since the trailheads are on the Aqua Caliente Native American lands there is a modest entrance fee but we’ll worth it."
Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,A soul soothing experience.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you love the outdoors at all and want to have a pure outdoor experience, I highly recommend the hikes around Indian Canyons.  The palm tree-lined stream trail makes for a gentle, soothing, loop hike.  It really helped remind us of what this part of the desert must have been like before it was developed.  You don't need to be super athlete to enjoy the hikes labeled gentle.  If you want a more rigorous experience, there are hikes for you, too.  Ultimately, being at Indian Canyons was a soul soothing experience."

Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,Wonderful way to spend a day or an afternoon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the Murray Canyon trail. It was easy, and beautiful with some changing terrain..from flat desert in the sun to palm oasis with a bit of shade and finally to canyons near the end. You are walking along a small river that you do need to cross..we counted 16 times. The crossings are logs and rocks, mostly rocks. Easy to do but if you don't have hiking poles pick up a stick for some extra help balancing. It worked for me. We did this in January and the portion in the sun got hot, so make sure if the weather is warmer to bring plenty of water and take some breaks in the shade. Overall, we saw people of all fitness levels on the trail..it's very do-able."
Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,Being an active senior  I was glad I wore hiking boots even on this short and easy(?!) trail .,4.0 of 5 bubbles,My husband and I are active seniors. We advise other active seniors to consider wearing hiking shoes or boots for the Andreas trail.  Parts of this short trail are strewn with sand-covered rocks and stairs. I was comfortable navigating around them in my Merrill hiking shoes but felt sorry and a little worried for other members of the group who were wearing regular sneakers. 
Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,Beautiful old palm trees in a scenic canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There are choices of hiking trails if you want a scenic hike.  My favorite is Andreas Canyon as half of it is hiking through beautiful old growth palm trees along a running stream while the return loop is on higher open ground with far off views.  This time we saw tiny lizards and what we think was an iguana (about two feet long including it's tail).   It is a great trail for photography.
Indian Canyons Hiking Trails,4.5,"Nice hiking, admission fee, most trails well signed",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I did several hikes in the Indian Canyons area during my four week stay in Palm Springs. It is quite close to downtown and easy to get to. You do have to pay an admission when entering the area. A map is provided. I hiked the easy Andreas Canyon loop, the longer Murray Canyon loop (One of my favorites!), the Palm Canyon/Victor loop, and about half the very steep Maynard Mine trail. As you will see from the map you will get, many of the trails intersect so you can create your own shorter or longer hike as you want."
Old Rag Mountain Hike,5.0,"Awesome trip, very doable but BE PREPARED AND LEAVE EARLY",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was awesome!!! Super rewarding, excellent views, and really fun. Would definitely recommend going as early as possible. Me and my sister got there at 4:30am on a Saturday and half of the main parking lot was full. 4:30am-5:00am is most likely the best time to go because there were no lines, and comfortable room between hikers. We got passed a couple times as well as passing others but it was nothing crazy. Bring AT LEAST 2 liters of water. It’s a long hike so you are 100% going to need it. Me and my sister aren’t particularly in shape and completed the rock scramble w no problem (just lots of breaks). There are LOTS of narrow sections while bouldering so things will get increasingly harder for you the wider you are and you may have to be creative to finish."

It will test your endurance and strength, but is very doable for someone in moderately good shape. Like any National Park, the pictures don't do it Justice.  If you choose to do the loop, the Rock scramble is so much fun."
Old Rag Mountain Hike,5.0,So much fun!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a fun hike only a 2 hour drive from DC.  There is a reservation system in place for this hike.  Unfortunately, there were people in line ahead of us who made the drive and were unaware that reservations were required.  It is a nominal charge for the advance reservation.  From the trailhead, the hike climbed quickly which definitely earned it the rating of strenuous.  A lot of reviews discussed the danger of the rock scramble that hikers reach at about the 2.5 mile mark.  This is not a climb, but a scramble.  It is a little adventure around each corner.  Take your time and enjoy the scenery!"
Old Rag Mountain Hike,5.0,Awesome Hike with Fun Rock Scramble & Great View,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was amazing! We arrived at the Old Rag Parking lot at 8 AM to give us enough time to get up the mountain. We thought that the beginning of the hike was  pretty hard because it was an incline up over small rocks. When we reached the rock scramble we took our time and had a lot of fun! I think that the rocks scramble and the summit were everyone's favorite parts of the hike. We made it to the top at around 12:30 PM since we took a lot of breaks. We stayed at the top for a while and enjoyed the splendid view, then made our way down the other side. For us the trip down was the hardest, since it was the longest stretch and there were more gravel and rocks than on the way up. We ended the trail at around 4 PM."
Old Rag Mountain Hike,5.0,"Great family hike, fine for kids 9&10",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the loop from the Berry Hollow Parking Lot because we followed our vehicle GPS (oops) but it worked out just fine meaning we got a spot (mid-week around 10:30).  I left my Old Rag passes on my dashboard and the NP pass hanging from my rear view mirror because the lot didn’t have anyone there to check for the passes.  There was a Park Ranger checking for our Old Rag passes at the start of the loop about 0.8 miles from the parking area. We had two kids ages 9 & 10 with us.  We packed lots of water, sandwiches, snacks.  It was a great hike for all of us. It wasn’t crowded, only 1 short holdup to wait for someone to figure out how to get up one section of scramble. The kids were just big enough (tall & strong enough) to handle the scrambling with almost no assistance.  Doing the loop from Berry Hollow allowed us to start & end on a woods road.  The water sources were not really where we might have needed them, early and late in the hike (we always carry a water filter)."
Old Rag Mountain Hike,5.0,Best of Shenandoah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I googled Old Rag, and found a staged pic of craziness showing the “Leap of Faith” along the Ridge Trail. Given that I’m 68 and was hiking solo, I took the backside Berry Hollow Trail. It’s a beautiful trail in itself, winding through the forest and boulders with switchbacks and vistas. And everyone ends up at the same summit. The summit itself and its vistas on a clear day can’t be matched on the East Coast. The NPS description said to plan for 7 hrs but even with lunch and taking lots of photos, it only took only 5. Having now seen the Ridge Trail pics on this site, I’m game for going back solo and tackling it. This was flat out wonderful."
Old Rag Mountain Hike,5.0,"Seriously, Wear Gloves",5.0 of 5 bubbles,We parked at the Berry Hollow Parking hoping to do the loop in reverse. We soon learned that the mile long lines to pass through the Rock Scramble are only passable in one direction with the amount of foot traffic. It was so crowded!!

Old Rag Mountain Hike,5.0,Hard and Rewarding!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Old Rag is one of the harder hikes I have done thus far in my life. I was expecting it and was so proud of making it happen! We arrived to the parking lot a little before 8am on a Friday and had no trouble parking. We ran into people on the trail, but no issues with delays at all on the scramble. It was the weekend of the gas shortage, so that might have had an effect as well. "

Hobbit Trail,4.5,Lost magic,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail, even a few years ago still a magical tunnel through the enclosing vegetation, is now a blasted out, overused disaster.  Bandit trails wander all over the hillside and the crowds are constant.  It's great that people use it and apparently enjoy it, but so much has been lost here.  It would be wonderful if we could take better care of places.  Start by staying on the trail!"
Hobbit Trail,4.5,Beautiful forested hike with slices of ocean views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Two places to park at Heceta Lighthouse or the trailhead parking area further north on 101. It’s on the right hand side but there is no visible sign;however, more than likely lots of cars will be parked there. From this parking area, you can hike on the China Creek trail (same side of the road as parking area about 1 mile total) or across 101 is the Hobbit trail (1.5 miles one way) and Hobbit Beach trail (.5 miles one way). The Hobbit trail leads to the Heceta Lighthouse and is pretty hilly. There are some stairs built in here and there. Otherwise, it’s natural ground cover with slippery roots and muddy spots (even though it hadn’t rained in a long time).  There are benches here and there if you need a rest. The trail runs through a beautiful coastal forested area lined with tall Sitka spruce and rhododendrons. You actually expect to see a hobbit jump out somewhere. There are occasional ocean views notably of Hobbit Beach.  It took us about 2 ½ hours stopping to take lots of pictures. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!"
Hobbit Trail,4.5,Hobbit Trail along the Highway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Parking for this trail may be a challenge; hikers park on both sides of the road & there's not a lot of room for many cars there. Wear your hiking sandals for this one!  
Hobbit Trail,4.5,"Lovely fawns, trees, lush ",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Hobbit Trail down to Hobbit Beach is well worth the stop. Parking is limited, and the trailhead sign is small, but when you find it, it’s a very cool 1/2 mile hike down to the beach. Lush trees encompass you in a number of spots, and gives a magical sensation. The beach opens up wide when you reach it, and miles of scenic Oregon coast are there to enjoy. The hike back up is modest, it winds some, so it’s easier than if it was straight up. Lots of tree roots in the trail due to so much lush foliage, so watch your step, up and down.  Hike the trail if you have the time."
Hobbit Trail,4.5,A Fun Little Hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'm not a seasoned hiker,  and have a replaced knee,  however I was able to handle this short 1/2 mile hike down to Hobbit Beach with no problem.  Fair warning for those with mobility issues: there are a few steep places and tons of roots to clamber over.  The hike takes you to a very secluded beach with few people on it.  The short,  younger trees and shrubs will make you feel you've become a hobbit.  The hike back up to the freeway is much harder,  so save some energy.  Important: the trail head is across highway 101 from the trail head sign.  We didn't realize this and couldn't find it at first.  There's very little and awkward parking.  "

Hobbit Trail,4.5,"Path to the beach, not a hike",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"In blogs I got confusing info on this trail.  I would not call this a trail or a hike.  Instead it is a short but lovely path to the beach.  If you want to go to the beach, then take this path.  If you want a hike, then look elsewhere.  This is only a mile round trip."
Hobbit Trail,4.5,Whole trail from lighthouse to hobbit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Make sure you do the entire stretch of the trail! It truly is magical. From the views to the trees and not to mention the coastline, it is absolutely breathtaking! So glad there were a few benches along the way and pop outs for perfect pictures. A must do!"
Hobbit Trail,4.5,Good short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice, un-crowded hike to a wide, un-crowded beach.  The trail is steep at points, but it is short.  It is not hard to follow the trail.  The beautiful beach a the end is a nice payoff.  The beach slope is extremely shallow, so high tide vs low tide will make a big difference in how much beach is available for walking."
Hobbit Trail,4.5,"Hidden Gem (and like the Shire, too!)",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our first trip down the Hobbit Trail to Hobbit Beach.  I grew up in Oregon, and didn't know about it until I read about it here, on trip advisor.  All I can say is, ""Wow!""  The trail is lovely, shaded with moss covered trees and rhododendrons.  The trail is rough in some spots, tree roots wait in ambush (ask me how I know).  Some of the stairs have lost their foundations, leaving gaps where there should be steps, so do be watchful.  All in all, the trail was wonderful, and led to a most secluded beach, somewhat protected from the wind.  We went with family aged 6-70 and everyone LOVED it!  The trail is about ½ mile long."
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,"A great hike, with views of Exit Glacier!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Even though it was raining, we decided to go on this hike. The trailhead for the Harding Icefield trail is about 0.3m from the parking lot. Before starting we headed to the Glacier View Overlook trail which is about a mile i think. Returning from that we headed to the Harding Ice Field Trail. You need to sign-in at the box at the start of the trail. "
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,Epic Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We just did this hike and it was truly a once in a lifetime experience! I was super worried that I wouldn’t be able to make it all the way but I did! I m 56 yrs old and in relatively good shape, but not in great shape! We took it slow and  made it to the end! We took plenty of breaks on the way up and were much faster coming back down after a long break at the top! It was sooo worth it! The views are phenomenal. Also be bear aware! 1.5 miles up we heard a startling grunt beside us on the trail. Then brush snapping and another grunt! We hustled as fast as we could to get out of that forested section! At the end we checked in with the ranger and were told it was a black bear that other hikers actually saw 15 minutes behind us on the trail. That was scary so make sure you take precautions ! Also, like others have said, we clocked the mileage and it came to 10.2. It’s longer than what you see posted! Do it- you won’t regret it!!"
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,Worth doing at least part way,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked with an 8 and 12 year old and made it to Marmot Meadow.  We could have gone higher but there was snow on the trail even when we stopped.  Great views along the way and came surprisingly close to a black bear - so be aware on the trail.  Would love to go back to reach the top.
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,One tough hike that is worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one tough hike. Be prepared to spend a good portion of the day on this one.  Steady uphill climb for the first 4 miles, but the views from the top are well worth it.  I would suggest trekking poles, plenty of water and snacks. Our total hike from parking lot to the edge of the ice field and back was 11.5 miles. Get there early because the parking lot fills up by mid morning.  This is a busy trail, so don't think you will be out there alone., "
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,Epic hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Outstanding hike. Well maintained trail. Majestic views. Wish we would have trained for it. We did make it to the very top. It took us all of 8hrs and I would have liked to rest more both up and down. Trekking poles were very helpful  climbing rocks and on snow near the top in mid-July. Lots of great views 1/2 to 3/4 to top, so possible to make a little shorter and still great hike. Top is amazing though."
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,Views worth every step of the hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This ~8 mi round trip hike is absolutely worth it. It’s a bit of a tough trail at parts but doable if you pack the right gear (layers, good hiking boots, rain layers, and a good winter hat). It can get cold and rainy up on the field. The views are breathtaking and continue to get even better as you get higher and higher."
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,One of the best hikes ever! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have hiked all over the world. This is, without question, one of the best hikes I have ever done.

Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,"Amazing hike, Top Alaskan experience",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this trail with our 10 and 8 year old children.  We were very lucky that the weather was perfect.  I actually planned our Alaskan trip around this hike.  I had initially wanted to come to Alaska a few years ago.  But knowing that our kids wouldn’t be able to make the hike, I decided to put off our entire Alaskan trip until the kids are old enough to do it.  And I am glad we made that decision.  It’s a very tough hike.  The total distance is about 8 miles round trip, and you gain 3000ft in elevation.  The good thing is that the elevation itself is not bad, starting at 500ft, ending around 3500ft.  "
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,Plan Ahead on your stopping point,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are various descriptions of how long this hike is. According to my experience, the trail head is 0.4 miles from the visitor center, and the trail is 3.9 miles one way. So in total it’s 8.6 miles from the visitor center. There is also a little over 3000 feet elevation gain from the visitor center to the end of the trail. The mile markers in my review are all from the trail head. Mile 1.3 is the Marmot Meadows viewpoint. There is a giant relatively flat rock just a little off the trail that you can see Exit Glacier very well. This point is a little over 1000 feet elevation gain, so the hike up to this point is certainly not considered easy at all. This is the first good point for you to turn back. The next good turning back point is at mile 1.6, Bottom of Cliffs. The final turn back point is at mile 2.3, Top of the Cliffs. The difficult hike becomes really strenuous after this point and honestly the view of the Glacier does not get better until you get all the up to the end of the trail. The day we were there, it was misty to begin with, and it became a steady rain by the time we got to the Top of the Cliffs. We came prepared with rain poncho. I want to give a shout-out to my kids, ages 9 and 13. I wouldn’t have made it if it wasn’t for the fact that they were so much ahead of me and couldn’t hear me calling them back, so I was left with no choice but to keep climbing up with the rain right in my face and wind blew against me. I want to emphasize the hike up is STRENUOUS and you really need good hiking shoes to keep you from slipping and your feet from getting wet. There are areas on this trail where you don’t see Exit Glacier at all, and it’s all black rock that made me feel like I was on Mars. I am beyond proud that we made it all the way up. There is an emergency shelter at mile 3.6. It’s small shelter with a couple of snow shovels. There is no bench or anything to sit on. It was an interesting read of who’s being there from the writings on the wall as I sat on the floor to rest. "
Harding Ice Field Trail,5.0,Great hiking experience for the whole family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the trail in mid-July. We started out late in the early afternoon. Due to the long day light hours in the summer of Alaska, we made it back before it was getting dark.  The trail is not easy but manageable. Our 9 to 13 year-old kids and their 75 year-old grandma made all the way to the ice field. The first part was hot. The middle part was hard since some of the large rocks were hard to climb for a young kid and elder. The last part was easy but cold. So dress in layers and bring enough water and some snacks. The view was changing along the way which was absolutely mesmerizing. The view at the ice field was breathtaking. We spent a couple of hours at the top. Along the trail, we saw a lot of mountain goats and had two close encounters with two black bears. Each time, the bear just run away.  The hiking experience and the breathtaking views are worth all efforts. Definitely a must if your family enjoy hiking."
New River Trail State Park,4.5,Great asset to the area,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Wish there was some more info about what is along each stretch so we could pick a trailhead accordingly. It’s a nice flat walk that leads you to being almost fully submerged in nature. Great for forest bathing and getting in daily walks. There is a $5-7 parking fee at each lot.
New River Trail State Park,4.5,A Spectacular Trail to Ride a Bicycle,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rode my bicycle on the New River Trail from Galax to Pulaski.  It was a great ride, but I would not do it in late September again.  There were black walnuts on many sections of the trail, making bike riding much more difficult.  Still, the NRT is so beautiful that it was very enjoyable.  The view of the river and all of the bridge and trestle crossings made it an amazing adventure.   I was proud that a 72-year-old guy could ride the 57.7-mile ride.  I might just do it again."

New River Trail State Park,4.5,Gorgeous spring ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did the entire trail in 2 out and back halfs.   It is a very scenic trail along water most of the way.  What a great way to spend 2 days on our bikes.  Definitely would recommend this and would do it again.  If you only have time for half the trail, the Galax to Shot Tower end was the most scenic--it followed the Chestnut Creek with a few small rapids/waterfalls along the way."

New River Trail State Park,4.5,Enjoyed ourselves :),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started at the trail access in Galax, VA (208 E Stuart Dr, Galax, VA 24333) and took a nice 2 mile walk to the ""Cliffside Overlook"" and back (4 miles total), although we must have missed something because once we went the 2 miles that it claimed would bring you to the overlook...there was nothing. Not sure if we needed to go further or what, but we never found it. We had to turn back since it was still a 2 mile walk back and daylight was fading, otherwise we would have kept going in search of it. "
New River Trail State Park,4.5,Great trail for fall section rides!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful fall rides on hybrid bikes. We did section rides using New River Estate (AirBnB) in Allisonia as base. Did round trips Galax to Fries Junction on drive in. Allisonia to Shot Tower from front door of AirBnB. Allisonia to Draper for lunch. Foster Falls to Ivanhoe Bridge on way home. Nice rides on crushed gravel. Lots of bridges and some tunnels along New River. Park has composting toilets along trail. Pay $7 to park if not riding from your accommodations
New River Trail State Park,4.5,Inn at Foster Falls (10 rooms),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Inn at Foster Falls is a hidden gem for sure.  Situated on a beautiful piece of land in Wythe County, VA, this was an orphanage at one time but has been well refurbished by the State of Virginia and is now serving as an Inn.  The New River Trail State Park is just adjacent to the Inn and has campgrounds, trails, and some beautiful scenery.  The rooms in the Inn were huge and many had access to the balcony over looking the park.  We do want to go back!  The breakfast was referred to as a continental breakfast. It was serve yourself but was hot, tasty, and ample."

The Noland Trail,5.0,Nice Shaded Walking Trail For the Family-,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were visiting relatives in Newport News, and asked for a nice walking trail, they recommended the Nolan trail. This is a nice shaded trail that winds around a lake, very clean and well marked and maintained. I believe the entire loop is 5 miles, we did a 2 mile course, and did not have to go in and out, which I like.  Would do this again for sure! Great for dog walking, jogging, and/or small children. There a few inclines if you choose to take those trails."
The Noland Trail,5.0,Great In Town Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Noland Trail is a wonderful 5 mile trail through woods and along several lakes.

Crowded on the weekends but still nice."
The Noland Trail,5.0,What a gift!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Over several days of my visit, I was able walk the whole trail. There are several entrance to get onto the trail.

The Noland Trail,5.0,5 beautiful miles through nature,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Until I visited this place I did not know Newport News could be so beautiful. This a five miles trail through forest, lake wonderful for a hike or bike. You will encounter scenic sites throughout the journey. I always prefer to enter from the James river side. Sometime I don't finish the trail, return along the same path and watch the sunset over James River by the side of the Mariner's museum. After a long work day this is a breath of fresh air."
The Noland Trail,5.0,Noland Trail Technician,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"the noland trail is a 5 mile wooded trail non paved but maintained by myself. A common misconception is that the trail is maintained by the city, The noland trail and museum are privately funded and maintained by hard working individuals and volunteers. The noland trail is a fun relaxing place for people of all ages to visit. After a week of working on the trail all day I still enjoy to walk the entire 5 miles with my dog on the weekends. Security has also been ramped up on the trail making for a safer and more pleasant experience."
The Noland Trail,5.0,"Breath taking views, year round.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is my favorite place to take a walk!  The trail is long ( I believe 5 miles +) around a beautiful lake.  It has numerous entrances to paths so it doesn't matter where you park to walk.  What I like to do since I never have time to walk 5 miles, is pick a different entrance every time and walk 20-30 minutes in one direction and then come back....that way, every time I go, I get to see different views.  The trail is beautiful rain, sun, snow, fall, winter, spring, summer... I walk with my dogs as depending on what time you walk, there may be long stretches where you never see another human being ;) but I like the tranquility of it and have always felt very safe.  The trail is well maintained so after storms, you can expect someone out there clearing the trails.... If you have never walked this trail, give it a try.  It is almost a spiritual experience for me.... just so beautiful and peaceful .... lots of scenic overlooks if you are a photographer....also great to shoot photos for portraits, (bridal, family, etc)   If you are out of town, come walk and see probably some of the best views Newport News has to offer ;)  Wear good walking shoes!  Strollers and Pets allowed :)"

Mt. Healy Overlook Trail,4.5,Worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This one was tough but so worth it.  Constant up all the way, no breaks.  We took our time and thank goodness I had my hiking poles to help on the way down for my knees.  The view is spectacular!

Mt. Healy Overlook Trail,4.5,fun trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Mt. Healy overlook trail offers the chance to climb a rather impressive looking mountain.  At the base of the mountain the rocky face of the overlook stands out and appears much higher and grander than it is, making the hike all the more enjoyable.  I have hiked the overlook trail maybe nine times in the five months I spent in the park and everytime was an adventure.  Once atop the overlook it is customary to pose with the sign and gaze at ""Downtown Denali"" in the adjacent valley.  I would recommend this trail to the novice hiker."

Mt. Healy Overlook Trail,4.5,moderate trail with sweeping views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The prepared (but not necessarily advanced) hiker will find terrain ranging from a gravel path through birch and spruce forest, to relatively steep but well-maintained switchbacks below and above the tree line. At the top of the overlook, and to some extent on the way up, you'll be treated to stunning views of the Nenana River, and the mountains surrounding the park entrance. There is a social trail that continues beyond the overlook to the summit, and adds at least another mile (one way) to the distance, so bring plenty of water (1.5 L per person should be fine), a hearty sandwich, and a couple of energy bars, in case you wish to continue. We found that the views improved for about another half mile or so along the ridge, but the only point in continuing beyond that is the satisfaction of reaching the summit."
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,A hike well worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a very nice hike, but the way to access the trailhead is more than ambiguous. Google will take you down a dirt road and announce you are there when in reality you are nowhere close. There are multiple ways in, and coming from the south one has to pay close attention to the desired destination."
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Drift Creek Falls Hike (November 2022),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just beautiful hike! Just wait until you get to the suspension bridge! Drift Creek Falls is an easy, just over 3 mile hike. It is mainly a gentle, downhill hike with uphill hike on the return. Nice dirt trail, muddy in a few spots due to recent rains. There is the common root wad or rocks along the trail so just watch your step. Beautiful falls. Beautiful forest."
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Stroller not advised,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lots of downhill on the way to the bridge and so uphill on the way back. Baby stroller not advised. Too many roots to have to lift the stroller over and it was bumpy for the little baby. Ended up carrying the baby all the way back and still having to lift the stroller over the roots. The bridge and waterfall was a satisfying view to end at.
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,fun waterfall and suspension bridge hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very simple downhill hike to the waterfall, about 1 mile one way. Very beautiful and scenic hike with streams and rivers.  The trail is quite muddy in the winter but in the spring and summer very dry and nice.  If going in the winter be sure to see what the snow level is at as you may encounter snow."
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful falls but...please read this first!!!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Husband and I went up to the falls as we had read reviews...easy hike, mostly downhill...what goes down must come up again, people. Be prepared.  We were both dealing with back conditions and sciatica, so please be aware that this might be an easy hike for those who are in good condition.  Moderate hike for those in average condition and can be difficult for those who are dealing with issues. It took us about 2 1/2 hours round trip including all the resting we had to do and enjoying the view of the falls and suspension Bridge.  Please be prepared. We were not because of all the reviews saying easy hike. I hope people will read this one too."
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Great hike to the beautiful falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I went on this hike to the beautiful falls. It is about 3 miles round trip. It was very peaceful as we went early. More people started to show up later in the morning. If you are afraid of heights and bridges, you might not want to go as the suspension bridge sways a little. But you can't see the falls unless you go out on the bridge. After you cross the bridge you can take the trail down to the bottom of the falls. The entire hike back up to your car is a little tiring so hopefully you are in good shape. If you do go, be sure to have something to write with as you will have to fill out a form. After you fill out the form you put 5 dollars in the envelope and drop in a box. Be sure to bring a camera. This is well worth the drive and hike."
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,A pleasant drive and hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Leave Lincoln City headed south.  After 1/2 mile, turn right on Drift Creek Road for 12 miles (a paved forest service road).  $5 fee to the Forest Service for parking at the Trail Head.  A very flat 1 mile hike to a spectacular 75ft waterfall.  An additional feature is the suspension foot bridge over the creek - don't worry, it is structurally supported so it barely sways.  Great way to spend a couple hours, plan another hour if you take a picnic lunch.  Following the Forest Service Road North for another 8 miles will bring you to the Drift Creek Covered Bridge.  On private land but just adjacent to the road and the owner's are proud to have people stop and enjoy their restoration work."
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,One of my new all time favorite hikes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a terrific hike! Here's a few things you should know: 
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Nice little hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is right outside of Lincoln City on the Oregon Coast. It is a great trail for family and anyone who wants an easy hike.  There is a 240 ft. suspension bridge, which overlooks Drift Creek Falls. I highly suggest hiking down to the falls (stay to the right at North Loop) then take the North Loop trail on the way up. Just stay to your right. There's a $5 parking fee."
Drift Creek Falls Trail,4.5,The trail is lovely; the drive to the trail is scary,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It too us two attempts to actually find the road to the Drift Creek Falls.  The road off of Hwy 101 is pretty straight forward.  When you dead-end you take a right and go half a mile or so and then take a small road uphill on the left.  It's very easy to miss and the signage is very very small.  We missed it the first time and ended up on a gravel road to no-where.  If the road turns to gravel, you are on the wrong road.  When you are on the right road, there is still a lot to challenge the driver.  It's 11 miles from the turn and it is hard to drive over 20 to 25 mph.  The road twists and turns and there is a constant possibility that you will be confronted with a driver going in the opposite direction.  The road is narrow, maybe a lane and a half wide, all of the way to the trailhead.  Going around tight corners and in & out of sunlight, you are constantly challenged to see.  Sometimes going from bright sun light into the darkness of shade, you can't see a thing.  So, it took us a full half hour to drive the 12 miles each way.  Fortunately we met only one car although it was at a curve and a little dicey.  The trail itself is lovely and well-maintained.  It is a graduated descent to the suspension bridge and falls which are the payoff to the 1.5 mile hike from the trailhead.  There is a reasonable pit toilet at the trailhead.  Oh and there's a $5 charge for day use."
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,High chance to get windows broken,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Parked our car on the side of road. As we walked to the trail head, noticed several cars with windows broken into. Decided to just go back to our car. There must be a homeless settlement in the woods. Easy to see the paths where they come and break into the cars."
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,too many dogs!,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"I used to love the green belt.  I've gone to various parts for 20 years.  In the past few years more and more people are finding their way there which would be okay except for the fact that every one and their dog brings their dog. Which would be endurable if they adhered to the leash laws.  I love dogs, have one of my own, but I leave him home.  Why?  Because when there does happen to be water running (rare, unfortunately) and I find a quiet spot to sit and enjoy the sound of rushing water I'm continually bombarded by dogs barking, growling, attacking one another, walking across me and shaking water all over me.  Ruins the experience.  Last two times I came home with gashes across my legs from dogs walking across me (with nearby owners smiling?).   I wish Austin PD would hand out more tickets.  I don't care about all the pot smoking - it smells like old memories and pot smokers are a quiet, peaceful group.  So leave the pot smokers be but discourage the free roaming dogs."
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,Beautiful swimming hole.  Tranquil rapids and soothing cold water on a hot summer day.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So much fun just swimming, picnicking and having fun.  The easiest way to access some great spots without having to walk five miles.   3900 Mopac Frontage Rd, Austin, TX 78746, from this location you can access swimming within 100 yards or walk a little farther to get to the popular Twin Falls area. "
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,My Favorite Spot in All of Austin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I usually hit the Greenbelt at the 360 (Capitol of Texas Highway) access point, but have entered at nearly all places. I've been there in the hottest of summertime to the coldest winter days. I've walked the blistering boulder-strewn dry creek bed, and have seen Barton Creek flowing like it came out of a fire hose. I've climbed the Hill of Life and hiked to where the creek empties into the Colorado River (that's not a lake, folks), on both sides. I've seen the vegetation greener than the greenest of greens, and burnt to a crisp from drought. I've biked and hiked, sweated and bled on those trails, and have thousands of images to show for my efforts."
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,nice urban Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very nice urban trail. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that outside of it's length it is just not that tough to do. It's a nice walk in the woods. Went out about 8AM and the small parking lot at 360 and Mopac was already 1/2 filled. A Saturday or Sunday..... I'd say be there at daylight if not before the parking area is pretty small. Now about the trail. This trail follows Barton Creek through quite an impressive canyon. The trail splits to the left along the creek and I stayed Creekside as much as possible. And the creek was running full although I have heard at times there is no water running just the deep pools of stagnant water. Along the trail are some very visible sights. 1st comes the Twin Falls. These were running well on this day. Next is Sculpture Falls. This impressive falls is not particularly high but weaves it's way through the limestone at various places with a large limestone out cropping  in the center. Next there were a couple of small unnamed cascades. At the far end is the Hill of Life Dam a very impressive water feature. After visiting the dam you might as well climb the Hill of Life which is the only tough part of this 6.5 mile hike. You will leave the dam at an elevation of 510 feet and in 1?2 mile you are standing at 825 feet so it is quite a climb up. Why is it called the Hill of Life? I dunno but I saw numerous runners run down and go right back up so maybe it's a health thing. The trail is well worn and well marked. There is a mile post every 1/4 mile but most of them have been vandalized so the mile marker is gone. On most someone has used a black sharpie to write the mileage back on. I don't know why there can't be more respect for property. Shoes... since I moved to Texas one thing I have discovered, limestone is almost always damp and slick unless in the direct sun so wear good shoes. I have even grown to love the trekking pole because of the slippery limestone. And I saw many instances of dog pooh ON THE TRAIL! Come on folks if your gonna take your dogs out clean up after them or get them off the trail before they do their duty. If I step in it bushwhacking that's on me if I step in it on the trail well that's on YOU! Well worth the time this one but again get there early especially on weekends."
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,"Overcrowded, overused, overtrashed, over dogpooped - Stay away",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Barton Green Greenbelt used to be a nice hangout for nature lovers in Austin. Well, then growth happened and armies of people have destroyed the greenbelt. Trails like highways, plastic trash everywhere, destroyed vegetation, civilization trash like entire bridges picnic tables etc in the dirty water and so forth does not make for a healthy place anymore. And on top of this development is more and more encroaching into the green. The greenbelt went down with Austin due to armies of migrants coming in from everywhere. Very sad."
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,The best day we had in Austin,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were a little confused about where to enter but started at the Barton Springs pool parking lot. Pretty easy hike to some beautiful falls/rapids. The kids wore bathing suits and had so much fun playing in the rapids. Lots of poison ivy along the trail, just be aware. "
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,A beautiful easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful walk in the spring when the water is flowing. In March, before everything is leafed out you get to see more of the Creek while you are walking. The first part of the walk is downhill, but not difficult to traverse, until you get to the riverbed area, and it is basically flat after that, all the way to sculpture falls. The walk to twin falls only takes about 20 minutes. It is definitely worth it to keep going to sculpture falls. I would say its approximately an hour total  (each way), if you are going slow and stopping a lot. Neither of these are actually ""waterfalls"" - I would consider them to be rapids- but the water is flowing over the rocks in beautiful formations in these areas, and is definitely worth the walk. Between the 2 ""falls"" you will pass two massive live Oak trees on your right that are really something to see. There are also pretty limestone outcroppings.  Note that when you are heading back to the parking area the trail splits in a not very noticeable way, and you can accidentally keep going straight (as I did), and miss the upward climb to the parking area. There is a little marker with a left pointing arrow there - look for it.  Another hiker told me that you can enter this trail at the ""twin falls"" marker on google maps where MoPac  and 360 merge, as I did - or you can start at the other end - off of loop 360 where Scottish Woods Trail comes to a T intersection. There is a parking area at that end of the trail as well.  I am going to try that half of the hike next!"
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,Stunning Views - Hard to Believe Your In Texas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I lived in Austin for over 3 years, and never made it to the Greenbelt. Shame on me. I went this past weekend, and it was glorious. Be warned, the Greenbelt is massive, and it's very possible to walk and not find a watering hole. The best way is to take the entrance off of Capital Highway. There are a couple of other spots, but are hard to find if you haven't been there before. Be prepared for at least a mile walk. Depending on where you park, the hike could be easy or moderately difficult. The Greenbelt is beautiful, with a running river, caves, trees, tons of walking paths, little beaches, rock cliffs and so much more. Definitely worth your time. Enjoy!"
Barton Creek Greenbelt,4.5,Many Different Facets to the Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,What many people don't know about this greenbelt is that is an 8 mile track that keep you busy for hours.  I'm surprised when I mention of the Hill of Life and get quizzical looks...so here's the rundown.
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,Sioux Falls Pathways.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sioux Falls bike trails are some of the best in the country. Our little town out performs most other cities. Great job city planners.
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,Fantastic!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We live about an hour away from Sioux Falls, but had never biked the Greenways Trail System until last week. What a wonderful experience! The trail is wide and well-surfaced, and it takes riders past several beautiful parks as it wends its way around the river. We did the 20 mile loop, beginning at Falls Park, and stopped along the way to eat the picnic lunch we had packed. We are pleasure bikers in our '60s and had no trouble at all with this trail as hills were few and there was a lot of shade along the way. We will definitely return!"
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,"Great bike trail, but things to know...",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented bikes at a local shop (TWD) and started trail in downtown Sioux Falls. Headed north and had an easy, quick ride to Falls Park. Decided to keep going north but did not realize that the trail quickly gets far out of town with no options to get off (stores, food, etc) for the bulk of the north 1/2 of trail. There are restrooms and water fountains along the way (but few and far between). It's an amazing trail, we just weren't prepared. Also, strong head wind so kids had a tough time. Ended up veering off and heading back to downtown Sioux Falls where we dropped kids off and jumped back on the south loop of trail. Well maintained, and paved wide lanes the whole way. Overall it's a fantastic 27-mile loop. Just make sure you're ready if you want to do the whole thing."
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,Great trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I ride the loop of this trail an average of 3-4 times per week. It is truly the good, bad, and the ugly of Sioux Falls! Love it. It takes you by 3 golf courses, the zoo, the airport (watch the fighter jets take off and land), the penitentiary, Smithfield pork processing plant, and the crown jewel of Sioux Falls: Falls Park. Then there are the parks and the deer and just...You name it. They are improving it, too, by making it wider and straighter. We are pretty serious road bikers but I prefer the bike trail because I feel it's safer."
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,What a Park system. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This will be a great bike trip. Miles and miles of trails takes you all around the city. Green grass, shaded paths and follow the Sioux river. This city takes pride in their town and it shows."
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,A comfortable days worth of riding with lots of side parks along the way,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Encircling the entire city is an easy to ride bike trail.  Paralleling the Big Sioux River, the bike path is actually the top of the levee built on either side of the river for a good portion of the trail. Multiple access points are available at major cross streets, but you’ll either ride your bike down under the streets, so you never have to stop for traffic. Multiple abandoned train bridges cross the river and have now been lined with wooden roadways for bikes to be able to cross from side to side. "
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,Absolutely worth the ride!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"On a first time visit to SF, we rented bikes from a local company and had them delivered to our hotel downtown.  Beautiful 19.1-mile paved loop trail that traverses Falls Park, tons of city parks, two golf courses, and even the back of the zoo!  Stooped for a great lunch at the Falls Overlook Cafe (11am-3pm)!"
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,Absolute must do.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail system is absolutely amazing in Sioux Falls. Bike, run, walk, it is beautiful! There are some really breathtaking spots along the trail that make you feel so far from the city. It is well maintained and I feel safe alone or with my family."
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,Sioux Falls bike trails user friendly!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"With over 20 miles of bike trails circling the town with many places to pit stop for a beverage or treat, the trail is very family friendly. Stops at Falls Park, Downtown Sioux Falls, or the Great Plains Zoo are all doable.  Users of all ages can be found on the trail walking, biking or running and are very courteous to other participants. E-bikes are now welcome on the trail. Get out and enjoy!"
Sioux Falls Bike Trails,5.0,Wonderful walking/biking trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Love this trail. The section we walked was nice and wide for both bikers and walkers. Parts are shaded and the scenery is very pretty. Water fountains along the trail are a nice bonus. It runs along the river. Parts are quiet and peaceful while some parts are near traffic. Lots of people and dogs made it feel safe. Great addition for healthy minded people to get some exercise. 
West Hartford Reservoir,4.5,Reservoir in West Hartford is a gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The reservoir on Farmington Avenue in West Hartford is lovely.  Many families walking, biking and jogging. Wonderful place to take your dog for a long walk.  The reservoir - our source of clean water in West Hartford - is beautiful. "
West Hartford Reservoir,4.5,Peaceful 3 mile walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I've been walking the reservoir since I moved to West Hartford in 2001. I moved away several years ago but I make an annual trip home and never miss a chance to walk the reservoir. One of the areas little treasures!

West Hartford Reservoir,4.5,Delightful walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are actually two West Hartford Reservoirs.  One is off of Farmington Avenue, and the other is reservoir #6 on Avon Mountain, Route 44.  Both reservoirs are delightful in their own way.  I found the reservoir off of Farmington Avenue to be excellent for bike riding with a clearly marked path.  For walkers be aware that there are hills, but the views are beautiful.  "
West Hartford Reservoir,4.5,A treasure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The reservoir is a heavenly gift to us all!  Even saw swans here in addition to the usual geese.  Bikes, walkers, runners all in harmony!"

West Hartford Reservoir,4.5,We Ha Reservoir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the loveiest places to go in West Hartford or WeHa to the locals! 
West Hartford Reservoir,4.5,Great place to walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Some of the best walking is on the dirt paths, which are less used that the pavement and therefore give a more immediate and restful experience of nature's wonders. (Sometimes the loud chatting of one's fellow creatures gets to be quite annoying for those seeking peace and quiet.) Dogs are  supposed to be kept on a leash, but there's rarely anyone about to enforce the rules, which is too bad. I don't think JohnX269 explored the reservoir's full potential, which is also too bad."
West Hartford Reservoir,4.5,The King & I,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My 3 y/o American bulldog, King, and I went for a stroll to take in the views and kill some free time. Beautiful place. Peaceful. Cool little creatures and critters. Will definitely visit again!"
Rubicon Trail,5.0,One of the most gorgeous trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Rubicon Trail is one of the best long trails in the Lake Tahoe area.  The hike could start from Eagle Point in Emerald Bay State Park and go all the way to Calawee Cove in the north over a distance of about 7 miles (oneway).   The trail wraps around the Emerald Bay and provides gorgeous views of Lake Tahoe the whole way.  There are several intermediate access points to get on the trail.  Water is available at campgrounds along the trail, though it is insurance to carry water, especially on hot days.  The trail is very well maintained and easy to follow.  At the north end there is an alternate trail that goes by the old lighthouse; be aware that this section is a pretty steep climb.  "
Rubicon Trail,5.0,"Gorgeous views, great swimming along the way",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked on the road which is not very safe but free. Trail starts at the base of a road and winds along the lake. Gorgeous views, swimming and picnicking spots. Not too difficult but save ene by for the climb back."
Rubicon Trail,5.0,Beautiful views the entire way,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views of Emerald Bay were spectacular most of the hike. We only walked part of the trail - from the top to the bay to go swimming before heading back up.  We saw  a lot of evidence of bears on the trail, but didn't see a bear.   The trail is narrow enough that it makes passing other a bit difficult, but doable.  I would definetly hike this trail again- but next time - the entire trail. Note: To get to the trailhead, you need to pay admission to the park and drive to the back parking lot. Park, walk around the parking lot to the left and near the little seating area, you will see the sign at the trailhead."
Rubicon Trail,5.0,Early morning stroll down from DL Bliss,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Did a small portion of the trail from DL Bliss towards Emerald Bay. Early in the morning, before 8 am no one was on the well used trail and it was lovely. By 9 am though lots of folks going the same way down to Emerald Bay as we hiked back up to the campground. None the less a lovely stretch of Lake Tahoe shoreline. "
Rubicon Trail,5.0,One of the most beautiful hiking trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked from Vikingsholm to almost the end of the Emerald Bay left side. This is definitely one of the most beautiful hiking trails we've ever been to. The weather around Emerald Bay in July is very nice, not too hot. The hiking trail is pretty easy. Good spots for lake access. "
Rubicon Trail,5.0,Beautiful - Go earlier in day if from D.L Bliss ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Started my hike from D.L. Bliss. I took the lighthouse trail around to the Rubicon trail, then to Vikingsholm and then to lower Eagle Falls. Then all the way back. Took me 6 hours with a couple stops and my fitness watch registered 12.75 miles (this includes the 1-2 mi walk each way from parking on the main road to the trailhead, since the park is still closed and I couldn’t park inside) "
Rubicon Trail,5.0,Amazing Views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Must go early in busy Summer season, before 9am for good parking.  Otherwise you'll be forced to park on the busy road and walk about a mile to the trail head."
Rubicon Trail,5.0,Family of 4 adults,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We dropped the younger members of the family at D.L Bliss State Park. They hiked from there to the beach at the head of Emerald Bay (3.5 miles) , called Vikingsgold. My husband and I, who are over 50, drove back around to the other end of the trail at Emerald Bay Park, and made the 1.6 mile hike to the same beach and met the ""kids."" The trail was gorgeous in both directions - the shorter trail on the East is slow and sloping. This beach is worth a visit, because of its beauty and seclusion. "
Rubicon Trail,5.0,Unspoilt wilderness,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sought out a lot of local advice on the best hikes to maximise our short trip here. Rubicon came up on most people’s recommendations of ‘must do’ hikes.
Rubicon Trail,5.0,Great hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got to Emerald Bay state park early and had no trouble parking.  The first trail we came to was the Rubicon and saw it went to the beach and Vikingsholm castle.  Walked the trail all the way down.  There were beautiful views along the way.  After being at the beach for a little bit, continued on the trail but then decided not to go too far since we needed to head back up the mountain to get back to the car.  Will tell you it was a challenge going back up being from Texas and not used to the altitude. But you can’t beat the views. Also off the trail you can get to Lower Eagle Falls which was very pretty."
Hermit Trail,4.5,A perfect day hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My sister and I were very lucky with the cooler temperatures. We took the shuttle out to Hermit's Rest and hiked back to the Grand Canyon Lodge. The total distance traveled for this hike was around 8 miles.
Hermit Trail,4.5,good and moderate/ best sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,did the sunset hike. trail has great views and not too difficult. moderate rating and moderate grade. 
Hermit Trail,4.5,Long walk but do it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail is about 9 miles but excellent to walk. Because the elevation is not too big it's very reasonable to do. For about 6 miles you will follow the path which is continue near the Canyon with great views. Start early in the morning while it can become quite warm. 
Hermit Trail,4.5,Difficult Trail,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Was not well marked and we are not experienced hikers so we turned around quick. The next day we asked a park ranger and he called this a transitional trail - you almost need topographical maps. I would only advise this trail for experienced hikers. 
Hermit Trail,4.5,Less crowded ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This place was less crowded than all the other stops on the south rim. Interesting to learn that the man wasn’t a hermit at all and loved having guests .. great views. Bring water or fill water here too.

Hermit Trail,4.5,The beaten trail is not for hermits,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since 1987, i have visited Grand Canyon for each season of the year, more during summer and twice in Winter. The Hermit's Trail and the Angel lodge  house have been my staple trail and lodging area, with the latter providing a fireplace that kept visitors warm.  Now the Hermit's Trail is perhaps one the most traversed because of the view it presents to the visitors and guests. A not-to-miss place."
Hermit Trail,4.5,Hermits Trail is a fine way to explore the South Rim,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hermit’s Trail is a fine way to explore the South Rim. The tram will pick you up if you become tired. Any reason to explore the Grand Canyon is great. The Bright Angel Trail is more tiring and requires endurance. The Hermit Trail requires less endurance.
Hermit Trail,4.5,Go there!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is well worth the moderately easy trek...it is a unique piece of history and is the vision of an incredible woman, architect Mary Colter (around 1914), who captured the spirit of the Canyon and its natural beauty.  Like the Canyon itself, you just don't want to leave the experience of Hermit's Rest."
Hermit Trail,4.5,What a great day at The Grand Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented bikes at the visitor center.  We rented them for 5 hour package which gave us time to take the 21 mile trip to Hermit Pass.  There are many awesome places to view the Canyon along the trail.  Our small children struggled with the hills.  My wife took our young girls back on the bus which have bike racks on them. My son and I completed the whole route. My legs felt like wet noodles for 2 days. FYI, I did not prepare for the elevation and distance of the ride.  I would do this again."
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,Not Easy but Worth It,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The view at the Lake Michigan end is spectacular once you get there.  North Manitou Island is visible, and the atmosphere is peaceful.  Fair warning: the dune has no barriers and can be intimidating for anyone afraid of heights.  The trail to the scenic overlook is mostly wooded and hard-packed sand/dirt.  The problem is that it is 0.6 miles all uphill, not good if you are out of shape.  The good news is that the walk back to the car is all downhill after you've enjoyed the scenery.  Good for kids?  Mine liked it, others might not like the uphill battle.  Overall, most hikes in Michigan are less strenuous but don't have this payoff view at the terminus."
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,Picturesque ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Truly a magnificent view of Lake Michigan. Short easy hike to get up to a view of Lake Michigan. Here the water is gorgeous and the views are picturesque. A shorter hike than some other dunes to get to a bluff with good views, however there is a trail and lots of people wear shoes to make it easier. It is not all sandy and the trails are gravel. Half of our group made another small hike to get to the dunes that form a bowl. This takes you through the trees and there are several trails that take you to the dunes. Our first time we were not sure which one to take, but I think all of them take you to the same spot. Just ask someone and they will point you in the right direction. That you can run down and get back out of. Definitely worth going here at least once. We will go again. "
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,Short enough for a toddler ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are visiting with our 1.5 year old. We are new to toddler traveling so we weren't too sure about the hike. It's very short so we just carried our little one most of the way, but certainly doable with a jogging stroller. It's steep at times but again very short. The view is stunning. The entire trip takes about 45 minutes including time for viewing and is definitely worth it! "
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,Short and Sweet,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I really enjoyed this trail! You can get to the lookout with a short hike, but you can also make it a longer hike through the dunes. The trail was well maintained, and there was lots of good signs. Overall a great afternoon."
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,Steep but worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My husband and I were traveling around Lake Michigan.  We took this hike while visiting Sleeping Bear Dunes.  It is a short hike.  Only six tenths of a mile each way.  However it is steep.  We are late 50’s in average condition.  We made it with no issues.  We just took several breaks.  The views at the end are worth it.
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,Amazing place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is 15 min drive north of Glen Arbor. Short hike, gets a bit steep at the end. The views are worth it. If you have time, also take the trail to the ""meadows"". Half way, you will see a very dune which many people climb. It is a very steep climb, but the views are even better than the official pyramid point. "
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,"OK, but skip if you have limited time in Sleeping Bear Dunes",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hike to Pyramid Point is nothing memorable.  The view at the end is great, but there are much better overlooks of Lake Michigan elsewhere in Sleeping Bear Dunes.  If you only have one day, skip this one.  If you have two or more days, do it."
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,Recommended Sleeping Bear Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail takes you to the northernmost point of the park land. It's a bit of a drive from the more-frequently traveled trails in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Forest, but worth the time and effort--especially if you'd rather avoid crowds. "
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,Great views and a nice hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Decided to take my girlfriend on a Sunday morning hike with a secret plan set for the top.  We took the long way around the trail that was about 2.5 miles.  The trail itself is mostly woodsy, however once you get to the overlook (can skip the hike and it's about .6 miles from the parking area), it is absolutely worthwhile.  A little hilly that will give some exercise.  Dropped to one knee at the top and proposed!  My brother in law hid in some bushes and captured BEAUTIFUL photos we will cherish for many years to come."
Pyramid Point Trail,4.5,"Better than the dunes, outstanding panoramic views!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"In comparison to the dunes this was a much better trail. The path is shorter, easier (a lot of shadows) and the view of lake Michigan is quite more beautiful. Easier to do with young kids!"
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Simply beautiful trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This short trail is what they call “self interpretive” - basically there are helpful information boards all along this 1/2 mile trail explaining how the forest maintains itself and it’s eco-system. Really informative, fun  and easy trail. I’d recommend it to any skill level as the ground is even and the “climbs” are gentle slopes. "
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Beautiful Rainforest Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the Quinault Rain Forest Nature Trail and connecting trails while visiting the area.  It's a really beautiful hike with giant trees draped in moss and cascading creeks.  The loop trail is under a mile and has interpretive signs.  It connects with Quinault Trail to make a longer hike.  Willaby Creek Falls is just downstream of the road and there are several other waterfalls along the trail and a section along the lakeshore.  Overall, a really great rainforest hike that is somewhat less crowded than Hoh Rainforest."
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Great exercise and walk in the woods,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed just over 5 miles of trail hikes doing a nice loop from Lake Quinault Lodge past a couple of waterfalls and experiencing the various trees, nature, cedar bog, and streams.  The trails were well marked and the map provided by the lodge was accurate.  The trail is well maintained with bridges, wooden paths through the bog, guardrails where necessary, and great explanations and views along the way.  Look for bald eagle nests, large slugs, elk, and other nature/wildlife along the trail."
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Perfect Place to Start your Quinault Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Shortly after entering the Quinault area on South Shore Road, you'll see the turnout for a parking lot that will take you to the Rain Forest Nature Trail loop, the first of several loops possible in the area. But the Rain Forest trail, a short half-mile walk, is a great introduction to the wonders of the rainforest. It is well-signed with explanatory text on what trees you are seeing, the other fauna and flora in the forest, the age of the trees, the importance of fallen trees, and lots of other interesting facts. Take the time to stop and read them on your stroll and soak in the beauty: you are forest bathing!"
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Not flat!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail wasn't as easy as I thought as there's some elevation and parts that are rocky. There was a big step that is hard for weak knees. However, the scenery and stream were beautiful. As a nature trail, there are informative signs. No part of this is wheelchair accessible. Half-mile loop that shouldn't be missed!"
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Lovely trail ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great way to see the rain forest   Unique area. Easy trail. The air is so fresh and 
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Beautiful walk into prehistoric rainforest -- steps from the road!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The rain forest trail is one of several things on the Lake Quinault loop drive. As you exit on South Shore, it's an easy stop off to the right. "
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,An Outstanding & Easy Rainforest Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trailhead for this easy but outstanding 0.5 mile (0.8k) loop trail is from a large parking area, which has potable water and restrooms with flush toilets, on South Shore Road along Lake Quinault, 1.4 miles (2.3k) east of its junction with Hwy 101.  Note that this area is under the jurisdiction of the US Forest Service and is a “fee area” so even if you have paid to enter Olympic National Park, you will need to get a $5 Forest Service day pass, available onsite, to display in your car while parked unless you have an annual interagency pass displayed which is honored here.  When we returned from the hike, we noticed a Forest Service ranger placing violations on vehicles that were not displaying a valid pass."
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Easy and pretty trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We enjoyed hiking the Rain Forest Nature Trail. The scenery was beautiful and we saw some small animals. It was an easy hike and I would recommend it.
Rain Forest Nature Trail,4.5,Serene and Peaceful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful nature trail that gives you a taste of the rain forests located in the Olympic peninsula. It's filled with moss, ferns, old growth pines, and peacefulness that satisfies the soul."
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,Herman Melville home has interest for all,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a destination that has interest for many people.  The property is owned by the Berkshire Historical Society, and so there are extra exhibits that reveal the history of the area.  The house itself is a great window into the challenging life of a famous writer.  The grounds have beautiful landscaping, plus scenic nature trails."
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,Exceptional tour,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"On a beautiful October afternoon my husband and I visited this wonderful home. As most everyone has commented, we were not disappointed. Our docent fellow, a self professed Melville Fanatic of sorts. He captivated our attention with the wonderful stories which were Melville’s life. A must visit in the Berkshires!"
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,Thar she blows!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I showed up at Arrowhead in late afternoon on a beautiful autumn day, and I was the only person on my particular ""tour."" Which, during these viral times, was a boon. The history of the house (and barn and grounds) is so interesting. As some other visitor said in his/her review, much of the furnishings is not original, but it IS of the period, so the vibe is very good. And frankly, just being able to stand there in the room where Melville wrote ""Moby-Dick"" and look out the window he looked out ... that was plenty enough for me! Lovely staff, nice little gift shop ... and a very evocative visit for literary history folks."
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,A nice visit for a Melville fan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There's not too much to the house, and of what is there, not much is original.  However, if you're a fan, it's a good place to visit, and especially to see the view of Greylock from his writing desk.  You get a nice overview of his life.  The grounds are lovely, but I found a tick on me after a very quick step onto the meadows, so beware.  We spent about an hour there, plenty of parking.  On a Saturday morning we were the only ones on the tour.  If you're not a Melville fan, I'd remove a star from the rating."
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,A must-see in the Berkshires!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited Arrowhead over Memorial Day weekend in 2007.  We really enjoyed the tour ($15/adults) although you are not allowed to take pictures inside the house.  I never read Moby Dick but still found the tour to be very interesting.  I would recommend it to anyone into literature or history.  We would have loved to venture to the top of Mt. Greylock but the public road system is closed for construction and set to reopen in 2009.  At 3,491 feet, Mount Greylock is the highest point in Massachusetts.  Trails are open so you could always hike to the top."
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,Disappointing visit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We expected the home of Herman Melville and the Berkshire Historical Society to have more information about the history of the region when Melville lived there and the tour guide to know something about MobyDick. But the earnest young tour guide admitted he had not read the book and was dreading doing so when he returned to school in the fall. He knew very little about the literary life of Melville focusing more on a possible affair with a neighbor, and the furniture in the home. The lack of a kitchen in the house was never adequately explained nor any details about Melville's life when he was writing except that he stayed in  his room for hours and ate dinner alone. The young man 's vocabulary and grammar would have made his English teacher wince.  "
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,Uninformed Guided Tour,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was disappointed in our visit to Arrowhead. I'm from the Berkshires and have been meaning to visit Herman Melville's house for years. I'm also passionate about historic homes and particularly, the authors or intellectuals who lived in them. I've visited the Emily Dickinson house in Amherst, Edna St. Vincent Millay's home in NY state, Olana outside Hudson, etc. and Arrowhead was easily the most disappointing. Our young tour guide seemed interested, but uninformed. Her tour lacked a linear structure so while the stories were moving, they were as interesting as they were impossible to follow. We're happy to pay $15 (or more...) for a guided tour of Arrowhead, but we also expect the management to provide a professional, informative, and well paced narrative experience."
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,Literary pilgrimage,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you care about Moby Dick at all, come visit the house where Melville wrote it. The tour give Melville’s biography, including a description of his wild whaling years, and then you go through his modest, charming home, including the guest room where Nathaniel Hawthorne slept, and the desk on which Moby Dick was written, looking out into Mount Greylock. There is a pretty, easy trail out back, and a barn housing temporary exhibitions. This past year they did a read along of Moby Dick for Melville’s birthday, which was surprisingly fun. The gift shop was editions of Melville’s works, biographies, criticism, and “what would Queequeg do?” shirts. You can combine Arrowhead with Edith Wharton’s The Mount Down the road for a day of idyllic literary havens."
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,An Unexpected Gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We found our tour of Arrowhead to be an unexpectedly rewarding experience. Reading the reviews of those who have visited before, however, it looks like not everyone found it so. The extent to which people enjoyed their tour seems to depend largely on the talents of whichever tour guide they drew. Well, our guide, Francine, was excellent. In our years of retirement we have toured many Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century houses, and she pointed out some architectural aspects of this type of dwelling which had never been explained to us before. She also delivered her information with just the right blend of humor and enlightenment."
Herman Melville's Arrowhead,4.5,"If you're a hardcore fan, visit!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"As a local, I drive by this house several times a month. I've visited this museum several times. It's a nice little museum if you're a huge fan of Melville...the rooms are decorated with period furniture, and you can get a sense of his inspiration from the surrounding Berkshire Hills. This is a quick place to visit, you can see everything in less than an hour.  He's an important American author, but honestly, once was enough for me. I suppose I'm not that into Melville, but I find it a little boring. My first visit here was as a kid, and I felt so privileged to visit this home, and I still remember it.  As an adult, meh. I'm just not that into it.  The guides are great and they work hard to bring him to life.  It's just not my thing I guess."
Prescott Peavine National Recreation Trail,4.5,What's going on with all the pay-stations?,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"These trails have been around Prescott for the last 100 years, now all of a sudden the city comes in, paves a parking lot, and starts charging $5.

Prescott Peavine National Recreation Trail,4.5,Nice Walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I had a nice walk on the Peavine Trail in mid-October.  We started at the south end and walked north.  Very scenic after you get about a half mile or so in.  A good address to enter into your GPS for the parking lot at the south end is 1625 Sundog Ranch Road, Prescott, AZ 86301.  That will put you right across the street."
Prescott Peavine National Recreation Trail,4.5,Great 3 - 6 miles Walk in Prescott,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Whether you are up for a 3 mile or 6 mile walk you can't go wrong on the Peavine Trail.  Sometimes I just walk out 1.5 miles to see a beautiful view of the Lake and then walk back. Other days I walk to Point of Rocks (3 miles out, 3 miles back).  Whether a short or long walk, I'm never disappointed and often see Great Blue Herons along with other birds."
Prescott Peavine National Recreation Trail,4.5,Easy walk with water and rock formations.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did the hike or rather walk from the trailhead at Sundog Ranch Rd. There is a spacious paved parking area here. There is a $2.00/vehicle charge to park here. There are also bathrooms here with no other bathrooms along this 5.5 mile trail. 
Prescott Peavine National Recreation Trail,4.5,An amazing place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The peavine trail starts in a fairly industrial area, but don't give up.  It passes by the edge of Watson lake, with great views toward Granite Mountain, and then leads into the Dells, where there are many wonderful side trails - a little piece of quiet heaven, right here in tow."
Prescott Peavine National Recreation Trail,4.5,"Walk, Run or Bike It!  Get there and experience it!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"THIS is Prescott!  Make your way along the trail to Watson Lake then continue to Point of Rocks and beyond.  Movies have been made here, a railroad used to run through here, cattle roamed.  Wander through granite formations found no where else on the planet.  You will see walkers, hikers, bicyclists and horseback riders.  This place represents Prescottonians love of the outdoors, it is quintessential Prescott."
Prescott Peavine National Recreation Trail,4.5,A great trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed walking this easy to walk trail. The scenery was simply amazing. We came in at the parking lot entrance, which is on the southerly side. You do have to pay $2.00 but I sure thought it was worth it. Tripadvisor sends you to the northerly end and I found that a bit confusing for parking as I didn't want to just park on the side of the road. Spend the $2.00 and park in the parking lot. That location is just off of Sundog Ranch Rd, which is off of Prescott Lakes Pkwy. (Take highway 89 to Prescott Lakes Prkwy head southeast to Sundog Ranch Rd head northeast) You will see the Yavapai Humane Society building on the corner. I can't wait to come back as there were many trails to walk."

Prescott Peavine National Recreation Trail,4.5,Great bike ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I live next to this trail.  It is dirt, ok for mountain bikes or hiking, no road bikes.   From the 89A trailhead, it is about six miles to the animal shelter, the end of the trail, with water and restrooms.  You see Watson Lake on the way, beautiful and the Granite Dells are a smaller Sedona.  There are rattlesnakes, other critters, so be careful, but a beautiful ride.  There is a wide mix of users, from World Class mountain bikers, old folks hiking and casual bikers, so be careful.  There is one road with automobile traffic.  If you have an hour, this is a great way to exercise and see some great spots."

Charlies Bunion,5.0,Much better hikes in the park for the effort,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are in our 50s/60s and experienced hikers. Though most sources rate this trail as ""moderate"" we rate it ""hard/strenuous"". We think it's harder than Alum Cave to Mt LeConte. Once we got to Charlies Bunion on a Monday afternoon it was crowded so we did not get to enjoy the view; too many people. The Ice Water Spring shelter was great to stop and have lunch and/or just take a break. Got to chat with many others at the shelter and with a couple people staying the night (we did not spend the night). The trailhead is one of the few with ""lots"" of parking so getting there at 10:45am we had no problem getting a parking spot; can't say that for most trailheads. If you have nothing else to do or all other trailheads are full, and you want a hard hike 8 miles RT, it's worth a try."
Charlies Bunion,5.0,Worth the hike...,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hike which takes place on a portion of the Appalachian trail. We went at a decent pace & it took under 4 hours total with time to sit & enjoy the view. Portions of the trail are on an incline & traverse a wet creek bed. The view includes alot of evergreens so there was not much color but is still a great panoramic view. There is a restroom at the trailhead. Get to the parking lot early as it is a popular lookout point. 
Charlies Bunion,5.0,"Moderate hike, beautiful views",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"three families.....3 kids ~9, 5 adults 43 - 57.     overall a moderate hike.  some elevation gain to deal with and the weather can be warm.  scenery spectacular.  there is a rustic shelter on the way you can book if needed."
Charlies Bunion,5.0,Great Hike! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The view at the top was well worth the 2.5 hours hike up. Trail was well marked. Surprisingly good cell service along most of trail too lol.  We even saw a bear on our way back down. I’m a pretty active person but I don’t hike often and this was maybe 6/10 difficulty. Maybe not the easiest hike for a beginner or small kids. 
Charlies Bunion,5.0,Challenging,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Challenging hike to this great lookout point. Definitely worth the time and energy. Do yourself a favor and buy some nice hiking boots and socks. We passed so many people sitting on the side of the trail with their shoes off and nursing their blisters. Overall we loved the terrain and the beautiful scenery.
Charlies Bunion,5.0,If You Are A Senior - Don't Be Afraid Of This Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Let me start by saying I am 73 and my wife is 68.  We do hike every week, but had not done an 8 miler before.  This is a great and also challenging hike, but worth every step of the way.  We watched several You Tube videos of this hike and I do want to warn you that they do not do the elevation change justice.  Charlie's Bunion is not the highest point on the hike - the first 2.3 miles of the hike are mostly uphill with constant roots and rocks, but no hand and feet scrambling required.  The balance of the hike after passing Ice Water Springs is mostly downhill to Charlie's Bunion. Of course this means you have to go back up hill on the return trip.  When you reach ""The Bunion"" the views are fantastic and you will be glad you made the effort.  There is an elevation change of 1640 feet on this hike, it is 8.1 miles long and rated as a 11.38 difficulty rating.  We were tired when we got back to the car, but it was a hike we will always remember.  Go For It - if we can do it - you can too!!!"
Charlies Bunion,5.0,...and the views???  Stunning!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Charlies Bunion has one of the most beautiful views anywhere in the Smokies.  I first hiked this trail when I was only 10 years old.  All I remembered was we hiked a long distance (and a long time) and the destination was nice.
Charlies Bunion,5.0,"Jaw, meet floor.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"From the popular tourist stop Newfound Gap, you are a four mile (eight mile roundtrip) moderate-to-strenuous hike along the historic Appalachian Trail to views that will quite simply take your breath away.  Comparably speaking to say the Mt. Cammerer hike, this one is much less strenuous but it is definitely a strong cardio workout."
Charlies Bunion,5.0,Great hike on the AT,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked to the bunion in mid July. It was a really nice hike. The views from the bunion are spectacular. If you are afraid of heights be aware there are some steep dropoffs that could cause some anxiety. I really enjoyed the hike and would highly recommend it. 
Charlies Bunion,5.0,Amazing Hike - Sitting on Top of the World!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I wanted a new hike since we've done many of the over-crowded touristy trails in the Smokies many times before.  The 8 miles out and back to Charlie's Bunion seemed like a bit more than I could handle (we originally planned to do 6 miles with the Jump Off point).  This was a rugged trail, it was a steady incline, and it was a fair distance.  I will point out, I am not in shape what-so-ever (though there once was an athlete in my body somewhere, who is now buried in a few layers of fat!).  I felt good on the way up, so we pushed past the Jump Off to the Bunion.  I was SO glad we did.  The trail was quiet on the way up, we really got to enjoy nature.  At the top, there were many 10-15 other people up there.  Everyone was taking in the views and enjoying lunch.  Great photo ops too!  The hike down was maybe even a bit slower for us, because I started having some soreness, but we made it!  I was sore that night, but I'd do it all over again!  I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a bit of a challenge!  To prepare, make sure to bring layers.  The air is cooler up there and it's mostly shaded due to dense trees, so we were always cool and comfortable when the temp was over 80-degrees in Gatlinburg.  Also, prepare for rain, as clouds and storms can move in quickly.  Bring lots of water and a lunch!  Hiking boots will help support your ankle and cushion the bottom of your foot which does a lot more grasping and stretching over the rugged terrain than you would think.  And, there are bathrooms at the trailhead at Newfound Gap."
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,Park still charging full fee but all cliff dwellings shut down ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The park is charging full fee to get in, while all the cliff dwellings are closed off. Would be nice to at least take small groups in for tours. We are now traveling throughout Zion & Moab-arches...while a lot of things are closed they are not charging a collection fee. Mesa Verde is an awesome experience-bummed we didn’t get to see any of it. "
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,Awesome Loop Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was a great day visiting Mesa Verde. The Petroglyph Loop Trail, about 3 mi., is very cool & followed an ancient foot path along the edge of the canyon cliff, passes by a small cliff dwelling & then to the panel of glyphs & then just a little farther there are steps up to the top of the cliff & then an easy walk back. If you want an easier version, you can make a left turn at Spruce Tree House & walk along the top till you get to the stairs down to the glyphs but they are a bit steep. The canyon views along the way are breathtaking!"
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,"Terrific Trail, Awesome Views!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I are so happy we elected to complete the Petroglyph Point Hike during our visit to Mesa Verde.  Although there are longer trail hikes available, this is a fun, challenging, and very rewarding hike!  The views along the trail are tremendous and the petroglyph panel was extremely interesting."
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,Stop and soak in the scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views alone give this hike an excellent rating.  The hike is mostly on narrow trail, with lots of big rocks, and you have to pay attention despite the magnificent scenery distracting you.  Bring water (and your camera).  You really do have to scramble up rocks to reach the return trail, although, again the view from the top is rewarding.  Also, the return trail is much easier, flatter, etc.  You get a close up view of the rock carvings, and they are easy to view (not in a dark cave or anything like that)."
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,Best Trail in Mesa Verde NP,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You come to Mesa Verde for the ruins, but this park has  some great hikes.  Consensus in our group was this is the BEST hike in Mesa Verde and maybe the best of our trip to Colorado, definitely top 3.  "
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,The kids loved the hike and the interesting facts,5.0 of 5 bubbles,At first the kids were worried that we would drive all day and just look at things- Quickly they found that we were hiking literally all day and they loved it. We downloaded the Mesa Verde app that could tell us all about what we were seeing. Amazing to go back in time
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,Not for the super casual hikers but worth it.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Strenuous trail but petroglyphs are amazing.  Has a portion that is pretty tough and not a place you want your hand full of stuff.  Take water as you get a unexposed part most of midday.  Interlinks so you cn do a circle around big ruins and see some views only in shape hikers are going to get.  Best hike in park for us will make this top priority if we go back.
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,Wonderful hike! Hats off to the NPS workers!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike took us about 2 to 3 hours. It starts at Spruce Tree House, and makes a loop. We evidently went ""the wrong way"", and did it clockwise, while it's supposed to be done counterclockwise, but no one really seemed to mind. Some tough spots, but not too tough at all. The NPS folks did an INCREDIBLE job of creating ""steps"", carved right out of the existing rocks in most instances. Very very very cool. You're in the shade some and in the sun - be sure to take water! Enjoy the beauty and history, and get in some good exercise! We saw older folks (70s? maybe early 80s?) and kids (youngest was probably 5 or so, I would NOT take a child younger than 4!)."
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,Well Worth The Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We are from Florida and this was the first time my two boys (11 & 7) had gone on any type of hiking.  We originally were just going to see the cliff dwellings but when they saw the sign for the hike they were adamant about going.  The bottom half of the hike is absolutely beautiful.  It is mostly shaded and the trail is not flat.  There were plenty of rocks to climb and a couple of narrow points between rocks to get through.  Before making the climb up you have to climb a very large rock which was about three foot or more with nothing to hold onto.  Thankfully there was a young man that had passed us and stayed to give me a lift.  The climb up was strenuous for us but beautiful which helped take our minds off of the workout.  We got to the top which was flat but directly in the sun.  The views from the top are breath taking.  Head others warnings and take PLENTY of water.  If we ever get back up here I will definitely do this again.
Petroglyph Point Hike,4.5,"First Thing You Should Know:  It's Definitely NOT ""Flat""!!!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail begins at the Museum and splinters off from the Spruce Tree House trail, continuing below the edge of the plateau to a petroglyph panel, and then climbs to the top of the mesa.  In addition to the petroglyphs, there are some great views of Spruce and Navajo Canyons.  The trail is fairly well marked with 34 numbered points of interest which are described in the 50-cent trail guide."
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,Great Views worth the work to get to the top,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So this is a strenuous hike but very manageable if you take your time on the uphill part. The trail itself is beautiful and well marked. We arrived early and were able to park in the parking lot. The parking lot is on the smallish side however there is parking along the road leading to the trail. The road going to the trailhead is unpaved and has some large ruts,etc. The views are very pretty from the top and well worth a visit. I would recommend shoes with good grip due to the few sections that require climbing over rock,etc. We took our small dog ( 15lbs) with us and he only needed carried over a few places. On the way down we did pass a lot of people coming up the trail and there were a few sections that required you to wait until others passed. I would definitely arrive early."
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,The #1 Hike in Georgia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Per AllTrails, this hike is the #1 hike in the State of Georgia.  At 4.1 miles round trip and 1,453 vertical feet is it a great hike with just enough elevation in just enough distance.  While the nearly the entire hike is through a thick Georgia deciduous forest, one side of the top has a sheer granite wall that provides incredible views to the west over the valley below.  For all these reasons, this is an incredible hike.  I will say there are a number of camps in the area so the trail can be quite busy.  However, it can equally clear out as it did before I returned, hiking the entire way down by myself and having an incredible experience with a number of deer on the return. "
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,Epic hike to one of the prominent peaks in Georgia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We used to drive up to the top of Yonah back in college in the 90's when the Army was not doing training exercises.  The road to the top was very narrow somewhat dangerous.  Wisely the state of Georgia closed off this road and made a hiking trailhead.  The hike up says 2.2 miles but we ended up hiking about 2.6 up.  I guess because we hiked around the summit and cliffside quite a bit.  It's 1600 feet of elevation gain in 2.2 miles which is pretty tough.  Still I think Blood Mountain is 2000+ in 1.5 miles so not quite as much elevation change.  The trail doesn't switch back to much and has quite a bit of erosion making a few difficult footing sections.  Still I would not call in an extremely hard hike if you take it slow.  There is a really nice lookout just over halfway.  The last .75 miles is probably the toughest but you are rewarded with outstanding views of Blood Mt, Brasstown Bald and most of North Central GA.  There are some really dangerous ledges so be careful.  The trail is heavily traveled so you don't have to worry about being isolated on weekends.  There are basic bathroom facilities at the trailhead.  Definitely going to get back up here again soon and hike it again."
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,"Great Views, but Thought I was Gonna Die",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Okay, let me start by saying that Mt. Yonah and I had quite the interesting experience together. As a person who does not hike regularly, this hike was pretty strenuous. The 2,000 ft increase in just two miles definitely took the wind out of me, but the hike was incredible. The views were some of the best I had ever seen and I would do this hike again. With lookouts along the trail up the mountain, my friend and I were able to take sufficient breaks to make our climb easier. While this hike was a feat for us, we did see hikers climb this mountain with ease and were lapped by individuals who brought little water and snacks. It seems to be a hot spot for local, seasoned hikers."
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,Breathtaking. Wow.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As a former hiker gone soft, this was a difficult hike and much willpower was needed to finish. The 1450’ elevation gain is no joke. The rock and boulder path was tough. When I reached the Army training camp, I knew I had been too ambitious but couldn’t turn back by then. If the military trains on a mountain, one knows it will be full of suck. The view at the summit was gorgeous. A man and a child were fairly close and the child, while polite, talked loudly the entire time. So much for zen. The hike down went more quickly but was brutal. The hike difficulty was mostly due to my fitness level or lack thereof. It was worth it."
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,Mt Yonah day trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was a very strenuous hike, very steep. But my whole fam still loved it! Walk, yes! But to run is a huge no, the mountain was super steep and I wouldn’t want to roll an ankle. Still a fun trip though!!!!"
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,Beautiful Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is about a 4.5 mile hike to the top of Yonah Mountain. The path is clear but has roots and some rocks. At the halfway point up the mountain, there is a grassy clearing for your first good view. After that, the path gets much steeper. At the top, there are many outcrops you can sit and enjoy views. It was a little hard finding the trailhead, but the parking lot is on a short gravel road off Chambers road. No fee to park and pit toilets. I would say this hike is moderate to strenuous, but very doable. Take lots of water."
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,Great hike. Beautiful views! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Tough hike, but we didn’t bring water and were fine. Only just over 2 miles to the top but very steep! 1,400 ft in elevation gain. My kids (8 & 11) loved the challenge! Might bring water next time, but it was also nice not to carry anything. Cool Native American history (and army ranger training) to this mountain of you google it. "
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,Unbelievable,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Was definitely a difficult hike compared to the average hikes I’ve done and also what I thought the hike was gonna be. BUT the best view point I’ve ever been too. Even better then baldtown brass. Yonah has the hiking challenge with a reward once you get to the top
Yonah Mountain Hiking Trail,4.5,Strenuous but scenic hike...Great day trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I actually went 2 times in the same week. The first time I went with a group of adults and had a blast. Several adults actually struggled with the 2.5 mile hike up the mountain. Some sections of the trail are very steep and narrow. You do have to climb a few boulders that block the trail, so be sure you have shoes with traction. It took us 1.5 hours to hike it as a group at a consistent pace and a few brief rest stops. Take at least 30 oz of water per person. It should last the entire hike up and down. Possibly more water needed for summer hikes. "
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,Lovely first hike in Denali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived at Denali late on a beautiful June afternoon and wanted to squeeze in a quick hike.  Horseshoe Lake Trail was a lovely introduction to the park.  The view from the top of the hill before you descend the steps toward the lake is stunning.  We loved seeing the beaver dam and getting to walk along the Nenana river.  It wasn't all that crowded when we hiked, and it was a great way to spend an hour or two."
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,Beaver Paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a great hike for the legs.  We counted over 300 stairs but it’s well worth the calorie burn.  When you reach the lake make sure you turn down the short path to the beaver dam.  It’s amazing what they have built.  When you go back up the hill check out the fallen trees around you.  It’s hard to belief how many trees the beavers have taken down.  I thought this hike was one of the most beautiful ones that we walked in the park. Enjoy!
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,Great short hike in Denali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This hike leaves from the visitor center and is a 4 mile loop. The change in elevation is not great and the path is very easy to walk. The lake is lovely and when we were there there was a beaver dam and we saw the beaver. It was really beautiful and I would recommend doing this hike if you have time when you visit Denali.
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,"Good, not Great",4.0 of 5 bubbles,We were told that moose had been seen on this trail recently but I doubt it.  Pretty busy trail because it's conveniently located to the Visitor Center but that probably discourages the wild life.  A pretty walk in a great place but that's about it.  Better to go into the park if determined to see wildlife (although there is an amazing beaver lodge on the lake)
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,Lovely walk near the Visitor Center,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice walk to take on a sunny day.  You descend many stairs to reach the lake level and, of course, have to climb back up those stairs at the end.  Otherwise, the trail is relatively flat.  You can take a spur to see a beaver dam.  It is a very scenic walk."
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,Fabulous trail if you are comfortable with 300 stair steps down and 300 up on the way back.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a beautiful trail both morning and evening with spectacular views over the small lake, moose and beaver sightings and really accessible to anyone who is comfortable with 300 steps up and 300 steps down. Easily completed in 45 minutes, easy to find, parking right near the trailhead or a short walk from the Denali Visitor Center. Highly recommend this as a first stop in Denali to whet your appetite!"
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,"Nice, easy hike if you're fine with stairs!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I really liked this hike! It doesn't give you any view of the mountains or Denali, but it's a beautiful lake loop that is nice if you have an extra hour or two. Steps at the beginning/end but otherwise pretty easy. Some benches and shoreline places you could sit on rocks or the ground for a picnic."
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,Pure Phot Worthy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an easy lollipop trail around Horseshoe Lake.

You will truly enjoy this hike.
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,Huge Beaver Dams,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a lovely trail. It is easy to hike and easy to follow. You get beautiful views of the lake, the Nenana River, and especially the hug beaver dams. All around are trees showing they have been cut down by beavers. "
Horseshoe Lake Trail,4.5,Nice and pretty easy hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike with our 15 month old. It was pretty easy. The only harder part was towards the end for us when there was an incline. There are nice views of mountains, trees and water throughout the hike. And the main lake has a pretty color even when it’s cloudy. We came here towards the end of August so it was a cloudy day with a very slight drizzle but didn’t feel cold. We still enjoyed ourselves and the hike. We didn’t see any beavers at the dam."
Withlacoochee State Trail,4.5,Pleasant but monotonous,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rode an 18 mile section of this trail to Ferris Groves in Floral City, where we got to enjoy milkshakes, and made a stop by the overlook on the Withlacoochee river."
Withlacoochee State Trail,4.5,Beautiful Rail/Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The 46-mile Withlacoochee State Trail is a great place to ride.  The surface is asphalt paved and the trail winds through or near several small towns as well as through the City of Inverness.  Much of the trail is through forest with a lovely, shady canopy."
Withlacoochee State Trail,4.5,"Easy riding, great views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I rode the entire trail in two days. Day 1 we went north from the Central Motel in Inverness to the the end of the trail at mile marker 46, turned around and headed south to mile marker 23 in Floral City then headed back to our motel (47 miles) round trip. There are a few trail heads with Bathroom facilities and right off the trail plenty of places to stop for refreshments. Day 2 we parked our car in Floral City at mile marker 23 and headed south to the beginning of the trail. The southern half of the trail is a little more remote taking you through the Withlacoochee forest. The trailheads are further apart and there is no where right on the trail to purchase refreshments. However we did find a CITGO Station on Trilby RD just a few doors down from the Trilby Post Office approximately 3 miles from mile marker 0. The CITGO Station has a large variety of sports drinks and high energy snacks if you are low on drinks or need a protein boost this is a good place to stop and only a short distance off the trail. We did 46 miles round trip on day 2  and we’re glad we booked an extra night at the Central Motel so we could rest and shower before heading to our next destination."
Withlacoochee State Trail,4.5,"Inverness, Fl - A great place to play and be",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rented two trikes (from Trek Bicycles in Inverness) to ride this trail, and it was well worth it. So many places to see and places to eat along the trail. One of our favorites was Ferris Grove. Great strawberry shakes and shortcakes. Fresh veggies and fruit, and many jams (which we did send a number home). Also, Burger Station is a place to have lunch. Trail is well kept, flat, and paved.  When needing to cross a road, cars stop to let us cross. Just make sure they see you and are prepared to stop. Be as courteous as the drivers are. All other bikers and walkers were very pleasant. This was a must do experience if in Inverness. Also, be sure to do some kayaking in Rainbow River)."
Withlacoochee State Trail,4.5,Loved it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great biking surface.  Lots of shade (going south from Inverness).  Floral City is 7 miles south and is a great place to stop for lunch (Shamrock Inn recommended) on the way back from any length ride.

There are restrooms along the way which was appreciated."

Withlacoochee State Trail,4.5,Beautiful and excellent bike path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I rod this bike path on a sunny February day. The canal/river on one side provided excellent scenery.

It was a very pleasant ride, and all free!"
Withlacoochee State Trail,4.5,Uneventful Ride,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Starting from the Central Hotel in Inverness, we rode approx. 20 miles south on the trail before turning back. During a Thursday in November, parts of the ride had a mixture of riders, joggers and dog walkers, all quite friendly with most of the ride, easy going and solitary with long stretches of native flora. There was very little in the way of wildlife apart from the multitude of Gopher Turtle whose dens were quite fascinating. A nice wide, smooth trail with little gain in elevation."

Appalachian Trail,4.5,Iconic Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did not come to Shenandoah National Park to hike the Appalachian Trail, or the AT for short, but since the trail travels the 105-mile (169k) length of the park, we were bound to hike portions of the trail which was often incorporated into the local park trails.  One can always tell when they are on the well maintained and marked Appalachian Trail by the white blazes or the stylized white AT on trail markers versus the blue blazes of the park’s trails or the yellow blazes of the horse trails.  If you are backpacking or planning an overnighter, one can find shelters and outhouses at several points along the AT within the park."
Appalachian Trail,4.5,Mistaken hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We were on our way to Hawksbill and took the wrong route. We went on Salamander Trail and I need to applaud myself. It took us 2 hours to get to the top and it was amazing and I did it. Came back down Hawksbill lower trail. Remember there are 2 different parking lots. It is not easy but definitely worth it. 
Appalachian Trail,4.5,Breathtaking...,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stepping foot on the AT was a massive bucket list tick. Due to time restraints, we only managed to get a few miles in before sunset. Just wow.

Appalachian Trail,4.5,Sweet Trail Time,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As a through hiker, I really looked forward to the 100+ mile jaunt through the ""Shennys"". The trail was well groomed, the walking was easy, and the wildlife (bears) were abundant. Not to mention the frequent Waysides and Lodges where the hungry hiker can feast. This is civilized hiking at it's finest. I highly recommend the A.T. in the Shenandoah National Park."
Appalachian Trail,4.5,AT - Lewis Mtn. Cabins to Big Meadows Lodge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This 8.6 miles section was one of the more enjoyable sections of the AT we have hiked in Georgia, N.

There are two climbs that are not very long (especially at the end to Black Rock and Big Meadows Lodge), but most of the section is fairly level or moderately rolling. Several unbelievable long-range views across the Shenandoah Valley! Would definitely do this section again without hesitation!"

The Greenway Trail,,Great trail for all levels,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a wonderfully trail.  Not too difficult with mostly smooth path. Absolutely beautiful walks and jogs with lots of off shoots from the main path.  And saw deer there every time I went. 
The Greenway Trail,,Hidden gem,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"this was a lovely surprise. I did not know this existed in Boone.  It was a little tricky to navigate, as there are a lot of paths going many ways. So maybe better signage?  I am hoping it gets extended for those long runs!"

The Greenway Trail,,Not to be missed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This beautiful resource in the middle of Boone is a mountain jewel. The trail is appropriate for walking or riding a bike.

The Greenway Trail,,It used to be awesome.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family and I have used the Greenway trail for many, many years. We rode our bikes to the park, baseball practice and even town for pizza and ice cream. It used to be our favorite way to travel freely through Boone, however now it is over run with scary and questionable people. My kids and I were walking the trail one afternoon to go play in the river when a man tried to steal my bag, we have found mattresses, blankets and mountains of trash in the woods right off the trail as well as a dirty needle laying on the path. My family and I no longer use the Greenway because the locals refuse to stop the people from camping in the woods, panhandling and creating a safety hazard. Its very unfortunate."
The Greenway Trail,,"Really disappointing greenway. Waste of time, don't bother.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"After researching some of the better things to do in Boone, We ended up trying the Greenway trail.  First of all, it is nothing more than a loop of asphalt and weeds- totally unlike it's hype.  The trail starts and stops at various confusing sections- even as small as it was, the signage was terrible.  One of the entrances was in a neighborhood I didn't feel particularly safe in and was glad my husband was with me.  The other entrance off a main road in town near a restaurant, began with a walk under a viaduct./bridge area riddled with trash and what was apparently a place where homeless or other folks looking for a hideout may gather.  Part of the trail is a walk around an industrial looking area.  Nothing scenic about this.  You won't even feel like you are in Boone.  Felt more like an economically depressed city in anywhere, USA."
The Greenway Trail,,Currently Under Construction,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very pretty trail that has paved and dirt options. Due to the current construction, there is no loop to bring you back to where you started, so you will just have to turn back the way you came. Be prepared to double your stroll! :)"
The Greenway Trail,,Boone's Greenway Trail offers a Natural Setting Near an Urban Area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Town of Boone was wise to build a greenway park system on it's property along the flood plain of the South Fork of the New River as it meanders through Boone from near the Blowing Rock Road to the eastern edge near Highway 421.  Over 2 miles in length the main paved part of the Greenway Trail is accessible to those in wheelchairs.  A couple of bridges , one covered, cross the lovely New River, which is popular with children interested in throwing rocks and anglers seeking pan fish, bass,  and even trout.  The Greenway Trail is relatively flat making it attractive to walkers, parents pushing strollers, runners, cyclists, and, in season, cross-country skiers.  Nearby unpaved trails make the greenway trail area especially popular with cross-country runners and a number of high school teams come up each year from the flat lands in late July and August  to train in the cool mountain temperatures.  Near the main parking lot a fascinating water sedimentation area designed with the help of Appalachian State University's faculty shows how urban run off can be collected to remove pollutants and to offer a habitat for birds and aquatic plants.  An old dam site marks the location of Boone's first water system. The fact the the sewage treatment plant on the northern end of the trail smells need not distract excessively from the beautiful mountain setting close to Boone's main urban shopping area along the Blowing  Rock Road.  Three parking areas offer access.  A large one at the Burney-Clawson Park is near the Watauga  Aquatic Center across from the National Guard Armory.  One smaller lot is located off Deerfield Road and offers a lovely smaller park with shaded benches.  The second  small lot is accessible off highway 421 and is a bit harder to locate.  Newcomers would be advised to approach from the Blowing Rock Rd. end.  Picnic shelters and porta johns are also available near the main parking lot at the Burney-Clawson Park.  "

Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail,5.0,Love this place!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I loved visiting Sleeping Bear.  If you can catch the right temps, you can walk barefoot on the dunes in the sand.  I was timid to do much of that because of some issues I was having, but the temps were great.  I did walk a bit barefoot in the sand, which I love.  Climb the dune!  It's fun.  If you want to go the whole trail, you need to back pack with water, plan for about 4 - 5 miles and it will take you around 3 hours.  Walking in sand the whole way is quite a challenge."

Only bad part is in Glen Arbor to Crystal River trailhead when the trail is on the road not a separate path.

Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail,5.0,EXCELLENT!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What an incredible trail! Rode north from Glen Arbor to 669 and back! Some parts were crushed stone but nothing a road bike couldn't navigate (one or two small soft spots) A couple of gentle climbs along the way. Beautiful uncrowded beach at 669. Got back at Glen Arbor, had lunch and then headed south. First four miles are relatively flat. From there, once past the sand dunes, not your typical flat rail trail. Paved the entire way. Some very nice climbs to challenge and delight. We have ridden many trails and agreed this in Numero Uno. A little over 40 miles and 1100 feet of climbing  round trip. If you're a roadie you will love this trail. We can't wait to go back and spend some time at the 669 beach, Enjoy!"
Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail,5.0,Biking Trail Review,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The brochure said it was named one of the most beautiful trails in the country. Not even close! The trail is about 20 miles one way. It is a mostly paved, moderate trail with some challenging hills. A few miles are crushed rock. Parts of the trail are actually shared roadway with vehicles. The scenery is nothing special and actually gets boring in many spots. I did the trail from beginning to end and back again. Coming back, it gets very confusing in Glen Harbor as the trail is not well marked. I actually could not find the turn and a very helpful couple assisted me in finding it. If you are just looking for a long bike trail, this will do the trick. If you would like a beautiful bike ride this is probably not it although it could possibly be quite pretty in the fall in certain areas. NOTE: You will need a national park pass to ""ride"" the trail. The cost is $10 - $20 depending on if you park a vehicle or just ride your bike."

Los Gatos Creek Trail,4.5,"Great for trail for biking, running, or walking right alongside a beautiful creek.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Los Gatos is one of the nicest towns in the entire Bay Area and the Los Gatos Creek Trail winds through the valley leading up into the heart of Los Gatos starting in the town of Campbell.  Because the trail follows the Los Gatos Creek, there is plenty of interesting things to look at along the way such as connecting parks and lakes, mountains views of the adjacent Santa Cruz mountains, and plenty of avid outdoors enthusiasts to people watch!  The grade of elevation change is slight enough so that even beginner cyclists can get to the top but there are plenty of locations with some uphills/downhills to keep you interested in the terrain and give your body a nice aerobic workout, combine with beautiful scenery and this is easily one of the best trails in all of the Bay Area!"
Los Gatos Creek Trail,4.5,"Nothing wrong with the trail, but beware of the misleading Google map directions",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"I tried to go to the trail, so I found it on my Google Map app (Samsung Galaxy Android phone, latest software) and followed its directions.  Unfortunately, there was a bug in the map.  The trail runs parallel to Highway 17, but t Google Map treated the highway like a normal street.  So at a certain point as I was going down the highway, the GPS said ""your destination is on the right.  You have arrived.""  Obviously, unless I wanted to cause an accident, I couldn't just stop and pull over to the side of the highway and go walk on the trail.  I got off the highway at the next exit, which unfortuantely was not a local street, but another highway (85).  I had only about an hour to spare and by the time I got off the next exit at Highway 85, I had already wasted 15 minutes and still didn't know how to get to the actual parking lot for the Los Gatos Creek Trail.  I basically just turned around and went back to my hotel.  "
Los Gatos Creek Trail,4.5,Great place to ride for beginners.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is where my kids learned to ride. It is friendly, flat and shaded in many places. Excellent for running because of the scenery and length."
Los Gatos Creek Trail,4.5,A natural shady walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I run my own doggie day care, so, last month on a day when it got close to 100 degrees in San Jose.  I needed to take the dogs out for a walk, so I decided to go to Vasona Park.  I had remembered that one of the trails that run to and from the park was pretty shady.  I hadn't realized just how shady and beautiful this trail was.  It winds down along the creek on Roberts Ave.  It was beautiful!!  So many trees and wildlife, it never even got hot for us and we all enjoyed the walk.  If I need to walk dogs now when it is hot - this is where I am going!!!!"
Los Gatos Creek Trail,4.5,"Great for exercise, sightseeing and other activities",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Through Campbell and Los Gatos, this trail offers lots of amenities. From Campbell Ave. traveling south you'll find a small urban park with picnic tables, basketball courts and a par course. You'll then arrive at Los Gatos Creek County Park, which offers more picnicking, an enclosed dog park,  and percolation ponds that offer great wild bird viewing. As you travel further south into Los Gatos, the trail passes through Vasona County Park and its lake, and adjacent to Vasona is Oak Meadow Park, with its wooden horse carousel and small scale Billy Jones railroad - both great for kids. Water fountains and restrooms are readily accessible at all locations."
Los Gatos Creek Trail,4.5,Freewheel under the freeway!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since moving to San Jose I cycle this trail daily. It's a fantastic amenity, right in the heart of the city. It feels very safe, lots of walkers, runners and cyclists use it.  "
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,Walk Between Towering Fins,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unfortunately, a sprained ankle and a rain shower prevented our group from hiking Park Avenue.  In many ways, Arches seems like two different parks.  You have the various arches in the back of the park and these great monoliths and towers in the front.  However, we did get to see the monoliths and towers from several of the parking lots.  I love the 3 gossips and the courthouse.  It was also great to see down the Park Avenue Trail to see how it is lined with towers on both sides to give the appearance that one is walking an urban street with skyscrapers on both sides.  Don't miss this part of the park."
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,Early Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We made this our first stop and hike. We did it early in our day, around 8:30, and benefited from shade most of the hike. It’s 1-mile one way. If you do a return from the 5th Avenue viewing area, there is a large step area to climb at the end. We also discovered the trail goes all the way through to the parking area by the courthouse. Starting from that point and returning back avoids the steep steps and gives you downhill on your return."
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,Great Views at Each End of the Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Spectacular view on both sides as you walk along Park Avenue Trail. It was hard to know the best time of day to do this as the rock formations are in the shade if you go too early or too late in the day. I ended up going around 11am. The lighting was good for photography but it was also getting pretty hot. I started at the Park Ave Trailhead. I would say the best views are right at the start from the observation area. Views of the Courtland Towers are spectacular at the end of the hike although you can also experience this area by parking near them. If you can arrange for a one way hike catching a ride at the end of the hike to drive you back to the start where you left your car, this would be ideal. As a solo hiker, I was tempted to hitch a ride but lost the nerve. I'm not sure if anyone out there has experience doing this? If I were to do again, unless I could arrange the ride back, I would probably just visit both ends and walk a short ways in and back  from each trailhead as I didn't find the middle section as interesting."
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,SENSATIONAL!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the first trail that I came across after entering the park. The hike is not particularly long as I clocked it at about 2.36 miles (3.8 km). It is considered easy to moderate due to some hills and changing terrain. This trail will take you past the gigantic monoliths, most notably The Three Gossips, The Courthouse Towers and The Organ just to name a few. You will also hike through canyons with amazing views. It will also follow along a smooth, multi colored wash that resembles poured cake mix. This is an out and back hike as opposed to a loop. With numerous stops for pictures and observation it was still under an hour. Take your map, bring water, if you carry it in carry it out and descending always yields to ascending!"
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,Quick stop on way into park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the first stops in Arches NP is the Park Avenue Viewpoint. We did not go on a hike here because we went on hikes in other locations where there were arches. There are tall colorful rocks here worth the stop in or out of the park.
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,Cityscape in rock form,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Moderate hike to stroll through park avenue in the arches. Surrounded by beautiful towering rock formations easy to see how it got it’s name. A down and back trail or you can continue to another parking area. Great desert scenery all along the way.  Parking area fills up quickly during busy times. Take plenty of water, good sturdy hiking shoes, and a hat. In the hot months go early. "
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,Scenic and easy stroll from Courthouse Towers lot,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We enjoyed our late afternoon the Park Avenue hike. We hiked up from the Courthouse Towers lot instead of going down (and consequently back up) from the Park Avenue lot. From Courthouse Towers the hike is flat to a bit up so the return is all downhill. I was surprised to see water in pools in the slick rock. It’s a scenic and easy stroll.
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,Favorite short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My favorite short hike was through Park Avenue canyon, two miles round-trip. You’re surrounded by huge rock fin walls and views of Courthouse Towers, the Three Gossips and Tower of Babel."
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,What a beautiful hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We primarily went to Arches National Park to see the arch formations but we really enjoyed the Park Avenue area as well. This is a 1-mile trail (each way) that starts at the Park Avenue parking area and gently descends into a canyon, following a wash and ending up by the Courthouse rock. It was easy enough for all of our kids to walk, even the 3 year old, who loved it."
Park Avenue Trail,4.5,Most impressive view in Arches National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you don't want to take the hike don't fail to get out of your car and make the very short walk to the observation area.  Park Avenue is, in my opinion, the greatest visual treat in the Park and pictures just do not do this justice.  The depth of the view is simply breathtaking, so don't fail to get out and see this spectacular view."
Kanarra Falls,4.5,"Overrated, over-priced",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike and the falls are way over-rated. The falls are maybe 20 feet tall at best. Very little of the hike is actually in a slot canyon, so if that's a preference of yours, definitely skip. The views along the hike are nice at times, but nothing more than a lot of places Utah has to offer. A big reason why this is 2 stars is because the fee is $15/person (!!!!). I've hiked better falls without a fee. I recommend you spend your time at one of many other nearby options--Zion, Kolob, Quail Creek, Sand Hollow, Cedar Breaks, the list goes on. Depending on your group size, your fee for this hike would put you well on your way to paying for a national park annual pass."
Kanarra Falls,4.5,"Hike to remember, great one!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hike  in the most beautiful nature. We took our time to enjoy it all, so spend about 4 hours on this hike.  Our feet got super cold, the water is very low temperature even in July when the air is around 90F there.   We took our water shoes off and had a good break in the sun and got them warm in no time.  Were little disappointed could not climb up the last fall and see the end of the canyon, but absolutely enjoyed the day trip from Las Vegas to this fantastic place.  We had a late lunch at the Linski's Grill and Hotel after the hike & highly recommend it.  It's located just few miles from the trailhead in the town of Kanarraville."
Kanarra Falls,4.5,Great Hike! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A truly amazing hike! :) the limited  access makes it even better avoiding crowds. We started very early in the morning and the water temperature was definitely cold, but manageable. Looking forward to hiking there again!  "
Kanarra Falls,4.5,Lovely hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wow! What an amazing hike! I am really glad they limit the number of people daily visiting this gorgeous canyon. It is a very well maintained trail. The water was definitely cold, but tolerable. I wore Chaco sandals and they worked great. My husband and sister wore wool socks with hikers. There are SEVERAL waterfalls!  I would hike this again in a heartbeat."
Kanarra Falls,4.5,Awesome creek and slot canyon hiking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was so awesome! You do need to make reservations on line, so don't forget that. Also, the creek waters are cold and you cannot avoid getting wet eventually. We wore neoprene divers booties which was helpful. I wore those closed toe hiker sandals over my booties so as to have some grip and toe protection. Also, at least one hiking pole would be helpful."
Kanarra Falls,4.5,Amazing!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"By far one of the best hikes I’ve enjoyed from start to finish. The trail, scenery & experience kept on getting better as we went along. Was not expecting to be so thrilled & surprised by this hike. Laughed & smiled the entire way, was even better than the Grand Canyon! Highly recommend."
Kanarra Falls,4.5,this hike is well worth the time and effort,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Love love love this hike, this was my first time hiking this trail. it is easy to get the permit on line. Hiked in the winter and it was gorgous everwhere you looked. The hike was moderate, it is strenous because having to crossed numeorus creeks and hiking on the river  rocks/pebbles, it would be easy if you dont mind getting your shoes wet.Wwater level was on ankle high. "
Kanarra Falls,4.5,"Kanarraville Falls Hike, Great for Families",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an awesome experience with the entire family.  You start off on a dirt hiking trail which leads to a creek.  Once you reach the creek, it is your choice whether you want to hike the dirt trail or hike in the creek.  The majority of the creek is less than 1 foot deep, but it can get up to about 3 feet deep in certain sections.  I definitely recommend this hike during the summer because the creek water will keep you cool.  There are a few small water falls you can reach the deeper you hike up the creek. Two of the water falls require you to climb up some make-shift ladders, so be careful, especially with your children.  This was a beautiful hike which the kids absolutely loved, this is by far a much better hike than Emerald Pools in Zion.  Be prepared to pay $10 for parking, but there is no park entrance fee. "
Kanarra Falls,4.5,Great Slot Canyon Hike near Kolob Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is close to the North Kolob Canyon section of Zions.  You take I-15 and exit at the Kanarraville exit and go into the town.  On the main street about XX South you turn left at a sign that says River hike.  There’s a parking lot at the end of the road with a self pay station that costs $10.  There’s signs in the neighborhood around the parking area that say no parking, tow away zone.  It was a hot summer day.  Wear water shoes and maybe even a swim suit or quick dry shorts. The beginning of this hike is along a hot, dry road.  Stick with it.  It crosses the creek a couple of times before it starts to parallel the creek.  It was morning and the water was icy cold until it got warmer.  All the way to the end, we were avoiding being in the water since the water was so cold.  All the way back, it was a lot warmer and it felt good to be in the water.  You can avoid getting more than your feet wet until the second ladder.  You eventually get to the first ladder after going through a really good slot cancyon.  The ladder has rungs nailed across a lot with big sturdy nails.  A couple of the rungs are missing, but the big nails are still there, so you can use them as you climb up.  About a half mile after the first ladder, you pass a place that makes a good water slide.  It’s a little waterfall area with a flat rock surface that you can slide down.  The bank there has some good sitting rocks and we ate lunch there while a few of the people in our group played on the slide.  You enter another slot canyon and you finally reach the second ladder.  It is a little deeper here.  The waterfall hits directly on the ladder and you could get wet here.  It really only hits your knees and you don’t get too wet.  A few people in our party decided to wait it out and not go up.  We saw a couple with a year old baby in a backpack come down that ladder.  It’s really not as bad as it looks.  It goes farther in the slot canyon and opens up a bit.  We turned around after talking to some people coming back that said there wasn’t really anything else interesting past there.  It took us about 4 ½ hours including eating lunch.  It was quite hot on that final dirt road section just before the parking lot.  This was a great hike for a hot summer day."
Kanarra Falls,4.5,My kids favorite hike so far...,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I believe Kanarra Creek that TA is referring to is in Kanarraville which is not in Zion Nat'l Park.  This hike was great.  If you get into Kanarraville drive down the main road and you will undoubtably see a sign directing you to the parking lot.  They charge $10 to park.  From the parking lot it is my estimation that you have a solid mile to the entrance to the slot canyon.  Prior to the slot canyon you will cross the creek several times.  Once you enter the slot you will have to hike in the water.  It is cold.  After about a half hour I'm not sure if my feet went numb or I just adapted.  You have to ascend two falls.  When we did it in August of 2012 there were some trees positioned so you could climb up with ropes attatched to the walls.  The first fall was approximately 8 feet and the second was about 10 feet.  My kids at ages 8 and 11 had no problem and I saw people doing it with babies in backpacks.  Shortly after the second fall is an area called the waterslide.  We completely missed it since I did not know what I was looking for.  However, on the way out we found other people using it.  My kids loved it and the sliding into a shallow pool rejuvinated them.  They caught a little lizard they fought over.  Talking to others, you can supposedly exit out the top.  We hiked about a mile up from the waterslide and there were no more falls and it was more of the same.  It was a hot August day and my kids loved it.  It is a fairly easy hike as we saw all ages on the trail.  No pass or reservation is required.  Bring your water and a snack/lunch if you are going to hang out for a while.  Kanarraville is about 12 miles south of Cedar City and 35ish miles north of St. George.  Enjoy."
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,Worth it even if you don't finish,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started this trail at the Aspen St. trailhead. I knew we probably wouldn't make it the entire hike as we are flat landers who had just arrived at elevation and this is a pretty steep hike going up. It was still absolutely worth it. We did about 1.5 mile total (round trip). Just turned when we felt we reached out limit. The views of the town in the canyon and the mountains beyond are simply stunning. It was a breathtaking hike. On a Sunday in July, it was pretty busy and we passed plenty of people on the trail. The nice thing is there is no restricted parking on Sundays, so we were able to park in the neighborhood very close by the trailhead."
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,"Thrilling, steep challenge",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Catch your breath and hang in there as long as you can for this hike! Definitely harder than Bear Creek, with more inclines and a narrower trail. Part of my family only made it about 1/3 of the loop when it started raining and our exhaustion took over. Watch your steps due to more rocks on trail but pretty flowers noted along the way and amazing views of Telluride! Met many encouraging hikers who advised us to go to the top where some benches await—my teenage son managed to make it there for the worthwhile vantage point."
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,SO hard but worth it!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was NOT an easy hike and it was longer than is advertised on the signage according to my Apple Watch and my husband's fit bit.  We came from sea level and the altitude  made this challenging (two aduls and two teens). But we finished it.  And so happy we did!!!  Beautiful views!!
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,What a challenge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was such a great hike.  We went counterclockwise and I can't remember which way is easier or harder...but I imagine either way is a challenge.  It is a very diverse hike...so many different ""terrains"".  It is a challenge especially with the altitude but I stopped often and loved it.  "
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,Steep hike but worth it.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Not an easy hike but really enjoyable.  We went to the top (to the Neil Armstrong bench) and then flipped and went back down the way we came up even though it's a loop.  4.75 miles with 1228 ft elevation. It took us just under two hours. It's pretty steep in places but most of the hikes around Telluride are.  We went about 6pm and there was no one else out there.
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,Must hike family & friends,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hiked Jud Wiebe on June 7th. Its just a quick walk in downtown telluride to get to the trail head. It’s ~3-3.5 mi loop. Easy BEAUTIFUL hike. I recommend for kids/family. A must do if you’re visiting Telluride. Many great views🏔. There was no snow 👍🏼. Bring hat/sunscreen/sunglasses☀️.
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,Underrated Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Underrated- It was steep on the way up, but this was probably our favorite trail while in town. It was easily accessible and a wonderful experience. Be sure to bring plenty of water and perhaps a snack. Plenty of shade throughout and gorgeous views. Plenty of families and dogs on the trail and an overall enjoyable experience."
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,Challenging For Me But Worth It,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail beats the Bear Creek Trail for views by far! What is great about both trails is that you can get to the trailheads by walking thru town. The elevation of over 10,000 feet stopped me in my tracks about every 50 yards or so, but I made it to the top and the views are spectacular! While it took me (late 60s) to complete this hike, both my  husband and I found it to be a fun and worthwhile trek. Even though I struggled, I would do it again!"
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,"It's Jud Wiebe, not Jed",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a wonderful loop that gets one right up & out of town pretty quickly...it can be fairly strenuous if done quickly. The two trailheads might be more accurately called west (off N. Aspen St.) and east (off Tomboy Rd) than north & south. The trail is named for Jud Wiebe, a past local USFS recreation specialist."
Jud Wiebe Trail,4.5,Moderately Strenuous / Great Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Used to be a daily staple of mine when I lived in town, since the trailheads are in town and it's a relatively short loop (1:15 at a brisk pace).   It's definitely a notch or two greater than Bear Creek in terms of strenousness, but by the same token is not exceedingly difficult.  There is no need for technical skills and pitches aren't exceedingly steep, it's just that it's fairly well sustained."
Sleeping Bear Dunes,4.5,Hidden gem.   Wonderful views and a good physical challenge.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was expecting something like the Indian dunes.  An easy walk to the beach.   Instead, i found four miles of 500 foot sand dunes, cypress trees, and breathtaking views.  "

We are physically fit and spent a little more than two hours for round trip."
Sleeping Bear Dunes,4.5,Great way to dip toes in lake michigan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was surprised when we got to the lot around 9am there were almost no cars!  Took around an hour to get to lake michigan.   Enjoyed sitting on the small strip of sand for awhile before starting the trek back.  We were happy we wore keens, as it made it easy to stop and dump sand out frequently.  Worth the effort."
Sleeping Bear Dunes,4.5,"Tough, but Worth It",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The dune climb is the ultimate experience at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and a real bucket-list item.  It's tough though, not for those with medical conditions.  It's 110 feet up sand to the FIRST plateau, then 100+ feet MORE up to the very top.  The view is WORTH IT!  If you are physically able, it's a lifetime experience.  If you're not physically able, stay down and take pictures of the rest of your group."
Sleeping Bear Dunes,4.5,"Heed the warnings and advice. Wear/bring footwear, wear a hat, wear sunscreen and bring lots of water. Worth the effort",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Most travelers interested in visiting Sleep Bear Dunes National Lakeshore will have heard of and read about the challenging “Dune Climb.” This is not a climb from the shore of Lake Michigan but one inland starting from a parking lot and the starting point of the Dune Trail that will take you to the lake. Along the way there will be numerous additional dunes to traverse but this first one is the tallest. More on that later. This initial dune might be the most popular spot in the national lakeshore and so plan accordingly, especially at the height of summer which is when we visited.  "

Sleeping Bear Dunes,4.5,Great dune hike to Lake Michigan,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Arrived early on a Sunday morning and paid $25 for the park entrance pass at the Philip Hart Visitor Center. At the Center, there is a short, but informational film of the park and mini museum, which includes a gift shop.  First we hiked the sand dunes which included going up and down steep sand dunes to Lake Michigan.  I used sneakers which helped to avoid sinking down in the sand as much and to get better traction, but a lot of people went with bare feet.  Also, we went early to find good parking and to avoid the heat.  If you go later, it can get hot on the sand, so bring water and sunscreen.  The hike took about 3 - 3 1/2 hours, which included stops for breaks and taking photos.  Afterwards, we drove on the scenic drive, which offers some nice views.  Finally, we completed our stay by visiting the Glen Haven Historic Village and stopped to visit the Life Saving Service Station Maritime Museum which had nice exhibits and displays describing the history of life saving on the lake.  Regarding pets, the regulations state that pets are allowed on the hiking trails, but not on the dune hiking area, North Bar Lake and some swimming areas, but I saw that some people brought them anyway.  In total, we spent about 6 hours there, but it was a great way to spend the day."
Sleeping Bear Dunes,4.5,Awesome!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ran by the dune trailhead while participating in the Empire, MI marathon/half-marathon on 6 Oct 12 and decided we just had to return to climb the dune. Took our nature loving dog with us as always and began the climb to the top thinking it might take about 5 min. Upon arriving at what we thought was the top of the dune and expecting to see mightly Lake MI over the crest we were surprised to find another stretch of sand before us with a second dune in the distance. This scenario repeated itself several more times before our eureka moment...visually check one of the many blue-tipped trail markers! Once we did this, we  discovered that the hike to the water up and down the dunes was 1.5 miles one way! Although my wife slightly protested the inconvenience, she troopered along until we reached the water and despite the less than optimal weather we were rewarded with an absolutely stunning panoramic view of the big lake. Amazing! Upon returning to the vehicle, we encountered our second oversite of the day in the form of a very large US Forest Service Park Ranger who inquired as to whether or not we saw the numerous ""no dogs allowed"" signs posted along the base of the dune? We humbly replied that we had not and after checking my drivers license for evidence of further misconduct he politely released us with only a written warning and verbal advice on the delicate ecosystems of the area that mandated the dog free zone. Although slightly embarrassed about the whole incident, the professionalism of the Park Ranger allowed us to survive the ordeal without too much undue stress. In the end, we all had a wonderful time (including our dog:) and will not soon forget the beauty and majesty of this delightful area!  "

Some of the trails could be a little more defined...there were a few times I wasn't even sure if I was on a trail or not.  That said, you can hike to quite a few spots that have amazing views of Colorado Springs.  I especially liked hiking the southern trails (Kinnickkinnick and Grandview Trails) and got some really nice views from Signal Hill.

However, 10 minutes into our outing, there were at least three “questionable” vehicles that had driven past our table (they were turning around).  My husband and I started to feel this area was not as family friendly as we had hoped, so we left.  Admittedly, these feelings were based only on our perception of three vehicles and their passengers, but I have learned to trust my instincts.  "

Palmer Park,4.5,Time at Palmer Park Colorado Springs Colorado,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a fantastic park that is family and animal oriented. You can park in the parking lot and walk the trails, it has a dog run and playground equipment for children. The view from the top of the trails is spectacular. You will occasionally run into deer who love to sleep here during the day time. One of the best family parks for any size family."
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,What a great park for hiking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great park for hiking, with two orienteering trails set up - not too easy yet not too hard. The Visitor Center shouldn't be overlooked either, with a room on how the park came to be as well as hands-on exhibits for the kids. Stamps for the NPS passport are also in the center as well. Recommended."
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,Great Network of Trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Catoctin contains a nice network of trails with several great views. I hike were year round. The nature and historical displays in the visitors center were recently updated. One of the shorter hikes leads to a site used by bootleggers during prohibition. During the week, you can always find parking. On the weekends the lot can fill quickly. Free parking & free entry."
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,Set expectations to the season,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although this park is open throughout the year, a large portion of the road that runs through the park and several stops that are in the open section of the park were closed (despite what the ranger said at the visitor center), which was disappointing. We were wanting to walk on one of the easier hiking loops but those were located off sections of the park that were closed.  We managed to find a picnic area, where we were all by ourselves.  It was in part of the park that was closed off from cars but we accessed it by a 10 minute hike  from the area where we were able to park the car (which was not very scenic).  We had hoped to spend a few hours here but only stayed about hour due to so much of the areas to (legally) park your car were closed off, which prevented us from accessing their easier hiking trails. We will have to come back when the weather is warmer   "
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,Trees and Hills,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"An Appalachian Mountain Park with lots of trees and hills. The visitor center is basic, constructed by the CCC in the 1930s as were the camp ground buildings. We used the picnic grounds. We were disappointed that a ranger program we drove to was cancelled without notice. Long hikes are required to see many of the highlights of the park."
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,Pretty Day,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was very busy. A beautiful day for August, not too hot.  My husband and I couldn't find parking in the area we intended to hike so we only drove through. (We didn't have very much time to stop so we decided to return another day).  It is very pretty and I look forward to another visit!"
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,Very Green,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a well maintained park with plenty of trails ranging from easy to strenuous. The trails are well maintained with lots of signage. There is plenty of parking. Even though we went a Saturday afternoon on the first day of summer, not too many people were at the park. Or if there was a lot of people, there was plenty of trails to spread them all out."
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,Great trails and views.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This park has great trails and views. I would have given a 5 out if 5 but the map does mislead the terrain in my opinion. They say gentle but are a climb here and there. We did do the Blue blazes whiskey still which was gentle and a nice in and out walk. We also hog rock and blue ridge trails which I would rate as moderate. Make sure you stop at the visitor center and get your stamp. 
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,LITTLE-KNOWN RECREATIONAL NATIONAL PARK WITH MANY HISTORIC & SCENIC HIKING TRAILS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Catoctin Mountain Park is a national park.  It was created by workers of the CCC and WPA as a recreational park under FDR’s administration in the 1930‘s and became part of the National Park System in 1936.  The park was renamed in 1954.  
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,Camp Misty Mount- Easy Camping Trip from DC Region,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Within Catoctin Mountain Park is the definitely rustic, decidedly low-key historic Camp Misty Mount. Built during the Works Progress Administration for the girl scouts, Misty Mount is an easy-going, small collection of stone and log cabins perfect for all sorts who want a back-to-the-basics camping experience without the hassle of a tent. "
Catoctin Mountain Park,4.5,"No Peace, No Quiet",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We like to go camping over Labor Day, so this year we chose Owens Creek Campground.  Our actual camp site was nice.  Level tent area, large site, nice fire ring, lovely woods, great access.  It should have been a wonderful weekend.  There are 50 camp sites and a grand total of two (2) showers, one for women, one for men.  Plan accordingly.  While the restrooms had hot and cold running water as well as an outside area for washing dishes, the bathroom stalls were frequently out of toilet paper, I never saw any hand soap, and the other campers trashed the restroom to the point that the floor was a muddy mess."
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Date hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went to get dinner fresh air during the Covid 19 pandemic. It was our first time there and we didn't pay too much attention to the color of trails, but we went up the trail near the helicopter (Lifestar) pad. Yes I said Lifestar... we'r new the trail had potential to be dangerous when we saw that. As we went through the trails we realized it wasn't the trails but the cliffs if you went to close. The scenery is beautiful at the top. The tower was closed but we still had a great time."
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Great hike with the tower at the end that is amazing history,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I had read ahead of time about this being a pretty and fun hike. What I didn’t know in advance was the amazing history to the tower on top. Definitely recommend hiking up here when you can go inside and walk to the top of the tower.
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Variety of Hiking Options with Great Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Talcott Mountain offers a variety of different hiking trails, many of which lead to the top and the Heublein Tower. This park is wonderful during the fall, as it offers foliage during the hike. The main and shortest trail to the top is moderate: the initial 10-15 minutes of the hike are decently steep and will get your blood pumping but after that it levels off and becomes a much easier hike. In addition to the tower, at the top there are a bunch of picnic tables so you can pack a lunch/snacks and eat them at the top with a great view. I definitely recommend this place to bring family and anyone visiting! Well worth the effort for the views."
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5, Beautiful park ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Talcott Mountain is a beautiful state park in Connecticut. Do some of the hikes and trails to the top and you are afforded with some beautiful views.
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Heublein Tower is worth the hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The one-plus mile walk to the tower is well worth the hike.  The view from the top of the hill is great, but the 360 view from the tower is fabulous (on a clear day).  Not to be done in high heels or with a baby stroller!"
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Picnic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Talcott mountain is a great place to go either for a couples hike and picnic or a family hike. The area is beautiful on a clear day you are able to see Bradley international airport, and as far as Massachusetts. It is inexpensive there is no fee to tour the tower/house."
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Great view of fall foliage,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved our hike to see the fall colors of Connecticut.  Google and other map sites gave us odd directions and led us to a few private roads/dead ends, but we managed to find the start.  Google ""Summit Ridge Rd,"" which is the road that leads you to the trailhead (off Rt 185/Hartford Rd in Simsbury). Parking is on the side of the road and limited.  It took us about 45 min up, 30 min down. We enjoyed the view and should have packed a lunch to eat at the top."
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Nice walk up not too strenuous,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are in shape this is a pleasant round trip walk up and back of about an hour. Take the time to watch the informational historical video at the top. Beautiful day, nice fresh air walk. "
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Easily the best hike in the valley,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've gone on this hike at least 2x a year for over 18 years, since I was a young kid. I go in mid-spring, and right when the leaves are turning in the fall (and then whenever I feel like it during the summer)."
Talcott Mountain State Park,4.5,Absolutely Wonderful AND FREE!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Talcott Mountain/Heublein Tower a must see.  As others have mentioned, the first 15 minutes of the hike from Summit Road (actually its a parking lot) can be steep, but once you reach the ridge (youll know when you are there), its a very easy hike.  Dogs are welcome on a leash, but not something you will be pushing a stroller on (come on, this is hiking!).  Gets VERY busy mid-October when the leaves are turning, but other times of the year you may end up having the place to yourself.  I enjoy going there in August when there is a nice breeze at the top.  Look for the pavilion at the top for a place to picnic with a killer view.  The tower is open from Memorial Day to Oct 31st from 10-5.  There is a store in the tower that sells unique items, and proceeds to the non-profit group that supports the tower (www.friendsofheubleintower.org).  Lots of historical information and artifacts in the building, and on the landings to the top of the tower (yes, you must climb stairs to get there).   Great views from the top of Hartford, Mount Tom in Mass, watching the planes fly in/out of Bradley Airport to the north. There is no handicapped access."
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,"A long way back, but we circled back two years later to see them.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were on our way from the Black Hills in South Dakota to Denver, Colorado and happen to stumble upon the Rifle Pits marker on the highway between Guernsey, Wyoming and Interstate 25. We were really interested in the marker when we got home and started reading about it which lead us to reading about the wagon ruts and Register Cliff. Briefly, the Mormons followed the Oregon Trail (some inscriptions on the wall show Caucasian travelers as far back as the late 1700s) and their wagon wheels literally carved a road into the stone as the steel from the wheels ground down the stone. There also significant US history here with skirmishes with the Native Americans as well as the Pony Express Route. This is one of those areas that you could spend all day at. We did it in a couple hours and felt rushed. There is significant signage here to read and some walking. The ruts and Register Wall are difficult if you are physically challenged and are not suitable for wheel chair guests. They no longer teach this stuff in the public schools and it’s a great place to teach kids about the history of the Western Expansion of the United States in the Colorado Territory. You will be amazed at the landscapes getting here. There are restrooms and picnic facilities here."
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,Free off the beaten track piece of history,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a bit out of the way and we had to follow the signs to find it. You walk down a path, across a bridge from the parking lot, about 1/10 a mile. There are a number of plaques that tell the story of the significance of the Oregon Trail on which more than 500,000 pioneers journeyed west . The 4 foot trail ruts here are some of the deepest ones of the Oregon trail. Very interesting and free"
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,Interesting ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Found it interesting that this was only monumented in 1966! Had no one cared until then? 
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,Quick stop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is worth stopping for for a quick stretch of your legs and to see a neat historic site. You walk a paved path that does have an upward slope/steps. But it’s a short walk and really cool to see the trail ruts. Amazing to think how many folks traveled through to make them. The 90s kid in me loved this.
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,So much fun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Such a fun experience.  We had been 25 years ago, and a lot has changed.  The accommodations are so nice, and dog friendly.  The ruts are incredible to explore and to image what it must have been like to cross the plains in a covered wagon.  There was several picnic tables under a pavilion.  There were benches along the route.  The views of Guernsey are great."
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,May Trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Short walk to the ruts. It is hard to imagine how difficult it must have been to cause such deep ruts. You can touch the history. It was a special experience to be there. A must see place. Went in early May and had the place to ourselves. It was a great feeling.
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,A short walk and Plesant visual experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is just wat it advertises, a preserved section of the Oregon Trail cut into the soft limestone hill by thousands of wheels, hoofs and feet.  It is a short side trip outside of Guernsey, Wyoming along a short gravel road.  Well worth the time and effort for a visual experience. "
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,Well preserved history,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I was so excited to see the trail ruts in Guernsey. They’re a fantastic relic of the Oregon trail and very well preserved and maintained. There is an ADA walkway to get to the ruts and historic market as well as a more scenic path with steps. Highly recommend if you’re into history.
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,Experince real history of this great country,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Located in this small town, this is a nice hour stop to see the remains of a important part of our history. You can see the trails left in the soft Stone from hundreds of wagons on their trek west on the Oregon Trail. Imagine traveling though this region when  it was still wilderness. The ruts park has double access from the parking lot.Go to the left from the parking lot and climb sever small stairs to see the ruts, got the right and the walk is longer but is a more gradual incline with no stairs. better for wheelchairs or strollers."
Oregon Trail Ruts,4.5,Wow! Made the 1848 Oregon Trail come Alive for ME!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are from Virginia, so really know little about the details of the experiences of the settlers who traveled the Oregon, Gold Rush or Utah Trails. What perseverance our ancestors had - a 4-5 month travel time while walking 2000 miles beside oxen pulling a huge wagon with all of your worldly possessions to a new life. Mind boggling. I read it required about the equivalent of $1000 to provision your family for the journey. This location with the wagon wheel ruts deep in the sandstone is a memorial to the 200,000 who dreamed of a better life or gold or religious freedom. Made the hair rise up on my arms.  The beautiful site next to the Platte River has a quick self-guided tour and a lovely picnic shelter if you carried a lunch. It is handicap accessible. My only complaint is that it is not well marked on the highway and needs better directional signage. We pulled into a state park entrance and the ranger working the booth sent us to the right place. This is well worth your time - Don't miss it!"
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Santos to SR200 Awesome,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We biked the paved trail from Santo's staging area west to where the pavement ends at SR200 and loved it. Nice and wide, undulating, and mostly shaded it was perfect for us. From Santo's to the end of the pavement is about 16 miles one way, there are tables and restrooms at Land Bridge trailhead and 49Ave trailhead but no drinking water is available anywhere on the trail."
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Return to an even better trail experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a yearly return trip now with my dog to camp and ride the trails . Things are even better since they have paved a long section of the trail all the way to the “Land Bridge”. With the COVID-19 restrictions now in place everyone did a great job of staying their distance and people were very respectful of noise restrictions after the curfew. And now with the paved trail there are a wide variety of bikes are able to enjoy this beautiful area, including myself pulling my dog trailer.🐶❤️"
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Nice quiet state park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Santos is a very nice small campground with plenty of room to spread out and not be on top of your neighbors. We stayed in site 21 on the outer loop and 20 on the inner loop and both were comfortable, shady and spacious. The bathrooms are clean with plenty of hot water, but there only 2 showers and toilets in both the men’s and ladies for all 23 sites. While they are clean, they are not pristine and likely not maintained throughout the day like a private campground. There is no camp store, laundry or other amenities but it is a lovely, quiet park with a lot of trails for hiking, biking and equestrian use. We enjoyed biking the paved trail which was fairly flat and mostly shaded and we passed a lot of mountain bikers, walkers and folks on horseback sharing the trails along the way. We would definitely recommend this park. At $22/night it’s a great value. "
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,A great ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband, two friends and I rode the Santos Trail to the I-75 bridge, which was about 15 miles round trip. It was a beautiful sunny day and it was a beautiful ride. The trail is all paved and a fairly easy ride, fairly flat with some easy incline and decline. We would definitely ride more of it next time."
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Have fun!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Santos trail is the best in Florida! It is wide, paved, wanders through diverse terrain. There are lots of bikers on this trail, especially low three wheel bikes. You need to be careful and they don’t always “share the road”! It’s especially fun to ride over the Land Bridge over I-75!! Have fun!"
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Amazing Time with teens!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was a misty cold rainy day! We went by the trails and Santos Bike Shop across from the trail rented us great bikes with helmets and provided us with information on the level of the trails. Due to the wet conditions we took the paved one.  Other people went mountain biking and loved it as well! We biked in a shaded trail for 15 miles, it was a great time!"
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Santos and Vortex Mountain Biking Trails - Ocala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Rode for 2 days.  Mostly covered by tree canopy (just west of Ocala National Forest) and very well marked trails.  Accessed core trails from Santos bike shop on 441 then connected w Pine Tree trail.  The main Trail Head is located off 80th Street.  
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Wonderful New Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Most of the posts about the Santos Trailhead mention only the mountain bike trails, and use the word ""awesome"" in at least ever other sentence.  The mountain bike trails are OK, but the big news is the magnificent (much better than ""awesome"") new paved trail stretching 16 miles SW from the Santos Trailhead on US 441 opened in February 2018.  It is Florida's newest paved bike trail, and one of the few which does not depend, at least in part, on old railroad beds.  This is a built-from-scratch flowing (to use a mountain bike term) trail through the sandhills of the Central Ridge of Florida, along the old Barge Canal Greenway.  The trail crosses I-75 on the famous land bridge, which is a ""crittur crossing"" over the Interstate, allowing wildlife (including cyclists) to cross the highway in safety.  It also passes through a couple of tunnels under State highways.  "
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Yikes,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Going the easy trail/yellow markers out and then doubled back because we didn't want to overdo it. On the way back the markers are different and there are two yellow trails that brings confusion. One is marked Shorty which is not and takes you and extra 6 miles off the beaten trail back to the highway. We then proceeded to walk up the highway back to the parking area. I did not want to take a chance on going back to the trails which were very unfriendly and poorly marked. Most of the bikers were kind but did not one yielded to us, the hikers. I felt like maybe I misunderstood the signs but after re-evaluating realized that it was not me but the bikers who misinterpreted. One pair refused to stop and there was nowhere for me and my daughter to go so they about ran into to us and then were quite rude verbally. If I went back I may be tempted to take bear spray and use it even if I didn't see any bears. Our 3 mile hike turned into 12.5 miles. I am going to see about getting a guide for next time."
Santos - Belleview Trail,4.5,Awesome place to ride a bike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wonderful place to spend the day bike riding.  We did all easy trails as it was our first visit.  Trails area all well marked and in great condition.  Lots of interesting twists and turns which is nice change from long straight bike paths.  They have more adventerous trails in the park but we did not visit.  Park has over 100 miles of trails.  Will plan a visit to the Ocala area just to ride these trails again.
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,"Um, a nice park, but underwhelming",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well, we’re from Minnesota where we have lots of water and swimming holes. This one is 125ft deep and goes deep back into the rocks. The creek that leads away from it was nearly bone dry."
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,No need to go to Jacob's Well,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"7 year old, fishing in a creek area with less than two or three feet of water.  Our five minute visit to Jacob's well area ended with child almost in tears, asking what was happening, terrified at the Park employee's screaming. "
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,Awful,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Well this was awful! We pull up and signs are up say everything is full. So we just ask to make sure and the guy says oh yeah go right in and swim. So he directs us to our parking spots and we start walking and it’s not a bad walk at all. So we get down to the hole and start taking our shoes off and the little wannabe ranger is down there asking if we have stamps so we tell her the man just told us to come on down and swim and she said he didn’t say that we were like umm yeah he did and she thought we were lying so we tell her to call the guy that told us that and she said HE’S UNDER ME! HE DID NOT SAY THAT! We walked back out and left. This place is nothing special.
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,Would be a good nature area in May and June,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We recently spent some time at Jacob's Well during a trip to San Antonio.  Neat area for wildlife, especially birds and snakes.  We didn't swim as the swimming hole is booked up through early September.  They book for two hour blocks.  Honestly, I would get pretty bored swimming there because it's very very small and the group size is fairly large that they allow to swim.  It's a neat well, pretty colors and I'm glad we stopped.  But not a type of area that would draw me back to it."
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,Disappointing,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Very disappointed that access to water is limited. Turned around and hiked up the trail back to parking lot. Website very misleading and didn’t stay 5 minutes didn’t even get wet. No wonder people dive in it looks like the only way to get to water.
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,Little well with a deep impact,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Not gonna lie.  I thought the width of the well would have been bigger but it was absolutely beautiful to see.   We didn’t go during swim season and that was because it was quiet and there were few others to take away from the beauty of nature.   But we for sure will come back to swim soon!
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,I loved it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I’d seen it on the internet, and heard people rave about it, so I had to see for myself. It’s a really nice spot, I’d recommend it for adults and kids. Excellent photo ops, and just a great site to take in some nature and get away from the screen time."
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,Short quick hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Did a quick hike down to the well on a beautiful Saturday in March.  It took us 12 minutes to get down to the well area, looked around for maybe 10 minutes than hiked on back.  Water levels are pretty low and no way I would get in the water even if it was allowed.  But nice little hike and some beautiful scenery down there.  It would not be much fun if it was crowded so we were lucky."
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,Overrated ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was super cool to see! But too far to actually be worth it. It’s not a long hike which might be nice when you are swimming. Very slippery when not wet so I would be prepared! It was free to just walk around. We had extra time so it’s not like we wasted time, but we did drive a bit out of the way to see it. "
Jacob's Well Natural Area,4.5,Great place for short hikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Short, easy hikes through well-maintained natural area.  The well itself was pretty cool to see too.  Great place to just wander around and see some typical hill country landscape.  "
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,An absolute blast for the whole family!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gabis Arboretum (formerly Taltree) is so awesome! It's the perfect place to let the kids run around and explore nature! There is a music garden with instruments; an adventure garden with mini houses to play in; and best of all, the Railway Garden (open Fri.-Sun., May-October). All of the volunteers and employees we've met have been extremely friendly and helpful. At $10 per carload, you can bring the whole family into the arboretum for an extremely reasonable price! And if you plan on going often, membership is only $50/year! Worth every penny!"
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,Good family place to visit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We had heard of the train display so we decided to check it out. It is amazing. Tons of details to look at. If your kids like trains this will keep busy for at hour and a half to 2 hours. The overall Arboretum is quote large and has several trails to explore. We enjoy nature and gardens so this was very nice. Some areas are not as expansive and some are under rehab. Overall a good place for a family visit.
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,No trains for covid,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Had family in town and decided to go check out taltree, since the kids always have a blast there. We were disappointed that they're not running the trains with covid, I have no idea why, there's plenty of space to distance yourself. Also disappointed to see they got rid of the animals."
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,I'm stuck at the entry fee,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were visiting the dunes and thought we'd add a bit of variety by checking out Taltrees. I'm okay with paying an entrance fee but that means I will expect more and rightly so. The $10 per adult is very steep, outrageously so, considering what they provide."
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,One Acre Outdoor Railway Gardens plus more!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you like trains, view this garden (G-scale) layout covering almost one acre! Seven train layouts travel on over 3000 linear foot of track including over 30 bridges. Trains move among built to scale prairies, mountains, and canyons over and around 850 tons of limestone brought onsite. Gardens include hiking trails through wooded and grassy areas as well as flower beds. Great fun all included with admission. Recently joined in educational partnership with Purdue University Northwest."
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,Where are all the fish??,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the disappointing arboretums I've been to! Maybe I'm spoiled by the Shedd Chicago arboretum, I can admit that. However, a few fish in a pond is NOT what I paid for!  Where are the sea horses, starfish, tropical fish and swordfish??  At the very least have a tank of clown fish for everyone to look at. "
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,Railroad Garden That Dreams Are Made Of,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Taltree Arboretum and Gardens has the largest public railroad garden in the Midwest. It truly is a gem in the prairie. While it is not located in town, it makes up for the drive by it's beauty. I can say that with a doubt I more than a couple of ideas back home for my railroad. The railroad garden is fully accessible, the concrete paths are great. If you have children, this is a must stop if our traveling on I-80,I-90,I-94. Just slip down and visit. I lost count of the number of bridges on the layout."
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,A place to relax and discover,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Taltree has developed from the early 2000's into one of the most interesting arboretums around.  The prairie, the wetlands with swans, the train garden and other gardens, and the pavilion draw you into a lovely and relaxing setting that is good for observing, hiking, and discovering."
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,Incredible model train set up,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The title pretty much sums up why the 5 sta RSI, but there are some nice walking trails in the vicinity as well."
Gabis Arboretum at Purdue Northwest,4.5,Nice trails and gardens,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful wooded and garden area.  Some of the plants looked like they needed a bit of love, but overall it was very nice.  There is a great miniature train town located in the park as well, that is definitely something kids would love.  There was obviously a lot of care and research put into the train display.  There is a great shelter near a pond that would be wonderful for family gatherings or even an outdoor wedding.  Plenty of nice easy trails, making it a great place to walk."
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Texan Through and Through,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I just visited Ennis and the Bluebonnet Trail this past weekend. The bluebonnets were beautiful, even though it is late in the season."
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,BIRTHDAY WEEKEND CELEBRATION WITH FRIENDS.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Was great travelling the country side looking at the Bluebonnets. Very relaxing drive. Even found a spot where you could walk in a field of Bluebonnets. This was the first time my two friends and I had ever been to Texas to see the Bluebonnets. Have plans to go back probably in 5 years when Ennis will be celebrating the 75th annual Bluebonnet Festival. Never know might be back next year. LOL Got a few pictures unable to upload them at this time.
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Great Experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I went to Bardwell Lake to see the bluebonnets blooming.  It was all very beautiful.  Seeing the fields of bluebonnets, taking in the scent of all the flowers, walking around, and taking photos was so refreshing.   I also love the bright Indian Paintbrush mixed in with the bluebonnets.  Having the lake made it that much better.  Beautiful, peaceful water.  I Ioved seeing the sunlight sparkle on the water.   It's also great if you want to have a picnic.  You can bring a blanket and eat in the fields or you can eat at one of the picnic tables there."
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Bluebonnets,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We went to Ennis to see the famous bluebonnet trails.  The town itself doesn't have bluebonnets everywhere as one might imagine. BUT they do have bluebonnets! They give you a map and you drive to the places where the bluebonnets grow.  Once you find them they really are beautiful! So glad we went
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Beautiful flowers!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I visited Ennis on April 19th in order to see Blubonnets. I visited the welcome center. The people were very nice. I got information about the flowers and trails. I drove around 20 minutes. I saw a lot of beautiful flowers on the trail!
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Bluebonnets to soothe my Texas soul,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We drove to Ennis for an afternoon of Bluebonnet viewing.  We downloaded the trail map on the Ennis website and made most of the local parks where you can take pics.  Then we drove on the South Trail. We went the week before the Featival and there was no traffic. at all on the trail.  
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Beautiful Bluebonnets,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best time to visit is late March to mid-April every year. Brenham and Chappel Hill has some too further South.
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Fields of Blue,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The best location to see a field of bluebonnets is the Meadowview Nature Area just off of Hwy 34. We also found some full fields on Sugar Ridge Road. Don't expect to find field after field of flowers, you may drive some miles before you get to a spectacular field but the drive and time is worth it if you enjoy seeing wild flowers. Also check the Ennis website for the best viewing."
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Not ready yet!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Blue bonnets are not quite ready..
Bluebonnet Trail,4.5,Stunning but WAIT for it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The biggest mistake people make when coming to view bluebonnets is not waiting for their peak!  Bluebonnets appear along the roadside WAY quicker than they appear in fields because the cars' heat encourages an earlier bloom.  Seriously, the best time to view these flowers is the week of the Bluebonnet Festival in Ennis.  It is scheduled there for a reason.  You can call the Visitors' Center for a true update as well.  They are nice folks!  If you can, go see the flowers before the festival on a weekday to avoid the crowds.  It makes a big difference!  Wear close toed shoes and watch for basking snakes."

White House Ruins Trail,5.0,White House Ruins Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail was as impactful as I remembered it (I had visited many years go). You now need a Navajo guide to enter the canyon, but that really just added to the experience. Fantastic trip. My 14 year old son really enjoyed it as well. "
White House Ruins Trail,5.0,Awesome hike to White House Ruin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Took the White House Ruin trail in mid June at Tsegi (De Chelly). 
White House Ruins Trail,5.0,Spiritual Solitude,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I had heard about Canyon de Chelly (pronounced da shay) on our last trip to the Grand Canyon Monument Valley in 2008 and vowed that I would return to the area the next time we were out here.  Unfortunately, we got started a little late from Flagstaff and didn't make it to Canyon de Chelly until about 1.30 pm in the afternoon.  The weather was very windy coming up Rt 191 and cold @ 33-35 degrees.   At the rim, the wind chill was pretty cold.  From the parking area, you have to walk a short distance to the overlook.  I was amazed.  It was clearing with a cobalt blue sky with gleaming white clouds racing across the sky casting shadows in and throughout the canyon and the walls.  I was mesmerized.  I went back to the car and told my wife I was going to do the trail and asked if she wanted to accompany me.  Her aversion to the cold is only surpassed by her aversion to heights and she politely told me to go ahead.  The only way I can describe the next 2-3 hours was spiritual solitude.  The wind and weather had kept most tourists away and even the guided canyon tours were sparse.  I thought I saw people when I viewed the White House from the overlook, but I was not sure.  I took a bottle of water with me and I set out for my walk.  The entire trail is one of switchbacks down to the canyon floor.  Every step is new and exciting and the rock features change as you close the distance to them or away from them.  One piece of advice:  Take your time and turn around and look where you have been both going into and out of the canyon.   The views change with every step you take on the trail.   Two tips also:   No slick shoes and take water.  Even thought the trail is safe, there are places that are uneven and slick.  Hiking boots or tennis shoes.  Something that will grip.  Even though it was a cold March day,  I drained my little water bottle I took with me.  I can only imagine what the heat of summer would be like.  Taking a camera is a no-brainer.  If you have trouble walking, limit what you take weight wise as the trip up is more strenous than the trip down. "
White House Ruins Trail,5.0,"Well worth the effort, the scenery is awesome.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail starts at the side of the car park at the ""White House Ruins Overlook"" approximately 5.5 Miles from the Canyon De Chelly Visitor Centre, on the South Rim Drive."
White House Ruins Trail,5.0,"Vendors ""Ruined"" Our Experience",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"As others described, the hike is tricky, but if you take your time you can do it.  We met a hiker that had hip replacement surgery the year before and he was able to complete the entire hike."
White House Ruins Trail,5.0,Only trail into canyon without a Navajo guide,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail is 1 1/2 miles each way.  As you would expect, it is an easy walk down and more challenging on the way back up (a 600 foot drop).  But most of the trail is not too steep, and there are benches along the way for resting.  The trail is not paved, but it is well-maintained.  I was concerned about taking my children on this trail, but it wasn't too challenging for them, and there weren't many places with steep drop-offs.  There is almost no shade on the trail, so be sure to wear sunscreen and take water."
White House Ruins Trail,5.0,Nice hike from rim to White House ruins,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the highlight of our visit to beautiful Canyon de Chelly!  The trail switchbacks steeply from the rim to the canyon floor.  The geology that you see along the way is really cool.  Breathtaking views all the way as well.  I have some trouble with heights, but this trail has a solid rock wall on one side all the way down and is wide enough that I didn't have any problems with dizziness.  The Navajo vendors along the last part of trail were very nice and friendly.  They had some nice items for sale, too.  The White House ruins at the the end of the hike are impressive.  The hike back up is steep, but it wasn't too hot the day that we went, so it wasn't too bad for this 60 year-old hiker.  Make sure that you take water."
White House Ruins Trail,5.0,Stunning Beauty at this Monument,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a very fun trail that is highly recommended.  People of all ages are capable of completing it. We did the trail early in the morning and although it was in June we weren't too hot. Be sure to look up the history of the ancient ruins you will see at the bottom.  It made our walk more fun. 
White House Ruins Trail,5.0,Spectacular!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful trail! My husband and I are senior citizens, however, we were able to manage the walk down and back quite well. Suggest taking a hiking stick if you are a little unsure about your footing, there is some stepping down required.   There are a couple of narrow spots on the trail, but it is possible to stay close to the wall in most areas.  Anyone who walks or hikes regularly should be able to negotiate this trail. Keep in mind that you hike down first, then have to climb out. This is about 5-6,000 ft. elevation, so factor that into the climb. This trail is well-graded with good switchbacks, making the climb out easier. Enjoy the views!  Then be sure to take the Navajo tour into the Canyon which gives you an entirely different perspective and lots of history of the place."
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,if you want to see what waterfall looks like in dry land,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"did Mossy Cave Trail right before entering Bryce. We checked out the cave and the waterfall. The cave is very small, and you can not enter, but it is indeed cute to see all the moss live on the wall of the cave, since it is very moist. The waterfall is definitely interesting. You will be amazed to see water in this dry land. and because water is keep flashing, the rock under the waterfall is like a big piece of jade Very pretty. But this trail is not in the park. So plan your time well before you go."
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,mossy cave,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Might say the trail was more pleasurable than the cave. There  was no access to the cave, was fenced off. The trail and waterfall was lovely, but not readily easy to get to waterfall,. had to walk up stream edge.  would not recommend for anyone would might have difficulty with hiking ""moderate"" trails."
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,Crowded stop off highway,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stopped off at Mossy Cave Trail in the middle of the afternoon. It was crowded. As we were dealing with Covid-19, people were not social distancing nor wearing masks. There is a trail that winds along a river. Beautiful! the trail forks and you can either walk to the Mossy Cave or a waterfall. The Mossy Cave was cool, but not much to see. We didn't go to the waterfall due to the crowd of people not wearing masks. "
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,"Pretty Views, Easy Trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a peaceful and easy trail with beautiful views. I didn't find the ""cave"" very interesting as it's not really a cave, but the waterfall was very pretty. Get their early, the parking lot is small and people were parking on the highway when we left even though they're not supposed to."
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,"Must stop, walk past waterfall. ",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Waterfall and the cave are great to see, but keep hiking past the falls to see some awesome canyons and creek with little to no visitors. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and it was dead (which was great). No fee to get in this part of the park. "
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,"Easy, Short Hike!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Mossy Cave Hike is a short, very easy hike into a small waterfall & a small mossy cave! The hike is less than a mile roundtrip. The cave itself is a natural, sheltering cave not a cavern. The waterfall is a product of an irrigation ditch dug by local pioneers in the early 1890s. It is a very picturesque area of Bryce Canyon & I learned later in the day that you can hike farther into the canyon if you continue on a trail past the cave & waterfall. "
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,Great way to cool off,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a full and hot day of hiking inside Bryce Canyon and wanted to cool off. This is a short trail. Do not bother hiking on land. Total waste of time. Park your car and walk 5 minutes to the bridge and just get in the water. It’ll cover your shoes, sandals or whatever you are wearing. It might be ankle deep at some spots. Get in and go left. It’ll take you another 15 min of walking against the current to get to the falls. It was so much fun and a great way to cool off.  My kids are 15 and 12 and we stayed and played for at least an hour."
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,A Different Experience at Bryce Canyon National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My son and I visited the Mossy Cave Trail on our visit to Bryce Canyon.  This is a fairly easy hike.  There are hoodoos visible and a stream that was really manmade and dug by Mormon settlers to get water to the settlement of Tropic nearby.  The Mossy Cave was much cooler than the trail.  We were there in May, but there was still big pieces of ice in the cave.  There were no icicles, but I hear those are beautiful at the right time of year.  "
Mossy Cave Trail,4.0,Great addendum to Bryce,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wonder and quick stop on the way in/out of Bryce.  Definitely worth a trip to see the waterfall/stream, along with the weeping cave.  The satellite image on Google is outdated, showing a small parking lot at the trailhead and no overflow lot.  The main lot has been enlarged a bit, and there is a very large RV/overflow dirt lot 1000 feet east.  We arrived at 8am in an RV, and had no problem parking at the trailhead. The trail is mostly level, with a couple bridges along the way.  The whole site can easily be seen in under an hour if you are short on time."

Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,Probably my favorite spot in all of Yellowstone!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This little area is packed with geysers, pools, and paint pots.  The walkways lead to an informative combination of nearly every feature offered in Yellowstone.  It is a very easy walk, with a little bit of elevation, and amazing vistas all around.  There is a large car park, with three one-seater restrooms."
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,"Steam vents, fumeroles, geysers, and mud pots!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This short walk along a boardwalk lets you see examples of most of the attractions of Yellowstone. The bubbling paint pots are fun to watch, and the geysers may be small but erupt almost constantly.  There are other thermal attractions along this short boardwalk as well.  Very interesting - definitely worth the stop."
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,Breathtaking Beauty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"An experience for ALL the senses. Strong smell, beautiful area. Complex natural beauty. If you are going to Yellowstone National Park, you will definitely want to take the time to visit the Fountain Paint Pots. You won't regret it."
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,Worth the Short Loop Drive,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Paint Pot is just part of this really cool short loop drive. As there are a couple geysers, some colorful springs, and petrified wood along the way. The paint pots are easily seen from your vehicle so we didn’t take the time to walk the boardwalk. "
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,Short Trail and Easy to Find Parking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an easy .5 mile board walk trail in the Lower Basin.  We had no issues finding parking at 5:15 pm on a Thursday (9/3).  It took us 30 minutes to do the loop.  Not the most exciting of all the basins but given its short distance, it is a quick bonus."
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,Better than some other geyser stops,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This spot had lots of variety with geysers, mudholes, etc. Take the boardwalk all the way around as there's some great geysers hiding behind the hill. We got to watch one erupt from the start and the other was an ongoing eruption. The pools in the beginning are colorful."
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,Loved this area!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was my favorite stops in YNP. There is a wooden raised walkway around the area. Many pots, beautiful colors. Very interesting and worth the time needed to park. It’s a popular stop for tourists. Best to get there early in the morning."
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,Bear Area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a beautiful sight.  It is a populated area with a small parking lot. You have to have patience to get a parking spot.  The walk is nice and easy with a little elevation.  The views are beautiful. We were able to see bear tracks in the mud around the geysers. 
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,VERY COLORFUL,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Located in the Lower Geyser Basin, this is a one of the smaller (but popular) geyser areas.  The trail is about 1/2 mile long on boardwalks that are in good shape.  I have stopped many times before, but always enjoy my visit. I always seem to see something new here. "
Fountain Paint Pot,4.5,"3.5 stars.  If you are short on time, go ahead and skip this.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you have to ration your geyser and spring stops, this is one you could skip, as you can see very similar attractions in other areas.  Don't get me wrong, it is very interesting and a delight to the eyes.  If you have time though, stop here."
Thundering Brook Falls Trail,4.5,Paths can be confusing.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Parking lot only holds about 10 cars.  Short hike into a deck overlooking the falls but there are multiple trails on the way down from the small parking lot and it is easy to get confused as to which direction to take.  The falls have a nice lookout over them.
Thundering Brook Falls Trail,4.5,Exploring Thundering Falls Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Good trip. We arrived at approximately 5:45 pm and made our way to the entrance of the trail. The beginning of the trail consisted of a pre- made wooden walkway that was very easy to walk on. The rest of the trail consisted of walking on dirt, however the trail was very flat and did not have many inclines/declines. The waterfall in itself was very nice, and there was even a small platform built at the end of the trail that provided for a great photo opportunity."
Thundering Brook Falls Trail,4.5,Nice easy trail but hard to find,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It took us a half hour to find this trail and we were less than 3 miles away. The website said it was at the intersection of routes 4 and 100.  But there are 2 places where it intersects and river Run Road is closed. You have to go to the intersection closer to Woodstock. It is about a 1/4 mile away from the Killington town building down the closed dirt road. The trail is mainly a flat wooden boardwalk. Then up a small hill. About 1/3 mile each way to a nice waterfall
Thundering Brook Falls Trail,4.5,Relaxing beneath the falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Relaxing walk on the boardwalk trail to the falls with a variety of bird and insect life to observe on the way.  Read for 45 minutes alongside the falls in the cool of the shade and water. Traffic to and from was heavy. 
Thundering Brook Falls Trail,4.5,Easy Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a 1/4 mile each way along a boardwalk. Last 50-75 feet is on crushed dirt/gravel mix. It had a slight incline, but easy to walk up to the falls. Great wooden platform to see the falls. Accessible to everyone. Great views as well as you walk along to the fall.  "

Thundering Brook Falls Trail,4.5,"Good, wheelchair accessible path to a great waterfall",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This new boardwalk path travels a short distance from River Road just off the US highway 4, VT Highway 100 near Killington.  It's close to Thundering Brook Road.  The start of the path is on River Road itself, but isn't really signposted from the road, we missed it and took a long drive around the area before luckily seeing it just as we were giving up!  There's a small layby, enough space for about two cars, and you can see the wooden trail snaking over the wetlands from there.  "
Thundering Brook Falls Trail,4.5,Amazing but hard to find,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Totally fun. Very hard to find. Take route 4 then turn onto River road, there is a white sign on the corner that says Recreational and town offices. Follow River road all the way till you pass the rec center and a small white town building, both will be on your right. Just after you pass the town office building there will be a very small dirt parking area on your left that fits about four cars. The parking area is not well marked not are the falls. From the parking lot you can see the boardwalk. Follow the boardwalk to the falls. The falls are beautiful and there are a bunch of cool hiking trails. Went with two kids age 5 and 7. "
Thundering Brook Falls Trail,4.5,Easy thing to do - enjoyable outing - an hour tops,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It has two parts.  First is an easy wood bridge walk to the base of a lovely falls - not a huge falls but beautiful.  The second part is a true steep mountain climb (short) up to the top of the falls - the kind where you grab tree roots to hold on and pull yourself up carefully.  Wear appropriate footwear for this part - good treads - not light summer shoes.  
Kerrville River Trail,5.0,do not miss,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Hill Country was on my bucket list.  Guadelupe River photos of this area made me plan a visit. The city park was nicely done at the River. Great area for picnics, hikes, family get togethers, and it was free. Peaceful area to rest."
Kerrville River Trail,5.0,The Main Reason We Visit and Stay in Kerrville!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the main reason we visit Kerrville!!!

Kerrville River Trail,5.0,Wonderful Multi-use Trail Along the River,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stopped in Kerrville for lunch while on a recent road trip and sought out the river trail to stretch our legs. It's a well-constructed, wide, paved pathway along the Guadalupe River. The landscape was very scenic, and we enjoyed watching the squirrels and waterfowl. The section we walked was near Louise Hays Park, but it looks like the trail is about 4 miles long, following the river between Lowry Park and Riverside Nature Center at the west end and Kerrville-Schreiner Park at the east end. Parking and restrooms are available at the parks, and there are benches along the trail."

Kerrville River Trail,5.0,The best place in Kerrville!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a terrific place to enjoy the great outdoors with family and friends.   There's something for everyone to do here, young and old alike.  I love to ride the trail on my bike. You can even bring your dog,  they can run free in the fenced in dog park. Elsewhere they'll need their leash."
Kerrville River Trail,5.0,This trail needs a good map and website,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Two of us went to the Kerrville River Trail to stretch our legs after too much driving and eating. Our visit could have been greatly improved by better advance information. A clear visitor website with a simple map (like the state parks have) would be helpful. We found great shady parking under the Highway 16 bridge but then didn't know whether to follow the trail east or west. Without advance info from a website, we thought we'd be able to find map signage when we arrived, but we didn't. "
Kerrville River Trail,5.0,"Walk, Relax and Photograph Wildflowers",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The river trail starting, for me, at the Riverside Nature Center and ending at Flat Rock Lake. Is a fine walk especially late morning and early afternoon during the week with few people. I like the trail during this time as it allows for uninterrupted opportunities to photograph a variety of Spring wildflowers during March to May. Rest spots along the trail are well placed and add to the relaxed feel of this well placed public trail."
Kerrville River Trail,5.0,Way to walk!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The river trail is an awesome addition to Kerrville that supplies an outstanding area for families and friends to gather and enjoy nature as well as getting some exercise. The trail winds along the river and has just enough slope to make your heart pump, and the views along the way help you to forget how much your legs are moving! The best thing for bringing a community together👍🏻"
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,Nice day hike! ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This hike is a nice day hike for beginners. It’s a good combo of up hill and then flat patches. We did go in mid September when most of the flowers were dead which was a bummer. The lake is pretty small and not one that you would swim in. It is a good spot to recharge before the hike down.
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,"Incredible hike, challenging but “doable”",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely incredible hike!  In August, the wild flowers were peaking, the floral smell was incredible and so gorgeous.  I had the “Sound of Music” in my head a lot of the time - as the grassy areas covered in wild flowers, surrounded by mountains was the perfect match to the opening scene in that movie.  We had our athletic 10 and 7 year old boys with us and they did it - some complaining and “Are we there yet” questions but they did it.  It’s not easy.  But it’s amazing!  Note: It was hard to find the trailhead for us... there’s a parking lot at the top of Beehive Basin Rd but we wished we’d have kept going and actually parked right at the trailhead.. we had a long walk to and from our car up hill! "
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,Epic Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beehive Basin Trail in the Gallatin National Forest, Lee Metcalf Wilderness Area of the Spanish Peaks was an outstanding hike, in fact Fox News has named it one of the best 10 hikes in the world! The trail located near the Big Sky Ski Resort gains 1650 feet of elevation over 3.5 miles as it climbs towards Beehive Peak at 10482 feet. Near the top is a beautiful mountain lake and even farther up is another small pond. We trekked near to the point where it takes climbing gear to reach the summit."
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,Beautiful - but snowed in,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We tried hiking this trail on Tuesday May 21st and sunk up to our waist in the snow.  Wasn't able to get out on the trail - but hiked back to the lodge and still got in 5 miles mostly downhill.  Beautiful area.  There is a vault toilet at the trailhead.  The Big Sky community has a very active hiking club and we met the president at one of the local watering holes - he was a neat guy full of information.
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,Wildflowers for days!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I am NOT an experienced hiker and may have been a little over confident doing this trail, but I am so glad I did it. Still sore a few days later, but totally worth it. Since it's an out and back trail I knew we could turn around anytime. We didn't make it the entire route, but did 5 miles round trip, so pretty close. We went last week (mid-July) and the wildflowers and scenery took my breath away (literally-lol). Giant meadows, mountain views...I took my camera and that was a great reason to take lots of breaks. So many beautiful flowers and bees and views to photograph. The bugs were out in full force, so be prepared for that. Overall, a great experience that has encouraged me to get out and hike more! "
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,"Tough, but worth it",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Beehive Basin Trail was a tough climb at over 7000 feet. When the trail leveled out a bit, it was easier going through most of it. The trail was clearly marked at first, but then was unmarked. From our distance calculations on our phones, we went way past the end of the trail. At the time of our hike there was also quite a bit of snow drifts on the trail that made it easy to sink to your knees. The views were spectacular and all the hard climbing was well worth it to see the views."
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,Beautiful hike - go early (for sun and lack of congestion),5.0 of 5 bubbles,Absolutely stunning hike through gorgeous wildflowers and beautiful mountains. Bring/wear bugspray! Go early as it provides much better (though not complete) shade and much fewer people on the trail. Enjoy! 
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,A must do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Get there early for great parking and relative privacy. The hike up is a little strenuous and taking a few breaks to catch our breath was important. Beautiful wildflowers, scenic views of mountains and streams, and limited wildlife. Bring water and wear layers. The weather changed over the four hours up and down the mountain. There was snow and mud at the top - but worth the climb!"
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,Awful Place - Not Worth It,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Over-crowded trail heads and not enough bears. The sun was too hot, and there isn’t anywhere to buy ice. Not worth the drive. Check out Ousel Falls or Taylor Fork for better views and a better day."
Beehive Basin Trail,5.0,Difficult hike for midwesterners!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is labeled moderate, but I’d suggest it is difficult, especially if you are not used to the altitude. It took us 4ish hours to hike the full 6.6 miles. It is quite steep in many places with rocks/boulders to climb on. The top isn’t as stunning as I expected/hoped. "
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,John Muir was right..,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This place is a gem and one of the highlights of our trip. Along with the Congress Trail, we hiked most of this Loop including parts of Log and Huckleberry Meadows. Huge wide open green meadows, some wildflowers, and plenty of wildlife including several mule deer. Parking lot is small, so get there early. If you come to Seki, make sure you make time for this area."
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,Truly the Gem of the Sierras,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Enjoyed our early morning walk on the loop.  We also took the short off shoot trails to see Tharps Log and chimney tree.  We were blessed to see two black bears in the meadow. 
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,Nice and easy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a nice and easy hike; so relaxing and a great way to enjoy and take nature in. We arrived early and there were just a few cars but as we were leaving there were no place to park for people tha were arriving. Bathrooms and picnic area at the head of the trail.  We encounter a bear and a cub (not at the same time) but I could not take any pictures...we just let them be and kept on going our way; but it was cool to see them in a natural habitat roaming free. 
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,This was one of our favorite hikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started out left from the parking lot and were happy we did. Fewer crowds (although it wasn't busy in October) and immediate rewards! It was magical walking through the sequoias, and the kids were in awe. Tharp's Log was a fun rest break to read some history and imagine. Definitely do this loop, it is easy and rewarding. "
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,An easy walk that offers a contrast with the giants,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail is a packed surface, a bit is even paved, so an easy walk to a meadow that stands in stark contrast to the giants all around.  Can easily include Tharp's Log on the walk.  Lots of shade so pleasant in the hottest part of the summer."
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,Bears in Crescent Meadow,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited Crescent Meadow in early June 2014. We got to the Meadow just after 9am. Almost right at the beginning of the meadow we saw two bear cubs playing near the trees 15 - 20 feet from the trail. After a few minutes they started climbing up the trees. They are so cute. Of course, Mama bear was not too far away, another 20 off in the meadow eating grass/ plants. As long as you don't approach the cubs or make loud noise, the bears will leave you alone. The highlight of our Sequoia vacation."
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,Auto Log - one of the stops to make along Crescent Meadow Road,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Crescent Meadow Loop is popular road (and hike) in the Giant Forest of Sequoia National Park. It is open to vehicles during the warmer months of the year. However, you can hake the loop year round. One of interesting attractions to see along this route is Auto Log, a giant sequoia that fell in 1917 and served as an early tourist attraction for tourists who visited during the following decades. "
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,Easy hike & best photos,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a simple, relatively level hike with lots of great scenery. Parking is close to the trail head, and the trail is paved far enough to see Crescent Meadow (which is really more of a lush, green swamp). After that, the loop is a dirt trail that circles the meadow and passes by a number of incredible living Sequoias, as well as Tharp's Log and Chimney Tree. We stopped for a picnic lunch at Tharp's Log, and only saw three other people during our time there (this was a Sunday afternoon).  We found Chimney Tree less impressive than the apparently unnamed tree nearby, which fell down ages ago and now lies in huge segments that go on and on. The trail continues around the far side of Crescent Meadow and leads back to the parking area, where there is a shady picnic area and bathroom facilities (no running water, just pit toilets)."
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,Very Nice,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great walk for people who want to experience nature but don't want to go for a serious hike.  We encountered a rattle snake and a mother bear with her cub so you do have to be aware of your surroundings, but as the rangers will tell you, they won't bother you if you don't bother them.  Great views, relaxing walk and not crowded, but still had enough people around to ""warn"" each other of animals on the trail.  We will definately take this trail again when we come back some day."
Crescent Meadow Loop,4.5,jewel in the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,As described this is a great view in the park and a great contrast to the Sequoias around it. 
Mount Pisgah,4.5,Steep climb but great view,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"As long as you know that it’s a 1.7 mile hike just to the top and you will be walking at an incline for the entire duration and that makes you smile you will be fine. The internet listed this hike as moderate but I disagree and think the incline (even though it is a wide gravel trail that is very well maintained) paired with the distance makes this more of a challenge than “moderate” implies. The views from the trail are amazing all the way up. It was foggy when we hiked so it felt like we were above the clouds. We took the most direct route to the top but hit multiple trails on the way down to see more of the park and it was worth it. If you are confident in your fitness then this is a good hike, otherwise you will probably make it up with a lot of breaks and you will be sore all over for a while."
Mount Pisgah,4.5,Excellent hiking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sure, you can drive for an hour or more and be in the spectacular Cascades, but if you're looking for some great in-town hiking, Mt Pisgah is the place for you. There are sedate gravel paths in the arboretum proper; plus longer, more rugged trails in the surrounding Howard Buford Recreational Area. You can do a strenuous 10 mile circuit without retracing any steps. The views from the peak are terrific."
Mount Pisgah,4.5,Mt. Pisgah... Not Just for Running!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I love to take contemplative walks with friends, and Mt. Pisgah is a great place for that. But when I am wanting a good vigorous Hike... this is my first choice in the Eugene-Springfield area. Trail #1.. the main trail to the summit is 2.8 miles roundtrip, and approximately a 1,050 foot elevation change (summit is 1,531 feet). This makes for a good walk, hike or run even if you are in pretty good physical condition."
Mount Pisgah,4.5,Challenging hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"For starters, the parking fee machine charged me double($10.00).  The trail to the summit is steep. Admittedly, I'm not in great shape, but I'd say this is not a beginner's hike. I recommend walking it in the morning or evening to avoid the summer heat."
Mount Pisgah,4.5,Great getaway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is a$4 parking fee, but absolutely worth it! I came out to visit my adult son and the walk through the park was nice. The escape from work and getting some peace was great. "

Mount Pisgah,4.5,Short hike with a view. Pretty but be careful.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Mt. Pisguah is a great short hike for daily exercise and dog walking. It's so close to Eugene and Springfield that it is a smart choice for a hike with family guests and school groups. It's mostly a gently slope with a nice view of the valley at the top. If the weather is clear, you can see all of the major peaks."
Mount Pisgah,4.5,a great hike for all levels,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great piece of Eugene, awesome hikes for people of all skill levels.  It's a little hot in the middle of the day, the main train has a significant portion that has no shade so bring plenty of water and sunblock.  The view from the top is totally worth it!"
Mount Pisgah,4.5,Because it's there -,3.0 of 5 bubbles,The famous words of George Mallory to describe the reason for climbing Mt. Everest also seem applicable to Mt. Pisgah.  I was born in Eugene almost 50 years ago and for the life of me I don't see the draw of this place.

Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,Super muddy!!!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"SUPER muddy. We hiked in early March, grab a walking stick at the entrance. Wear shoes that can get trashed or heavy duty sandals. It’s a mud mud mud mess all the way down. To get to the bottom of the falls you turn And go up along the ridge to go down. The 1 mile in and 1 mile back trail takes you to the top of the falls. The first falls is great, you can swim in that one too."
Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,Favorite trail on Kauai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of our highlights in Kauai. We downloaded the AllTrails app ahead of time so we didn't miss a couple spots. Respect the neighborhood, only park on the gravel (facing the correct direction). If it's full, come back another day and get there earlier so you're not parking on people's property or add to a mass of people walking through a quiet neighborhood. So many people were so loud when we were packing up and couldn't believe it because of how close they are to residents who probably aren't fans of the crowds coming there. We were just thinking ""well, this is how you piss of locals so they don't like tourists"". We talked to our son about being respectful to the neighbors before we got there and he whispered to us the whole time we were getting ready to hike lol. We got there at 9am and had parking, but by the time we were done at 11am it was packed. We got to the first falls with no one in sight. Don't skip the first falls, it's better than the second. About half way in start listening for water and look for a steep path to the left. Our 4 year old handled it fine with our assistance. After you're done there and continue hiking, you will come to a ""T"", go left to continue on, not right. If you go right you'll end up back at the road. Our favorite spot on the hike was about 3/4 of the way when the trail makes a wide right turn before the final stretch. There was a beautiful, jungle-esque scene with the river. Very refreshing and a perfect spot for lunch. The final falls aren't as much to write home about as the first ones. Yes, they are big, but you can't get a great vantage unless you hike up and around and down (we opted not because of our 4 year old). Still was an amazing hike."
Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,Be cautious and considerate.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"First and foremost, I loved this trail and the falls. They are beautiful, like many sights in Kauai. However, I made a few observations and think it's worth noting. My friend and I are both in our early 30's and hike reguluarly."
Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,Loved the hike & seclusion,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You park in a neighborhood, but people need to be quiet & respect the neighborhood. The entrance is near a telephone pole across from a blue house. Totally worth the hike. Very slippery just be careful with feel placement. We're in great shape at 60&51 so if your younger than this easy. Loved it keep going at fork go left. Stay on main path.  Loved it. "

Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,Please Show Respect At Ho’opi’i Falls,2.0 of 5 bubbles,To Visitors: Please respect the lives of local people living close to these falls. Don’t arrive before 8am. Please park near the trailhead NOT at Kapahi Park. Do not walk down and back up Kapahi Road. A constant stream of visitors doing this causes a huge impact in this small neighborhood and increases local dog barking. Please be considerate. 
Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,Jump in the Water,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The trail has two Falls to swim and enjoy. 
Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,Fun MUDDY hike.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Can you say muddy? Yes it was. But sooo fun. It’s not an easy hike if it has been raining. Maybe in the dryer season. There are 2 falls. The first one in is about 1/2 mile in. You turn off the main trail and head down to the falls. It’s pretty powerful after raining all week. The second falls is a lot farther. The trail ends at the top of the falls. You can Not get to the bottom ( which looked like it would have been fun) there is not a trail to go down. There is a sign posted at a gate saying it is dangerous to try, stay out!! Probably wise advice. If you don’t Like mud, don’t do this after a rain storm. "
Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,Ho'opi'i Falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Park on the dead end street facing south. Left side as you are coming to the trail head. The walk to the falls can be muddy and slippery, so plan to wear decent hiking shoes and be ready to grab branches for stability. "
Ho'opi'i Falls,4.5,"Hard to find, worth the hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The falls are in a neighborhood so please be respectful of the people living there. Don’t follow Apple Maps, it will take you to a dead end street. The trailhead is on Kapahi road on the left side. There is street parking beyond the trailhead. Look for a telephone pole with a sign that says “quiet,” the trailhead has a little cardboard sign with an arrow pointing to the right towards the falls. There are 2 awesome waterfalls, be sure to continue on the trail for the second falls (when the trail comes to a T, take the way to the left). The trail was muddy and slippery as it had just rained, but not too difficult otherwise. Wear a swimsuit but be safe!"
Swiftcurrent Falls,5.0,Swiftcurrent lake boat ride and short hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the swiftcurrent boat ride and then only the short hike before we returned to the lodge. There is a longer hike available with a guide.  With a setting like this, there is no way that a TA review could be anything negative, this is one of the best locations in the park for visual treats.  "
Swiftcurrent Falls,5.0,Picture Perfect!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This may be the easiest five stars we’ve given! We took the combination Swiftcurrent Lake/Lake Josephine boat rides and the guided hike to Grinnell Lake. The whole trip was wonderful! The scenery is unbelievable. The short hike between the lakes is not a problem. In fact, on our trip, family and our guide helped a woman in a wheelchair on this short trek. They probably had to carry her part way since the trail is a little rugged but, nevertheless, she made it. You can easily make the flat hike to Grinnell Lake without the guide. Be sure to take the short side trail to Hidden Falls just before the short suspension bridge (all of five feet above a small creek). We even had a large bull moose pose for us as we got off the return boat on Lake Josephine."
Swiftcurrent Falls,5.0,Trail around the majestic Swiftcurrent Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Swiftcurrent Lake is like a gem set amongst the towering mountain peaks in the Many Glacier area. The views from the Many Glacier Lodge across the lake to Mt Gould and the glacier studded slopes of the surrounding mountains is one that I will not forget. Although there were intermittent showers we decided to take the 2.6 mile Loop Trail around Swiftcurrent Lake. The scenery was magical - sparkling waters of the lake, trail fringed with pine trees, ancient boathouse and docks, wooden bridges over clear streams, cruise boat on the lake, mountains with glaciers and ice sheets and glimpses of the Many Glacier Lodge the whole way. It was an easy walk with no hill climbs but watch out for tree roots across the trail. We also took bear spray as we'd seen a grizzly bear beside the road earlier in the day. The sun came out at the end of the walk giving us some wonderful photo opportunities in this very scenic area."

I can only imagine now, how a first time visitor must feel when they first lay eyes on this stunningly beautiful jewel of a lake... the craggy mountains surrounding it...the historic, huge and yet deep dark rustic lodge nestled right along its shores.  ""Wow""almost seems too short a word for such beauty. "
Swiftcurrent Falls,5.0,Take the boat tour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My husband and I took the long boat tour which went around and across Swiftcurrent.  We then walked across about 1/4 mi to Lake Josephine.  The boat tour continued across that lake and then we hiked about 2 miles to Grinnell Lake which is fed by Grinnell Glacier.  It was well worth the tour and the hike.

Swiftcurrent Falls,5.0,Nice boat ride,4.0 of 5 bubbles,There is a boat that will take you across the lake while someone is narrating the history of the area.  After that you get out of the boat climb a hill about 1/8 of a mile and then down to another boat that takes you on another lake and back and you hike back to the 1st boat.   On the way back we saw a Moose with huge Paddles.  The hike was not as difficult as they say.  Beautiful scenery.

Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,Amazing bike trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed this 6-mile bike loop.  It is hilly/ curvy and moderately challenging as the description/ reviews state, but we thoroughly enjoyed it.  My boys are 10 and 13 years old and both pretty good athletes who work out and play soccer a lot - they were able to handle it.  I would not want to do this bike trail with younger kids as it would be very tough for little ones without geared bikes, or kids or adults who are out of shape.  For us, it was perfect."
Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,Beautiful Trail Ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Our family rented bikes for this trail. It’s stunning but it does take some effort! There are some big hills. I don’t know if it’s something I would do with younger children. Definitely worth the workout but it was also a mild summer day. Snacks and water are essential!
Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,Decent Walk Before Dinner,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I walked a few miles on the Cape Cod Provincelands Bike Trail.  Parking at the Province Lands Visitor Center was free, with substantial parking available.  The asphalt trail is well-maintained.  Unlike the Meadow trail, this trail does have some elevation change, but nothing too severe.  Similar to the Meadow trail, there aren't many sights to be had (at least not on the section we walked) other than surrounding trees."
Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,Hilly and winds around but very scenic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a trail for beginners.  There are a lot of hills and blind turns (you have to slow down).  The visitor center is well worth seeing and a good spot to make the large loop around.  Herring Cove is another good place to start but it's a ride to get to the main trail.  You have to be cautious on this trail and don't go flying on down hills.  Once you get to know the trail, you will enjoy it much more."
Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,P-town Highlight!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I ran the Provincelands Trail.

Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,"Exercise Yes!, Cranberries No!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Last year we picked lots of cranberries along the bike trail, but this year there were hardly any.   I suppose it's because of the drought we've had this year.  So we'll take the 4.6 ounces we were able to find and add them to a bag of berries from Stop & Shop.  "
Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,Great for walking on biking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Walked part of the trail near the Race Point visitors center.  Paths off the road, so safer than biking or walking on the side of a road. Restrooms in back open year-round.  Water fountain in front. "
Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,FREE YOURSELF and take a bike ride on these amazing trails. HEAVEN!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I can't say enough about how you will feel when biking in Provincetown. Just the best feeling I have EVER had on bike trails. The BEST EVER! Good for all levels of bikers. Remember these are dunes; So there are hills and valleys. A great workout. I didn't want it to end.
Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,"Excellent, but several caveats...",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is NOT a rail trail.  The ascent/descent is slightly over 2000 ft which means it is HILLY!  Really; low gear, heart-pumping, hilly.  If you are not at least a regular bike rider, you will be surprised.  In addition, there is sand, water and minor bumps on the paved trail that can make it REALLY challenging.  GO SLOW.  WEAR A HELMET.  No kids younger than 12; really.  The trail requires some thinking and planning and braking--if you do have children in your biking party, let the adults go first.  We actually saw two people being ambulanced out of the trail today:  a 10 year old boy who missed a turn and an older woman who suffered from heat exhaustion.  On the plus side--when riding on the trail toward Herring Cove Beach, it feels like you are riding in the sky.  And when riding in Beech Forest, the dappled light on the paths is cool and lovely.  We are actually going back for a second ride tomorrow, and definitely feel a bit more prepared.  "
Cape Cod Provincelands Trail,5.0,The Most Scenic Bike Ride Ever,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This has been a perennial family favorite since our kids were little. If you have the stamina for the entire loop it is really worth it. Park at the Provincelands parking lot right off of route 6. The trail winds through the woods and then through the dunes to the Visitor's Center. It has restrooms, water, a high deck with a nice view, and other information. There are many absolutely gorgeous views of the ocean. Pack a bathing suit and stop at the beach at Race Point. The trail takes you to Herring Cove Beach, around the rotary at the West End, and then down Commercial Street through downtown PTown. You can then head back to the parking lot, crossing over route 6. The trail is hilly and winding in some parts. Get a map and plan for shorter loops if you aren't up for doing the whole thing. It's all good. "

The 'rules notices' are very long.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,The main downside to the conservation center is that even well-behaved dogs are not allowed there. I accidentally took our dog in.

Springfield Conservation Nature Center,4.5,Turkey on a squirrel feeder,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Nature Center has great trails and exhibits.  It's clean and the staff is friendly and well-informed.  But on this particular morning, my wife and I just went there to see the birds.  There's a viewing room overlooking lots of hanging feeders, some platform feeders, and plenty of places for birds to congregate naturally.  Of course, bird food draws squirrels.  The squirrels try to defeat the baffles (and do), they try to intimidate the birds (sometimes they do), and they provide constant entertainment.  The star performer on our latest visit was neither songbird nor  squirrel, however.  A very large turkey (he went by the name of Tom, I believe) strutted through the feeders, reconnoitered the perimeter, and then returned to the feeders attempting to dominate the well-fed squirrels in his path.  When that task was accomplished, more or less, he flew to the top of a platform feeder and proceeded to clean it.  With his beak.  Completely."
Springfield Conservation Nature Center,4.5,Everyone Should Go,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an amazing place to have a great time in the outdoors.  The Center offers a variety of walking trails that take you through the forest and you can see all kinds of animals such as birds, beavers, deer, and squirrels.  They are up to all kinds of mischief and it is wonderful to watch them.  The trails are well marked and the animals are not shy around humans.  If you respect them they will respect you.  I loved this place as they had bridges, tall trees and shady paths.  It is wonderful for everyone.  You should not come to Springfield without going to see this Center.  It is beautiful!"
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,Beautiful other-worldly hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked about 1.5 hours into the crater and headed back as it was approaching sunset. Beautiful views of the interior of Haleakalā the entire hike. You are hiking down into the crater and is a very easy walk down and much harder to walk out on the way up. Leave more time for the way out. We arrived back to the parking lot for a beautiful sunset above the clouds. 
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,Great Fun !!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clear beautiful day!! Weird,  freakishly beautiful landscape with ever changing colors. Strongly recommend : hiking boots, lots of water, large picnic lunch, down jacket or sweater, warm hat and even hiking poles. We hiked 4 hours total. We live at altitude so it wasn’t super difficult. Stopping for lunch in the middle of nowhere was awesome !! Clouds rolling in at end of hike was so spooky."
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,"Pretty barren the first section, but calm mornings",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Desolate, dusty but in awe of the huge space that we were entering. We hiked it after the sunrise (started about 6:00am and made it to the 1.5 or 2 mi mark before heading back). Any further and later in the day, would require more water and hat since the sun is pretty unforgiving. Steady downhill, which made the return pretty slow. Proud that a group of 60 yos experienced it!   "
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,"Beautiful views, harder than it looks",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Even if you just do a small part of this trail it’s worth it. We walked down for an hour then came back - the closer you get to the cinder cones the more colour you can see in the crater. It’s an easy descent but much harder coming back up as it’s sandy and the ground shifts under your feet. We are quite fit but found it taxing on the way back, in no small part due to the thinner air. Also had to stop a few times to empty sand from my shoes."
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,Surreal vistas - amazing experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of my favourite hikes - allow enough time for the descent into the volcano and notably the trek back up as we saw many a hiker slowly labour up the return journey.  Bring water and sun cover.  The views look so alien and extraterrestrial, as did the flora and fauna (the nenes and silver stars).  A memorable experience!  "
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,"Challenging on the Way Back Up, but Stunning!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a stunning hike with incredible views! Be aware that the hike down is way easier than the hike back up. It can be cold and windy so dress in layers and bring plenty of water. The hike back up is treacherous as it’s easy to get winded because of the thin air. Give yourself plenty of time to make it back up. It took nearly twice as long for the ascent back up the trail, but absolutely worth it!"
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,Incredible day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We’re athletic hikers in our 60’s. Pay attention to how far you want to go down, cuz the coming up is a lot harder! Incredible landscape that changed with every switchback. Bring fleece or raincoat, water, food. Wear hiking boots. Slippery sand!!"
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,Excellent,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Walking down here is eerie to me. First of all you're at 10000 feet so if you use the rule of thumb 1 hour down 2 hours up it is more like 3 because of the altitude unless you live in higher elevations. Make sure you have good shoes and warm clothes and a last worning don't go in the rain.  The landscape is moonlike and pretty barren. We didn't do the entire trek but did enough to know a little of what to expect. We had clear weather but it was cold. Definitely huffed and puffed on the way back up.
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,Amazing Scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail isn't too difficult, but you are at about 9,000 feet so the air is thinner and the temperatures lower so dress warmly.  Was about 45F when I was there and very strong winds so glad I had a warm coat and long pants.  The scenery on this hike is breathtakingly beautiful in a stark way.  So barren but yet so stunning, definitely worth your time."
Sliding Sands Trail,5.0,Beautiful trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The trail itself is pretty easy. It is high altitude so take it slow to avoid becoming too winded. The sights are incredible. The craters and the colors are quite impressive. It's definitely worth your time and effort.

Rattlesnake National Recreation Area,5.0,Beautiful hikes! Be bear aware.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and our daughters (ages 18 & 16) were hiking the Stuart Peak trail. We were coming down at about 8pm, parallel to Spring Creek, and ran straight into a black bear crossing the trail. She had been at the water, and we were within 10-12 feet of her. We froze. She hesitated, and took a good long look at us. Then she looked up the mountain and back at us before deciding we weren't a threat. She continued up the mountain. We turned around and went about 30 yards back up the trail to compose ourselves before continuing back down toward the main trail head. A few minutes later, we continued down the trail again, and ran straight into one of her cubs in the exact same spot. Then we could hear what we thought was a second cub below, coming back up from the creek. They aren't as quiet when they're walking as you'd think.... We heard branches breaking and heavy footsteps. At that point, we hightailed it out of there. Maybe dusk isn't a good hiking time. Thank goodness those weren't this years cubs, or Mama Bear would've been hostile. They were last years cubs, which was obvious by their larger size, so Mama wasn't threatened by us and didn't react to our presence. "
Rattlesnake National Recreation Area,5.0,"Anywhere else, this is a Wilderness.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Rattlesnake Wilderness (our local name is The Snake) is really a misnomer.  None or few rattlesnakes (I have never seen one there & I live at it's edge). Breathtaking.  Closest Wilderness area to a major city anywhere in the world. Elk, Big Horn sheep, Whitetail &/or Mule Deer on almost every trip.  Higher up, even see Goats. Great trails. Busy, at times, but we usually never see anyone on the trail during the week. Can easily overnight, but because of it's closeness & easy access, it is very easy to day hike. Actually, every canyon around Missoula looks similar to the Rattlesnake.  That is one of the reasons why it is so lightly used. This is a great hiking area for families with children.  Our grandchildren are with us on almost every trip. The oldest is almost 4, but they ARE Montana tough. Grizzlies are very rare except at the extreme north end and are so close to humans here that they are more afraid of us than we of them. I live 1/2 mile outside the Snake on a mountain side, so I feel that these observations are accurate and representative of what you will find."
Rattlesnake National Recreation Area,5.0,Short drive from town to awesome hiking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have always loved it that you can drive 4 miles north out of Missoula and in 10-15 minutes be in the Rattlesnake Wilderness.  There is lots of parking and bathrooms at the trailhead. From here you can explore over 73 miles of trails, many of which are multi-use and open to horses, mountain bikers, cross country skiers and hikers. Elevations range from 4200-8600 at the summit of McLeod Peak, but there are trails suitable for all ages and abilities from flat walking along the creek to climbing high up into the mountain lakes and peak tops. Wildlife includes black bear, cougars, deer and elk and birdwatchers can find about 40 different species of birds. "
Rattlesnake National Recreation Area,5.0,"Enjoy hiking, biking or strolling",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A National Recreation and Wilderness area, right out Missoula's back door.  5 minute drive from downtown, and served by city bus line.  Creek flows through, so easy and serene strolling can be enjoyed by all ages.  Cross country skiing, biking, hiking all enjoyabe activities in the area.  Years ago, a friend and I did an overnight hike up to one of the peaks, which had a lake at the base of the peak.  Usually just do short day hikes.  You can still see a couple places where homesteaders lived back in the day.  Open spaces and wilderness areas close to town are so precious; this is a gem to be enjoyed.  Good place for little ones to dabble by the creekside, throw rocks in the water, stretch their legs and blow off steam in a tranquil setting.  Dogs allowed on leash. Maps of trails available at the trailhead."
Rattlesnake National Recreation Area,5.0,Watch out for Mnt. Lions,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rattlesnake is great for hiking and biking. You can find several great day hikes or you can backpack in for an overnight. I spent spent a lot of time exploring Rattlesnake when I lived in Missoula. I saw a mountain lion here close to the parking area, so make some noise while hiking here."
Rattlesnake National Recreation Area,5.0,Hidden Gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Even though Missoulians use the trails here a lot, the Rattlesnake feels like a hidden gem. Great biking, great overnight options for those looking a little off the beaten path. Also perfect for a midday stroll along the creek. Simply beautiful!!"
Rattlesnake National Recreation Area,5.0,Montana's premier urban wilderness,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rattlesnake National Recreation Area, located four miles north of Missoula, Montana, offers 61,000 acres of glaciated topography that form Montana's premier urban wilderness, blending the best of both wilderness and civilization. Established in 1980, the U-shaped Rattlesnake basin is fed by more than 50 small creeks that begin as seeps from springs and melting snowbanks in the upper Wilderness portion of the National Recreation Area. Resting in the more than 30 high mountain lakes, crystal clear water than plunges down waterfalls to hanging valleys separated by sheer headwalls and carpets of sub-alpine fir, lodgepole pine and spruce sloping down to open Douglas fir and ponderosa pine parklands. The non-Wilderness part of the National Recreation Area, devoted to wildlife and recreation, is guarded by the southern flanks of Stuart Peak. From this prominent point north, a knife-edge ridge climbs still higher to the sentinel of the Rattlesnake-remote 8,620-foot McLeod Peak. There are more than 73 miles of hiking trails, many of which are also open to horseback riders, mountain bikers and cross-country skiers. The recreation area also is popular among fishermen, who seek bull trout, cutthroat trout and mountain whitefish. Flora and fauna abound. So does wildlife, including elk, white-tailed deer, mountain goats and grizzly bears. Bird-watchers may find over 40 bird species, including woodpecker, grey owl, ruffed grouse and American dipper. Visitors should exercise caution because grizzly bears, black bear and mountain lions frequent the area. How do you find Rattlesnake National Recreation Area? From I-90 in Missoula, take the Van Buren Street Exit 105 and head north. Van Buren will turn into Rattlesnake Drive. Stay on Rattlesnake Drive for about three miles until you reach the recreation area entrance."
Rattlesnake National Recreation Area,5.0,Easy location for a nice hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stopping in Missoula for the night on a road trip, we saw this hiking trail and used it to stretch out. Nice peaceful walk along a very clear river. The trail maintained the same elevation and had loose stones. Lots of mountain bikers and runners. The trail width is perfect that you don't feel like you have to constantly move over for bikes. Less than 10 minutes to the parking lot from I-90. Lots of parking. The trees provide mostly shade, but there are some really sunny spots."
Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,Awe inspiring!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A wonderful trail with interpretive signage providing info on the trees and the area. A huge tree that fell on a walking bridge is really cool. You can go right into the base of some of these giants. I liked this trail even more than the trails I saw in sequoia national park.  
Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,A Fun Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a gem and open limited hours in the Winter.  On our visit 4-21-15 we were charged a $5.00 a car fee.  It is a donation and you fill out an envelope and place in a box placed at the entrance.  At the bottom of the parking lot are two bathrooms.  You will walk across the street and enter the venue.  The trail offers about 1.3 miles of paved trails and several loop options with interpretive signs. Located on the Western Divide Highway (107).  The grove contains approximately 125 giant sequoias and more than 700 giant sequoias.  Please note,  This trail is ONLY accessible by road during the summer months, weather depending, due to annual closures by Tulare County. The trail is located on Western Divide Highway (107) across the road from Redwood Meadow Campground and Trail of 100 Giants parking area.  The trail is about 45 miles northwest of Kernville, 41 miles southeast of Springville, and 15 miles northeast of California Hot Springs.  When we visited 4/21/15 , construction was going on and we saw no interpretive signing or information of any kind about the tree's on the trail.  It is a fun walk but does not to cater those on a wheelchair because at points on the trial you have to work on the dirt to get around tree's and is not smooth pavement."
Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,Maybe the easiest access to see a quality giant sequoia grove,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We drove over through Kennedy Meadows from Ridgecrest to reach this place. The drive was challenging in spots, with many twists and turns and narrow mountain roads. BE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH GAS!!! There is nowhere to gas up if you are running low. There are a few gas stations in the towns on the edges of the forest, but zero within. There are however plenty of places to stop and rest."
Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,Life changing! But be prepared!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I took my one year old daughter to the trail worried about whether or not I would need to wear her on a hiker backpack. This trail is perfectly paved for a stroller the whole way. No need for a hiker carrier! The trees were INSANELY BEAUTIFUL! 
Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,Alone in the majestic forest,4.0 of 5 bubbles,All the reviews about how easy and accessible this trail is are right.
Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,Trees bigger than you can imagine,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the best places to visit while in Sequoia National Forest. A lot of people confuse the park and forest but I personally like the forest better because you can get right up at the trees and even go inside many of them. The Trail of 100 giants is handicapped accessible for those who may have wheelchairs. There is a paved trail that leads you around the trees where you look up and can't believe how big these trees are. It's incredible! There is a lot of graffiti and trash carved into the trees unfortunately but you can still have a great time. The road is closed whenever there is snow present so be aware for closures but if the cones are up you can still go in and see them. There are some rangers who patrol who may not be happy with you but it depends on who is working and when. If you are at the giants, make sure to stop in and see Peppermint Creek Falls as well."
Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,Beautiful Sequoia trees,5.0 of 5 bubbles,For clarification the Trail of 100 giants is not in Sequoia or Kings Canyon National Parks but is to the south of those great parks in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains on the Great Western Divide highway. My first time to visit the trail with these gigantic Sequoias was recently and I was very impressed. The trails are very nice and there are benches at several places along the trails. There are also nice descriptive plaques along the way. There was even a recently fallen Sequoia tree (or double tree) that fell in 2011 and it is across part of the trail. That was quite interesting. In fact a German tourist was able to video the tree falling and it can be found on Youtube. The visit to the Trail of 100 Giants was great.

Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,It’s not like it used to be ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"   So I first visited this place about 10 years ago, and thought it was beautiful. When I went last week (May 2018), I was a little disappointed. "
Trail of 100 Giants,5.0,"Very beautiful place, but challenge to arrive from LA and find a parking",5.0 of 5 bubbles,We visited the place at summer and had a lot of impressions and beautiful pictures walking along the trail and climbing over the fallen giant sequoias. Highly recommended!
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,Drive up to the parking lot...TRUST ME,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We made the mistake of walking to Cascade Falls from Main Street, which was very strenuous.  It's about a 1/4 mile from Main Street to the park's parking lot and probably a little less than that up to the bridge where you can see the falls.  The whole way it was basically a 45-degree incline, which was very hard on the knees.  Save yourself the effort and just drive to the parking lot and get a much shorter (but still steep) walk.  The trail here also connects to the perimeter trail that encompasses all of Ouray."
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,A don't miss waterfall for those who love waterfalls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is hard to describe how wonderful it was to drive to the parking area and walk up the trail to these falls.  I'll try.  It was cooler than Montrose where we started, and the trees and flowing water made it even more delightful.  "
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,"Pretty, short, uphill hike..",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"While this is not a long hike, just beware that it is an uphill hike.   Plenty of places to stop, if needed.   There are several paths you can take as you near the falls, some have less resistance and are not as uphill.   It's very pretty up there and worth that short hike. They do have signs that say, if there is no water in the cement spill way, there will be no water at the falls....  I made the hike and there was a small water fall, but worth the hike.   I would guess August is not the best time due to low water and heat, but, when in Rome.... LOL"
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,"bBeautiful and impressive sight, visible from nearly anywhere in Ouray!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is actually a beautiful and impressive sight, visible from nearly anywhere in Ouray. To get to the trail that leads to Cascade Falls drive east up 8th Avenue to a dead-ends where you will find a free parking lot. From there it is a short, but moderately steep, ¼ mile walk to the waterfall. "
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,Very beautiful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy walk to see the falls at the bottom. A bit of a hike to get up to them, especially at the midpoint. We did not go all the way up to the top.  The falls are beautiful. At the midpoint of the falls is a rock ledge that you can take right up to the water."
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,Wear good shoes!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"As a member of the local volunteer trail maintenance crew, we often go here to fix up the trail. But being a rocky gorge, it still is a bit of a challenge, and I'm amazed at the high heels and slipper-like shoes I see people wear here. Please be careful where you walk, and PLEASE do not cut the switchbacks! Enjoy!"
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,"Very Steep, but Pretty",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This waterfall is right in town, so no need to drive very far. I'm from Colorado, so I'm use to steep inclines, however this is like fun house level steep. I hate hiking and I'm out of shape, so just getting up the parking lot to view the waterfall was difficult. It's a very tall waterfall and I'm sure during runoff it's probably more impressive."
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,"Short, fun hike for all",5.0 of 5 bubbles,Well worth it. Easy to do after a day spent exploring. About 50 yards up before the incline increases is a bench to sit and enjoy the falls. Climbing up is easy and it was nice to sit on a rock and enjoy the views before we came back down. It only took about 45 minutes. 
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,You can drive up and park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Husband and I did this hike but didn't know we could drive up and park. We walked all the way up from main street and it was a steep hike. If your not in good shape I would recommend you drive up and park if possible. The actual hike itself was not that hard. As we were leaving the trail 3 deer came down off the mountain so we had a nice close encounter with nature too. 
Lower Cascade Trail and Falls,4.5,Short but steep hike but doable.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Enjoyed the challenge. We are old, out of shape, and overweight but made it to the base of the falls."
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,I DOVE into a freakin volcano!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Best thing I did at Crater Lake!  Even with the Covid-19 mandatory mask restrictions (which did make the hike back up, a tad bit uncomfortable!) I would do it again tomorrow!   Be sure to bring a bathing suit and take advantage of the beautiful, crystal clear water.  If you're adventurous, take a dive (or jump) off of the rocky ledge at the lake.  It was wonderful!"
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,"What goes down, must come up -- but its worth it!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Regardless of rather or not you are taking a boat tour, I would recommend hiking this trail! My significant other and I were in moderately good shape when we hiked this trail. Going back up after our boat tour was strenuous, but very doable. However, in mid-August it was packed with people who were not prepared for the hike back up. Many people had chairs/wagons/large bags (which I would not recommend, as there really isn't a good area for just hanging around/picnicking). We also passed lots of people in sandals/flip flops. All of these people were having a very difficult time. If you take the trouble to go all the way to the water, you've got to jump in! I don't care if its cold, do it! You won't regret it (or maybe you will, but I didn't)!"
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,Not that hard,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes, the hike is hard. If you've read a single review you know that.  But how ""hard"" is hard? I was able to drag my 50-year-old size 20 women's bottom with a wonky knee down and up the trail. I took my hiking poles and the down was harder than the up (because of the knee). Took us about 35 min down and about 65 up. Anyone in moderate condition or better can do this trail."
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,Highlight of Crater Lake Trip -- Bring Water Shoes and Googles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I think the visit to Cleetwood Cove was the highlight of our Crater Lake trip.  I was skeptical about going into the water because I don’t love cold water, but it was so refreshing, and I would 100% do it again. Once we got out of the water, the hot sun dried us up almost instantly. "
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,Don't miss this,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not long, but steep trail down to the lake level.  We did not know this ahead of time, but people jump off a particular rock near the bathrooms into the lake.  One guy did so when we were there and the water was brisk given his reaction.  This would be a glorious place to cool off on a hot summer day.  Bring a bathing suit and especially water shoes or sandals since everything is rocky.  I would have waded out onto the rocks if I had had the appropriate footwear. There are many benches to stop and rest on the way up, which was a bit strenuous for us baby boomers.  This was my favorite experience in the park."
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,Worth The Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My best advice is get here early! We arrived at 7:15am, hiked down and had the lake to ourselves for about 30 min. It felt like we were the only 2 people in the world. As we hiked back up around 8:15, there were quite a few others on their way down. And when we got to the top around 8:45, the parking lot was at least 2/3rds full. "
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,Only way to get lakeside,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose this trail because it was nice to see the lake from above, but a different view when you are in the caldera. There were some brave people cliff jumping into the cold water. It was very windy but we still stopped for a picnic. There are very aggressive chipmunks/ground squirrels that are not afraid to jump on you to get your treats! Just beware if you are trying to picnic. During the summer there are boat rides but we were here after that season. "
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,It is a hard climb out,4.0 of 5 bubbles,So the trail down to the lake is mainly covered with lots of switchbacks. The payoff is seeing the lake up close.
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,Tough hike for a cool experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One word...Awesome! The trail is pretty steep and is about a mile down and a mile back up. It is pretty tough coming back up in the sun, but I'm 62 and in reasonable shape and had no problems. The trail itself is in great condition. Our original intent was to take a boat tour...but they were not open for the Summer yet, so we decided to take a swim in the lake instead. It's tough getting down to the water because there are so many rocks, but once we got in the water...wow! So cold and so clear! It felt soooo good. Once we got back to the top of the trail, I wished I could go back down and swim some more. Highly recommended! Tips: Swim by the little shed where people dive off of the rocks. Also, don't do this hike unless you want to swim or take a boat tour as the views are not better than from the rim."
Cleetwood Cove Trail,4.5,Difficult but rewarding,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is obviously an easy hike down and a difficult hike back up.  But it is very much well worth it.  We walked down in the morning and spent a hour or so hanging out by the lake.  Unfortunately the boats were not running so that was all we could do.  The water was amazingly clear and a refreshing feeling on our feet.  If you can make it back up this is definitely something you want to do even if you are not going on the boats.
5 Mile Drive & Trails,5.0,Been doing it for years and will continue,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A great drive I never get tired of. Make sure to stop at all the pull ins and check out the views. You might see eagle or other wildlife on the drive. Bring some binoculars to check out the waterfront and boats.
5 Mile Drive & Trails,5.0,Shaded Drive,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wonderful drive around a nice park. Get out at Defiance Point Park & walk around looking at some of the most amazing flowers you will even see. If you just do the drive it is beautiful enough, but get out at some of the pull offs & look around. Mostly shaded the whole way. Some very large ferns that are worth stopping to look at. "
5 Mile Drive & Trails,5.0,"It's just not the same but then again, what is?",4.0 of 5 bubbles,The five mile drive never really changes but the people who use it do and what used to be a nice scenic slow cruise through a beautiful park has turned into somewhat of a rushed get the heck out of my way racetrack.

5 Mile Drive & Trails,5.0,No cars allowed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A few years ago I would walk the 5-mile drive in preparation of the 3-day breast cancer walk. I've continued to frequent the drive - especially during the mornings when no cars are allowed. The trails are marked well and the vegetation lush. It's a great place to 'get away' from the business of life.

Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,Serious hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Coming from 500ft above sea level, there was definitely some adjusting to the altitude. Rocky terrain most of the way, but well worth the  effort. 10 miles out and back, 7 hours round trip, counting all stops. (I recommend Cathedral “Lake” prior to the final push)"
Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,Absolutely Breathtaking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Trail requires some effort to hike but views can't be beat.   Passby three mountain lakes on the way up.   We went in mid May and I had to stop about 500 feet of summit due to the deep snow.    Hard to believe at this time of year.    
Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,Long & Rocky Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,On July 11th 2018 I had the pleasure of hiking to the summit of Mt. Tallac. My wife and I arrived at the trailhead around 8:47am. We stopped at Camp Richardson to grab a quick bite and to use the restroom before heading to the trailhead. Camp Richardson is about 1/2 mile from the access road to the trailhead. You will see the Baldwin Beach sign and then you will turn opposite of the beach. Parking is very limited at the trailhead so cars are spread all the way along the access road. I am passing along a few tips to hopefully help those who attempt this hike in the future.
Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,Superb Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous views for multiple places along the trail. We couldn't make it to the summit due to deep snow, up to three feet in places. Even if you only go 1 to 1 1/2 miles in you will have some great views."
Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,Tough & totally worth it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Mt Tallac is easily the best hike in the Tahoe area.  From the top, you can almost see all of Lake Tahoe."
Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,One of our favorite Lake Tahoe hikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife, grown daughter and I visited Lake Tahoe in mid September. We like to day hike on our trips and there usually is one big one. On this trip Mt Tallac was the one. It is rated as strenuous but there is a portion that is rated only moderate (that's about my wife's and my limit). That part of the hike goes to two lakes - 1.7 miles to Floating Island Lake and 2.5 to Cathedral Lake for a total of 5 miles, in and out. Maybe that's not a lot for you but its pretty good for us. It is part of the Desolation Wilderness (which is just fun to say). The trail winds up a ridge to the top then follows the spine for a bit. The views are nothing short of fantastic! Lake Tahoe and Fallen Leaf Lake are just magnificent! The trail continues up and down to Floating Island Lake, a small calm lake with mirror reflections of its surroundings. We continued up to Cathedral Lake an even smaller lake that feels almost on top of the world. The trail continues another 2.5 strenuous miles to the summit of Mt. Tallac but we opted out of that part. When we were there quite a few people passed us on their way to the summit yet it felt like we had the place to ourselves most of the time. It was a beautiful hike, certainly worth the effort"
Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,Challenging hike with a great reward.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I went on Labor Day weekend and started at 1:30pm. The trailhead is located about a mile off the main highway, just look for the turnoff marked with a sign. Please note that there are no services at the trailhead such as restrooms or water. This can be a surprisingly difficult hike, so I would recommend sturdy shoes and plenty of water. The trail is 5 miles to the summit with an elevation gain of 3200 feet. The trail is well marked, but rocky in sections, so be careful not to turn an ankle on a loose rock. I would not recommend sandals. For your efforts to reach the summit, you are rewarded with some spectacular views along the way, even within the first 20 minutes on the trail. As a bonus, you will have cell coverage on parts of the trail and at the top, so you can post photos of your adventure in real-time."
Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,It Was a fantastic hike. We went early in the morning and was able to view the sun rise over Fallen Leaf Lake.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Make sure you start early in the morning to be able to stop and take in all the fantastic view that this trail has to offer around every bend. If you are lucky to can catch the breathtaking sights of sunrise over Fallen Leaf Lake. There are two beautiful small  lakes along trail that demand a closer look and of course photo opportunities. Make sure to take snacks and plenty of water and maybe a small lunch. The last leg of the trail is  strenuous so stop to catch your breath and don't over do it. Stop at every opportunity to take in the beautiful views and take pictures. And the view from the top is breathtaking. You will not regret taking this hike.
Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,Tough brutal hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Read all posts and people are either lying or super human athletes. I have hiked all of Zion and Bryce and this trail is way harder.

Mt. Tallac Trail,4.5,Still a lot of snow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hike to the top is impossible at 6/7/2017 due to a lot of snow. Hike to floating island lake is perfect, towards cathedral lake very very hard because you have no clue where the path is because of all the snow! With good gps it is managable! Views are mesmerizing from the half frozen cathedral lake. Onwards to the top is covered in 3-6 fit of snow and very dangerous. We met some people who tried but were not succesfull!"
Bass Lake,5.0,A Beautiful Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I enjoyed an absolutely beautiful walk strolling around Bass Lake.  It was obviously a popular spot, as many folks were doing the same - many with dogs in hand.  There are multiple trails through the woods - though we didn't give them a try, as my 3 lower extremity replaced joints don't particularly like that kind of hiking.  The walk around the beautiful lake is flat, much easier for me to handle."
Bass Lake,5.0,A refreshing walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This 0.9 mile walk around Bass Lake is great for the entire family.  You can take it at a leisurely pace or run around the level path.

Bass Lake,5.0,Wonderful place to walk!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The walk around Bass Lake is about .9 of a mile on a flat unpaved surface. There are numerous benches around the path for those who need to rest.  There are restrooms available.  The lake is surrounded by trees and there is usually a nice breeze.  It is my favorite place to walk when in Blowing Rock.  My husband likes to hike the trails that branch off from the lake trail.
Bass Lake,5.0,Must Do!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Def worth a trip is you’re nearby! I feel like it’s an underrated gem that mostly locals only know about. I just did the 0.9 mile loop trail around the lake and it was beautiful. Many others do do here as well.
Bass Lake,5.0,Relaxing walk around the lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Bass lake sits below the Moses Cone house in Blowing Rock. You can walk the path surrounding the lake. The pathway is smooth and flat and an easy walk for most. Beautiful place to relax and if more adventuresome you can hike the paths UP to the house. Great place to visit.
Bass Lake,5.0,Beautifu,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"With skies threatening rain one morning, we opted for a short walk around Bass Lake."
Bass Lake,5.0,Beautiful and serene,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice and relaxing experience. Stopped in for an hour or so and got a good parking spot in the shade.  There were restrooms but I never used them.  I sat on the bench in front if the Lillie pads, due to a sore knee,  while my spouse/pup walked around the lake.  I enjoyed the lake and got some great pictures!  It was a nice place and will definitely visit again."
Bass Lake,5.0,Beautiful ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy, beautiful place to walk around the lake. There’s also trails that where carriage trails years ago that you can walk. (we didn’t this day but, next time) We also saw a group of horse back riders not sure how that came about. "
Bass Lake,5.0,Beautiful Lake!  Great place to take a walk!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We like to come and walk around the lake.  I always take pictures of my son here.  It makes for a beautiful backdrop.  This is a dog friendly place.  Highly recommended for fishing, exercising, or taking a leisurely walk."
Bass Lake,5.0,Beautiful park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,You can walk all around the lake. It’s only about a mile hike. Very beautiful! We took our dogs. They really enjoyed the walk. There were ducks all over. A lot of dog poop on the trail.  I was surprised because they have doggy bag stations.
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,Nice place,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Interesting history. Trail is crushed limestone. Started in Sparta and rode generally uphill to the first tunnel (I think it was called Tunnel #3). Cool small towns along the way.
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,Tunnel Trail in the Fall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So great to couple the outdoors with a train history lesson. We started near Tunnel 3, our favorite and hiked the trail."
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,Unique rail trail experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a different bike ride experience. I was not able to do the whole thing since I did an out and back, but I started at Sparta (you can buy the trail pass at the chamber of commerce), went to Wilton, where I had a good and affordable lunch, and then headed back. This let me do tunnels 2 and 3. Tunnel 3 was much different than I expected- very long and wet. It wasn’t hot out, but I am sure it would be fantastic on a hot day. It seemed to be slightly more uphill from Sparta than to Sparta, so if you are planning on doing only one way, probably starting in Elroy is the way to go. There are toilets in Wilton and Norwalk as well as one close to Tunnel 3 between the tunnel and Sparta. I think it is about 7 or so miles between the campground bathroom/trailhead and the first bathroom, so that is something to keep in mind.  Norwalk also had a campground, so there are ample camping areas for people looking to do that."
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,Elroy bike trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I only made it to the first tunnel and back to Elroy, after starting out on the wrong trail (Omaha) by mistake- check your GPS!  It's a nice ride. I didn't find it bumpy as some others have mentioned, but I have a fat tire bike. "
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,Some great biking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great bike ride from Sparta through tunnels 3 and 2. Ate at a nice little Mexican stand.  Trails were well maintained. 2nd day started from Elroy north. Trail not as well maintained and bridge was out about 3 miles north of Elroy.
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,Great Biking ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Starting in Sparta, I got an early start on the Elroy-Sparta trail. About 9 miles down the trail, I encountered tunnel 3 which is approximately 3/4 miles in length. Signage at the tunnel entrance recommends/suggests that bikes must be walked in the tunnel. Unless your riding a three wheeled recumbent, I'm not certain you could successfully navigate this tunnel by riding. The surface is a bit uneven, wet, and slippery. You will get wet from dripping water in this tunnel. Also, make certain your bike light is in proper working order (you're going to need it in the tunnels). Due to previous weather conditions, the exit of this tunnel was a bit tricky if not messy. The trail was a bit muddy so you need to properly navigate the first one hundred feet or so once exiting the tunnel. "
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,Great ride and wonderful towns!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This 33 mile ride is a great one - good for beginners and experienced cyclists.  Our suggestion is to catch a shuttle at 8:30 am at Speed's in Sparta, and go to Elroy to start the trip.  Shuttle was $50 for two of us and our bikes, and allowed us to ride the entire trail.  Good flashlights and/or headlamps a must!!!!"
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,Great Bicycle Ride in the Wisconsin Countryside,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I took on the challenge to do a round trip bicycle trip on the Elroy-Sparta bicycle trail, about a 64 mile round trip.  We did complete the trip and had a great time on this trail.  We started in Elroy and proceeded to Sparta and back.  The trail meanders its way in the Wisconsin countryside with some nice views of rolling hills and forested areas.  The trail is for the most part flat, but there is a consistent, noticeable upward grade for a couple of miles before each of the three tunnels that will definitely slow you down a little and make you work.  On the plus side, once you come out of a tunnel you have a couple of miles of downhill ride.  The trail is crushed limestone and is well maintained and plenty wide for passing and riding side by side.  "
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,State needs to pay attention to this trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We have been going on and off to this trail for over thirty years.  Every year a group from our home town visits this trail in late June.  The trail is an excellent ride, through quaint towns and neat tunnels.  The trail was in the worst condition we have ever seen it.  It is growing narrow in places, so people with twin recumbent bikes and trailers are closer together when passing.  There were more washouts that we have ever seen, in some places we felt it was dangerous.  Also, much more debris on trail than we have ever seen.  It may be time to relayer limestone, as in places there is much more mud on trail than normal. The state needs to pay some serious attention to this trail to keep this jewel in central WI in peoples minds.  For the first time ever our group is thinking about going somewhere else -what a shame."
Elroy-Sparta State Trail,5.0,All bikers must experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is bike riding experience you can't pass up!  Historical limestone trails of 3% railway grade hills makes this a ride for all ages.  Suggest riding west to east as is still more ""downhill"" in this direction.   We stayed in Sparta and hooked up with bike service that shuttled us with bikes to Elroy and back to Sparta. Approximately 38 miles with few areas to stop on the way.  Shuttle driver points out this for you.  We met and saw many people of all ages from all over the world.  You do need a light source when you go through the rail tunnels and signs ask you to walk bikes through because wet limestone is slippery.  And still more trails we didnt ride east of Sparta! World wide known trails! !"
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,Okay option for getting around Coeur d'Alene (CDA) by bike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although I'm sure the views would be fabulous, we decided to skip taking on the hill leaving Higgen's Point and got on the trail near Tony's On The Lake to bike into CDA. The ride along the lake is beautiful, but there are many unprotected sections of riding the path parallel to the rode and once past the golf resort the trail meanders through neighborhoods on the street until you get to McEuen Park. This park is lovely and you can hop off on any street to Sherman Ave. to check out the shops and restaurants. We rode on to City Park to listen to live music at the bandshell, and to check out the historically restored carousel. We did a little people watching from the benches along the boardwalk at the beach and rode north to where the trail goes under Hwy 95. The trail is quite busy through the parks and we had to carefully dodge pedestrians. The North Idaho Centennial Trail around CDA and the lake is a busy shared pathway and it serves its purpose, but we much preferred the scenic, less crowded Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes between Harrison and Plummer Point."
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,Once on the trail it's lovely,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"When I initially read about the trail I was excited. However be aware that the trail portion that goes through CDA town is a narrow single shared bike lane on one side of the road (not a pathway at that point) therefore there are cars and a few traffic signs to obey. The road the bike lane is on wasn't very busy but I thought it would be a continuous uninterrupted pathway system. I road from town to Higgen's Point and then tried to connect from McEuen Park to pathway along the Spokane River. The signage disappeared or was very confusing in McEuen park on how to connect back to the trail. It was also Ironman weekend so there was more people in McEuen park which didn't help. Never found the way out of there toward the river so turned around.  The pathway out towards Higgen's Point was great, lots of rest stops a few outhouses. But only average for me as the ""path"" through town isn't a trail it's a bike lane."
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,Loved this!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful bike trail that runs through the heart of Coeur d'Alene.  We picked it up in the heart of downtown and rode all the way to the south end.  (About 15 miles round trip).   There is a section where you have to go through a neighborhood but it's well marked and easy to follow.   Loved the scenic views.   (Warning:  There are some hills, so be prepared). Well worth it though, and you can rent bikes in town.  We rented ours from Coeur d'Alene Bike Company, which is about one block off the trail. "
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,Grab a bike and enjoy the views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rented a couple of bikes and spent a few hours riding the Centennial Trail.  For the most part, the trail is smooth and offers many stops along the way to stop and rest.  We headed east out of town.  The trail also goes west towards Spokane but were told going east was by far much more scenic.  There are some parts when you are in town can be a bit confusing if you are still on the trail or not.  There was some road construction which may have been part of the problem.  There are also restrooms along the way, which was nice to have.  Grab a bike and enjoy the views."
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,An Amazing place to recreate!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Coeur D'alene is simply one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen.  If you are any kind of athlete, enjoy the outdoors, and being surrounded by beauty, this is the place for you.  The paved trail systems here are perfect, and run right along the lake.  You can bike, hike, or jog on them- I don't know of any other place with such amazing trails!"
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,Scenic Trail Accessible to Everyone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a wonderful paved trail and was one of the main attractions that brought us to Coeur d'Alene in July. We stayed at the Hampton Inn right beside the trail on the northwest side of Lake Coeur d'Alene and walked on the trail into downtown (2.5 miles one-way). The trail skirts the Spokane River and the lake, and goes through the city parks and beach where there were restrooms, benches, bike-repair stands and restaurants. There are some educational signs along the way with information about the area, and the trail was clean and well-maintained when we visited. It also passes the Coeur d'Alene Resort which offers boat cruises and rentals, the Museum of North Idaho, and the Convention and Visitor Center. It's possible to rent a bicycle if you don't have your own. We made a day of it and explored the lake front, then detoured a couple of blocks off the trail on our way back to visit the site of historic Fort Sherman on the campus of North Idaho College. I would love to return and explore more of the trail on the east side of Coeur d'Alene."
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,Great trail: Mile 13-23,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to ride the section of trail along Lake Coeur d’Alene and so glad we did. The vistas are spectacular and it was good to ride the entire waterfront from the Spokane river, through town and out to Higgins Point. First of all try to get a trail map from the info center in town. To get to the trailhead we drove I-90 west for a short distance then Exit 11 to Seltice Way. It’s very easy and you will see the parking lot/trail head. We headed in the direction of town on the marked trail but it soon ended. You will have to make your way through the Riverstone Park community to find where the trail is along the river. *this is unmarked* Otherwise take a moment to orient yourself at the parking lot.  As you face the trail take the path to the left or away from town. It soon branches to north for Prairie Trail, west for the trail towards Spokane and south leading to the river and Higgins Point. We loved riding this section of the trail, there is a climb at about mile 20 but you get to coast to the point."
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,Not what we expected from the reviews,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"While I appreciate any effort to build and maintain bike paths, this trail was not what we expected.  Maybe we were spoiled by the two previous days on the Trail of the Coeur d' Alenes, which was fun and beautiful.  The North Idaho Centennial Trail left us lost in a couple of places.  A few more signs when the trail goes onto residential streets would be helpful.  We got out the iPhone a couple of times, trying to find our way.  We did better on the way back, once we were familiar with the trail.  I would definitely not take kids on this trail.  "
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,Fantastic Bike Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I thoughly enjoyed these trails. They have pulled up miles and miles of railway tracks, paved it over and created  a bike trail that anyone can manage. The  trails meander through towns, through mountain valleys, along rivers, and over train bridges. It's an easy, relaxing ride through a beatiful countryside. Trails are very well marked with lots of rest stops, restrooms, and parks along the way."
North Idaho Centennial Trail,4.5,You'll love the views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We ride from our house in Northwest Coeur d'Alene down rails to trails routes which cross the Centennial Trail near Riverstone then goes along the Spokane river, past the North Idaho College and beach, through the city park, past the Coeur d'Alene Resort and the just-completed renovation of McEuen Park, through the older part of town to Lake Coeur d'Alene Drive, then along the lake for several miles to it's end point near Higgens Point.  Lots of places to stop and picnic or take a picture. Also, places to eat along the way including our favorite, Bakery-by-the-Lake on Front Ave. Many athletes train here for the Coeur d'Alene Ironman Race held the last Sunday in June. You can spend the whole day taking in the sites along the way or just go for a quick ride."
Hawksbill Crag,5.0,Amazing experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hawksbill Crag is an amazing, bucket list kind of hiking experience. The hike itself is up and down a handful of ravines and across the bluff summit. It's rocky, steep in some areas and tree roots abound across the trail. A good pair of hiking boots makes for an moderately easy trek. The 6 mile drive up the mountain to the trail head can be dicey. The 1st 1/3 mile was a struggle for my front wheel drive Jetta but she pulled herself up the steep, loose rocked incline with tires spinning! After that 1st sketchy stretch it was all pot holes on gravel until the top. It's all worth it! Bring a backpack for water and a picnic lunch or a hearty snack with an incredible view and energy to hike back to your car."
Hawksbill Crag,5.0,"Great views, moderate hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked Whittaker’s point on a Saturday morning.  Got there around 8:45 am and it wasn’t too crowded then.  Just a few cars in the parking lot.  When we left, it was around 11 am, and it was definitely getting crowded.  The last bit of the drive up here is a 6 mile rough drive up a bumpy country road, took a while to drive up..  We were in a small SUV and did ok.   The hike is moderate, and is about 1.5 miles to the Hawk’s Bill Crag.  Beautiful views.  We stayed a while up there and got some great photos.  Hike back seemed a but harder as it had more up hill hiking than the way out.  Be sure to bring water and a snack.  Also need good hiking shoes and be careful.  The paths had lots of rocks and tree roots.  We enjoyed this hike and our dog did too!"
Hawksbill Crag,5.0,Just beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I’d seen the pictures for years and made sure to make this hike on this trip to AK. It was a cool day for late August, and we went on a weekday, so there was pretty low foot traffic.  It’s a super tricky road to get there, so be prepared for that. We’ve done all levels of hiking and this is a nice moderate hike. Very easy parts and some nice steep parts. Our teenager had to stop and chill at every vista, which there are several along the way, which is great. This is a dog friendly hike and our slightly overweight beagle did just fine. Loved it and highly recommend. "
Hawksbill Crag,5.0,Moderate hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hike!  Very picturesque!  I would classify it closer to a moderate hike with the impressive tree roots and medium sized rocks on the trail and with that are a couple steep inclines and descents. Need to keep your eyes down on the path at all times. I saw a lot of senior citizens like us on the trail. Several hikers with walking sticks. Good place to have them.

Hawksbill Crag,5.0,2.9 mile hike but worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When you turn on the county road, it is SUPER rough.  We were in my husbands 2500 dodge and didn’t have any problems with the 6 mile county road other than the roughness.  After a mile the road levels out and gets a bit smoother.  The trail isn’t horribly difficult, coming back is harder than getting to the Crag.   Both me and my husband are out of shape and we made it through.  "
Hawksbill Crag,5.0,Great view!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The gravel road on the way up was enough to make a person have second thoughts! Once you get there, you will find plenty of parking. The hike is downhill and moderately challenging with rocks, roots and crossing springs."
Hawksbill Crag,5.0,Stunning view from a rock overhang.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous hike near Ponca and Jasper, AR.  Also called Whitaker Point.  Terrains is very rocky but, usually not too steep.  Must drive about 20 minutes on a gravel country road to get there.   It took us one hour to get to the cliff overlook and another hour to return to the car.  Dogs are allowed on a leash and there were plenty of other people on the trail."
Hawksbill Crag,5.0,"Great little hike, once you get there.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Google Maps got us close- it has us turn down a dead end road (the road was gated off). I was a bit confused, but decided to back up (just a 50 feet or so) to get back on the main road I came in on, and contnued in the same direction I was heading, and just 50 feet later was the parking lot. The path starts to the left of the big stone across the road. It took us about 30 minutes to get there, it is a rocky path in a lot of spots, turned my ankle a couple of times. We got there about 9:30am (it was a Wednesday), and there was nobody on the trail, so we had the view all to ourselves. Beautiful morning indeed."

Bump and Grind Trail,4.5,Desert Hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were looking for a Palm Desert hike that we could complete in a few hours, and the Bump and Grind Trail seemed to fit the bill. It was near our resort, had good reviews, and was free. We parked on the road near the trailhead, located behind the Desert Crossing Shopping Center. Following signs that said Mike Schuler Trail to the lower Bump and Grind, we headed right as the left slope appeared quite steep. You can’t get lost. The trail is well-marked and well-trafficked. Overall, I found this desert hike barren (no wildflowers, no vegetation) and not very scenic until we got near the top. We did enjoy the views of Larry Ellison’s private estate and golf course Porcupine Creek, as well as beautiful Palm Desert below. A local advised that part of the trail (the left steep section) was closed Feb 1 – April 30 due to the bighorn sheep mating season. We decided to retrace our steps back and anyway, we had enough of the grind by this time. It was hot and there is no shade. Bring water. Leave the kids at home unless they are good little hikers because there are narrow sections with steep drops and slippery gravel/rocks. We did not have trekking poles, but they might come in handy for the very steep section if you come down that way."
Bump and Grind Trail,4.5,"Great hike, but not as easy as they say",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike offers terrific views of the valley and a great sense of accomplishment. The guidebooks say it is ""moderately-challenging""4.4 miles, but it is very hilly, and you should take it clockwise. As this was our first time, we accidentally went counter-clockwise, so we had a very slow ascent that finished with a very rapid and challenging descent. Frankly, it isn't for the faint of heart."

Bump and Grind Trail,4.5,"A feat of accomplishment, great views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It took us 2 hours 15 minutes to complete the trail loop. We hiked counterclockwise and if I hiked it again, I would go clockwise. The ending part of the trail coming down was quite treacherous. I should have heeded the advice of others in the reviews that said go clockwise. It is a 4 mile hike and my legs were fatigued. We went early in the morning on a weekday and that was a good time to hike. If you love hiking, this trail is a feat of accomplishment!"

I like many of them so I'll pick a favorite--the hike to Tomales Point. It's long, nearly eight miles round-trip. The trail starts at the Pierce Point Ranch, a group of historic buildings worth exploring. As you proceed north, you have a view of both the Pacific Ocean and Tomales Bay. Along the way, you may well see elk, deer, and even a bobcat or a coyote. I have been there early in the year and observed migrating gray whales. There is no bad season--hiking in a light rain or mist, as long as you have raingear, is pleasant and peaceful. "
Billy Goat Trail,4.5,"If you survive, it is great",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the most deadly trails in the U.S. because ordinary hikers try it without training, experience or water. In the Summer it can get really hot, and when you are half way in it is a long way out to get out - people die every year of heat stroke and/or dehydration.  If you are a good hiker, good at rock climbing, and very careful, and no one in the crowd ahead of you does anything stupid to knock you down, this can be a very fun trail with great views.  If not, you may die.  There is limited cell phone coverage, and medvac requires a helicopter and thus any rescue is very slow.  Note that only parts of the trail are dangerous, so get a map to show you what you may want to avoid (and help you stay on the trail)."

Follow the towpath & canal northwest about 1,500’ where it meets the south end of Widewater Lake.  Proceed on the towpath for another 500’ looking left for the start of the Billy Goat Trail.  The trial heads west 440’ to terrific views of the Potomac and up and down the cliffs that define the waterway. It’s another 1.4 miles from here to where the trail once again joins the towpath. From there it’s just 1,500’ to the trail on the left that will take you to spectacular views of the dramatic Great Falls and cascades (The views from MD are much better than from the VA side.) From the head of the overlook trail go another 1,600’ up the towpath to the Great Falls Tavern and Visitors Center with restrooms and drinking fountains at the small white building just beyond. There is a nearby concession stand with picnic tables in the shade. The visitors center has great static displays but the informative movie shown in the back room of the Tavern is especially informative….DON’T MISS IT! Composed of movie clips from 1917 it showed scenes of the operation of the 180 miles of the C&O canal from Cumberland to Washington. It mades you feel like you had experienced its entire length."
Billy Goat Trail,4.5,Best Hike on the East Coast.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Billy Goat Trail is along the Maryland side of the Potomac River in the Cand O National Park, Great Falls MD, just outside the beltway. We usually park in the park (take MacArthur Blvd to the very end), pay the $5 and then you get bathrooms, easy parking and if you are lucky the grill is open. "
Billy Goat Trail,4.5,Truly Beautiful!  So close to the city - amazing - you will feel like it is far away,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Challenging trail - climbing over the rocks.  But most is not difficult and the views are outstanding!  Highly recommend.  Go early - this trail gets crowded.  The $10 fee is only payable via debit/credit.
Billy Goat Trail,4.5,Hike well worth doing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Billy Goat Trail along the Potomac River has three sections, A,B and C. Access is from the C&O Canal Tow Path. I have done all three sections but did section C yesterday. Section C allows dogs and is the closest section to DC. Parking is easier at Carderock for this section than trying to park across from Old Anglers Inn, parking there on a nice day is terrible any time after 10 am. Section C also has fewer hikers, we saw only 6 people and you hike by Carderock climbing area where most nice days someone is climbing. The hike took 2-3 hours to complete and is relatively flat and easy. Section A and B are a bit more challenging and you need to be careful! I recommend taking a picnic lunch and eating on the shady boulders over looking the slow moving river."
Billy Goat Trail,4.5,Fun Trail outside DC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Billy Goat Trail is a series of trails along the Potomac River on the Maryland side in Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historic Park. As the name suggests, you need to be part mountain goat to hike this trail! There are actually three Billy Goat Trails, but I've only done Section A. This section starts from the towpath at the stop gate between locks 16 and 17, about a mile south of the Great Falls Tavern. The trail heads out onto Bear Island and runs along the rocky cliffs above the Potomac River in Mather Gorge. Initially, the trail is pretty flat and easy, though the entire trail is very rocky. Good hiking boots with ankle support are recommended. As you progress down the gorge, the trail becomes more difficult with lots of climbing and scrambling, up over, around, and under huge rocks and boulders. At one point roughly in the middle, you will have to climb 30 to 40 feet up a cliff. There's a big crack down the middle to give you a foothold and it's not really as hard as it sounds - no ropes or harness required, but not recommended for those with a fear of heights. After the cliff, you'll come down to river level at Purplehorse Beach with great views of the river and gorge. Soon, the trail loops back around and ends at the towpath near Widewater. Although I've never done them, I understand that Sections B and C are much easier. Section A, however, is great fun, albeit somewhat challenging. I would consider it similar to Old Rag in Shenandoah for comparison. If you're in good shape, not afraid of heights, and used to rock scrambling, the Billy Goat Trail is a great adventure, just 15 miles outside Washington, DC."
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,Disappointing,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went for a family lunch at the lodge on 3/17/2021. The food and service was really good, however the dining was very cold and uncomfortable. When asked to the waitress to have the temperature raised she done so promptly and it was starting to get comfortable. Then her boss had the temperature turned back down. When we complained to her boss, she gave a smart remark that we should just come back to the kitchen where it was warm. Her next remark was that we should set somewhere else, the entire dining room was freezing and everyone was miserable. The guest and tax payers deserve better treatment."
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,"Christmas dinner promised, just not for hotel guests.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hotel guests we’re supposedly to be told at 10:30am to sign up for “Christmas Feast”.  None were told, even by our 3rd day at the lodge. Supposedly it was an oversight. We came back from a two hour hike to find the entire town of Mena sitting in the lodge waiting for tables. We told the host we were hotel guests and had just hiked two hours and that meant nothing to her. We were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait. Restaurants down the mountain were closed for Christmas. We ate trail mix and had coffee for our highly anticipated Christmas dinner. With very few people actually staying at the lodge over Christmas, it seems like they would have seated us instead of putting us in line with the townspeople."
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,small park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is one of the smaller parks in AR.  It is also a bit random.  There is a train engine on display and there is a putt putt course.  There is also a large lodge and RV spots.  We were touring around the state of AR and wanted to come here because it is the second highest park in the state.  We talked to a nice park ranger that explained to us in detail why no state park in AR charges and entry fee.  The first day we were there it was a bit overcast so the views were not that great.  The second day it cleared and we were able to see for a long distance.  We didn't go into the lodge because of COVID and mostly we did the short trails at this park.  I also love the unique signs each state park has at their entrances.  It wasn't our favorite we visited but still a nice stop. I am sure once COVID is over the putt putt will reopen.
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,Bathrooms unclean and have a lot of insects,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We like to go to Queen Wilhelmina State Park to camp with our class B motor home at least 4 times a year...We enjoy going to the restaurant because the food is alway well prepared and very good...On the downside the restrooms at the campground are not very clean and usually have a lot of insects in them..The lodge is very nice there..I am disappoint that more effort is not made to keep the bathrooms in the RV park cleaner.
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,eh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is abeautiful area. That said our visit was mediocre. The room was clean, but the window had inside smears- not good for a scenic destination. We did visit during Covid-19. The were social distancing but a couple was allowed entrance without mask.  My food tasted good but all seemed to be factory food from Sam's. Partners entree she said appeared freezer burnt.  It would have been nice to have flavors of the region. This sas factory food with a view. The service was poor."
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,Wonderful experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,After spending the day enjoying the remarkable views from the vistas on the National Scenic Byway we spent 2 nights at the lodge in the Queen Wilhelmina State Park. The lodge was very comfortable and the rooms quiet. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming. The food in the restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced. We spent a day walking the trails around the state park. They were all easy to follow and well maintained. I would highly recommend  staying at the lodge. The rooms were redone in 2015 and were very modern. The views from the lodge and state park were spectacular. The rooms did not have a microwave which was somewhat inconvenient.  The putt putt golf course and mini train were not open but we didn't care.
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,Happy and loved the lodge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My on-line reservation was not found but we were luckily accommodated, with our dog for 2 nights. The lodge is isolated but we never left. We hiked trails and ate in the restaurant. The room with a view was nice, clean and the bed was comfortable. It's a little dark if you venture out with your dog in the night so take a flash light and room key to gain entry through the back door.  The employees were great and accomodating too. It was windy so we only sat in the rocking chairs on the porch for a few minutes.  Hike all the trails! "
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,Beautiful views and vistas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Staying in Mt Ida Arkansas we saw Mena Ar. on our atlas and had no idea what was in store for us.  Located near the base of Rich Mountain it is a very quaint town that I want to go back and stay over night and explore.  After visiting the museum & welcome center (old train depot) we saw a sign for the Talimena Scenic Byway.  As you go up the mountain there are vistas with truly awesome views of the surrounding countryside.  About 13 miles up (I think) you will encounter Queen Wilhelmina State Park.  There is a very nice lodge with restaurant as well as camping and RV sites.  If you continue on you will go in Oklahoma (we did not travel far before turning around).  The whole area is surrounded by the Quachita National Forest which by itself is beautiful and you could spend days exploring that also.  A must do if you are in the area.
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,Beautiful views here,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We only visited the lodge area here during our drive along the Talimena Scenic Byway. We never made it into the lodge nor campground as we were there for the view. And what a view it was! The mountain vistas and valley views were amazing. We decided to have a picnic there to enjoy it just a while longer. There were some trails such as Lovers Leap but we didn't try those.
Queen Wilhelmina State Park,4.5,Beautiful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This state park is amazing! The views are breathtaking. There are plenty of camping sites. The train was a hit with my kids and we loved walking down the trails. Our favorite was the old cemetery and reading about the history of the area. The house on the property was interesting and my kids came up with all kinds of stories for that. We will definitely be back. 
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,Not good for little kids,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took this hike with our 2,3,5,7 year olds and 70,75 year old parents because of the positive reviews about hiking with kids. I’m guessing a subset of us got halfway, the rest maybe 3/5 of that. It was steeper than I expected. The mud was totally navigable (June), and only on the flat parts so it was fine going back down. It was definitely in the jungle, so that was really cool, got to hear the birds, feel the life all around us. A couple folks told us they couldn’t find the waterfall at the end, I’m sure it’s a great hike if you don’t have really young or old ones hiking, but this was a bit of a flop for us. Still very grateful to have access and for maintenance!"
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,Great jungle views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy trail, with some great jungle views.  Make sure you go PAST the picnic tables, as the trail continues to the right.  The best views are beyond the picnic tables, and it won't be very far (less than half a mile) until you see the gorgeous views.  You'll also pass a small waterfall.  The trail ends at the bridge, but you can continue on if you like.  I turned around there.  Yes, it can get muddy, and I went right after it rained.  Don't let that stop you though, it's worth it."
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,Would do again. Don’t miss the waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful hike with a waterfall 1/2 mile past the picnic tables. Gradual easy ascent with a fair amount of mud!  Great vistas. Bring good hiking boots and sticks. Rated easy which this 63 year old agrees with
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,Worth Doing,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It's a lovely walk through the trees and vegetation.  I was looking for something a little less strenuous after doing several other hikes and this one was a nice change of pace.
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,My Favorite Trail on Kauai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I love to hike and the Kuilau trail is my overall favorite. There are more scenic ones; there are more dramatic ones; but for a good workout, nice wide safe trail, great views, convenience - Kuilau comes out on top. I take my dog up there all the time. My tips are bring water, shoes that can get muddy and maybe even a picnic. Here's a helpful tip too: in Hawaii we DON'T SIT ON PICNIC TABLES! It's an old school thing, but basically who wants to eat off something someone sat on...also park over by the river instead of at the base of the trail - your stuff will be safer."
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,Terrific scenery all around,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Kuilau Ridge Trail is a terrific two-mile rainforest hike on Kauai, Hawaii.  Both the sounds and the scenery on this trail are unforgettable.  It's wide and easy to navigate, though it may be a little too slippery and muddy after a rain.  The trail took us through a fantastic landscape with awesome vegetation and sweeping views of lush valleys, Mount Waialeale and the Makeleha Mountain Range. The views were breathtaking and birdsongs complemented the lush tropical environment.  "
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,Warning!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Kuilau Ridge is one of our favorite hikes on this side of the Island. We got about 15 minutes up the trail and it was blocked by a very large tree that had fallen over. Possible to climb up the hill and go around the roots but couldn’t negotiate it without getting quite muddy. Disappointed, we decided to head back along with several other groups of hikers who decided it wasn’t worth the slippery climb. The trunk of the the tree had one saw mark all the way through it so there must be some plan to eventually remove it. This was August 7th."
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,This hike is NOT in Kilauea,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've not been on this hike, so my 1 start review is a bit unfair. The one star is for all the reviewers who left reviews for a hike which is NOT where Trip Advisor says it is. This hike is in Wailua, NOT in Kilauea."
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,Fantastic views & relatively easy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited this trail in late September 2019; weather was nice but had just rained. We did the whole trail and even continued for a few miles past the bridge.... don't pass the bridge; it gets pretty boring and significantly warmer if sunny. The trail was great and the views were amazing. Beware that once you get to the picnic table you have two options, either left or right. Right takes you to the actual trail and towards a small old bridge (end of trail). If you go left, you will have amazing views, but it can get dangerous especially when muddy... the end of this section seems like it continues into the actual trail but don't try it unless you have experience in muddy vertical climbing. Parking was scarce but not many people there. Enjoy!"
Kuilau Ridge Trail,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail has many slippery muddy places, hike with caution, need to wear bug sprays. But it is very beautiful and lush, it's like you are walking in the Jurassic Park, very worth the hike. Great view to the black wall/weeping wall. It's very cool to walk on the ridge. "
Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,Lakeshore Trail - glimpses of sea caves,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family of five (myself, wife, and 3 kids ages 11 through 6) hiked the Lakeshore Trail. The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore website gives a good description of this hike and divides it in to three sections. We hiked the first two sections, which is about 4.8 miles round trip. I'm not sure if we hiked all the way to the Bowl, but we did hike for 15 minutes past the first section (the Crevasse). "

Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,Wonderful Hike thru woods to a terrific reward.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy to moderate hike back to The Crevace & The Bowl (sea caves). I am a healthy 71 and had no problems. not for anyone with foot, ankle or knee problems tho. 1st .8 mi east boardwalk. Next 1.5 mi well groomed path up and down with some elevation changes. 2.2 miles to Crevace & only another 1/2 mile to the bowl.  Seems some turned back complaining it was just a woods hike. BIG mistake. Great woods walk, but this trail rewards you with MAJOR eye candy & cliff side viewing of the rocks, shoreline, etc. WELL worth the effort of a 2.4 mile hike in."
Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,Gorgeous,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unfortunately we didn't have time to kayak out to the sea caves on this trip.  The beach here is BEAUTIFUL.  We arrived around dinnertime one evening and had the beach entirely to ourselves for most of the time we were there.  It is a little off the beaten path if you're just passing through (as we were on our way to Duluth) but I highly recommend stopping here, even if it's just for a quick walk on the beach or for a picnic.  Our photos are lovely."
Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,"Try to kayak the Sea Caves, then you can skip the trail",4.0 of 5 bubbles,I give the beach a 5 and the trail a 3. 
Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,Hike to the sea caves,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked at Meyers Beach ($5) and hiked to the sea caves. The first part is in the woods so not too interesting, but trust me it’s worth it once you get out to the shoreline. Not too strenuous but it is about 4.5 miles out and back. It took a little over 2 hours with stopping to enjoy the views and take photos. Make sure to take water, snacks, and bug spray. Steep drop offs at the edge so watch your children and pets closely."
Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,So VERY worth the drive!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There aren't enough words to describe how breathtaking this area is....unbelievable!!! We went with Rustic Makwa Den and it was perfect. 6 people and 1 guide...almost completely by ourselves. John was our guide, super chill,  and he knew all the nooks and crannies, history of the area, geology, etc. We had a great group  and took some amazing photos. I would definitely do this again and would go with Rustic Makwa Den again because it seemed the other tours had way too many people. So if you like smaller more intimate groups, then this is the outfit for you! "
Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,A must go!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I would highly recommend going to see the sea caves! It reminded me of Lagos Portugal! We spent the day there skipping rocks and laying on Meyers beach. We took a kayak tour to see the caves which I would recommend because they took us to all the cool spots! There is a bathroom, a water spigot and a bunch of cool trails. Fun for a family day or couples!"
Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,Fantastic!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This beach was beautiful...not wide, but long and with fine sand. An amazing place to view a sunset! The hike to view the sea caves is an easy hike, with the first 0.8 miles along a board walk and the second mile along a well worn path. The caves are amazing and the sound of the waves hitting the hollows was like nothing I have ever heard! Well worth the time to get here and to take in the beauty!"
Meyers Beach Sea Caves,4.5,Fun Scenic Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A must if you are visit this area.  Hike was nice, overlooking the sea caves.  The path was relatively busy closer to the trail head but then thins out as you hike.  We hiked almost the entire trail which ends in a camping ground.  We recommend only hiking the shoreline.  After this, you vier away and the trail isn't as scenic...."
Devil's Backbone Nature Trail,4.5,watch for snakes,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were starting the trail and barely got up it when we saw a rattlesnake. It just hung out on the trail, so we went back down. This was after seeing 2 other venomous snakes (not on the trail) and we had kids so we just decided to abort. When going back down the trail, my husband stepped on a tiny baby snake (which was also venomous) so at that point we were definitely done with it. It's their home so we figured we'd let them be and move on, maybe one day we can hike it when it's not snake season."
Devil's Backbone Nature Trail,4.5,Wildflowers and Rock Formations,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Good for a short 2 mile loop or a longer hike along the backbone.  As you get further out, the trail becomes very rocky and steep, so be prepared.  It is very busy on the weekends so come early, also to beat the heat, as there is no shade.You need to pay the fee or have a park pass.  Pay it, quit complaining.  Someone has to clean the bathrooms and empty the trash."
Devil's Backbone Nature Trail,4.5,Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a Great place to Hike. Take water because there's hardly any Shade. So in the Summer time go early. A lot of Rattlesnakes in the summer. just be smart enough to use caution. If someone is visiting from out of town would be a great short Hike.
Devil's Backbone Nature Trail,4.5,Breathtaking views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy enough to navigate for slightly out of shape out of towners.  My 12 year old son loved it!  The views were amazing!  No shade to speak of, so wear sunblock. Make sure to bring some water too!"
Devil's Backbone Nature Trail,4.5,Good exercise,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Uphill to top and then downhill so prepare if it’s a hot day. Once to the “rest” point the trail is far from clear to the Keyhole which was my goal. Barbed wire fence where trail used to be? Other way is dead end. Went around the fence and rock climbed but never sure if I saw the keyhole...did it crumble?! 
Devil's Backbone Nature Trail,4.5,Great Place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We throughly enjoyed our visit to Devils Backbone. We took our 9 year old grand daughter. She enjoyed walking the trails and learning about the geography types of rocks that make up this formation. The trails were relatively easy to walk. The wildflowers were beautiful . The day we went it was cloudy, the temperature was comfortable. I would recommend that you bring water. They have water filling stations for you and your pup at the beginning of the trail."
Devil's Backbone Nature Trail,4.5,GREAT HIKE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice place close to Loveland, Colorado to take a hike.  Most of the way is easy to moderate.

Devil's Backbone Nature Trail,4.5,Good hiking spot for all ages,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is not among mountains and pine trees, but it is a great place to go for any type of hike you are seeking.

Four Mile Trail,4.5,Best Views in Yosemite Are On The Way Up!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike with the highlight of our family trip!  So beautiful and challenging, but our entire family including an athletic nine year old made it up in the average amount of time expected complete it without issue.  We had not originally planned to take this hike if the road had been open. But, wouldn't have wanted to miss this awe-inspiring journey.  Some of our best pictures from the entire trip came from this hike!  Just driving to the top would've missed the incredible journey!  We are so glad we chose to stretch our physical limits!  There is a rustic bathroom open at the summit even though the road is closed."
Four Mile Trail,4.5,Strenuous but rewarding views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a strenuous and rewarding hike!  This was my first hike while visiting Yosemite for the first time!! I love morning hikes as there is less traffic and you really get to enjoy the peaceful sounds of nature.  I arrived at 8am on Saturday morning and found plenty of parking along the road.  You will see the sign ‘four miles trail’ from the road.  Started the hike at 8:10am.  This is a steep steady incline of a hike with constant switchbacks all the way up.  This is also more closer to a 5 mile hike and that’s one way all the way up so coming down you would be doing close to 10 miles in total.  Halfway up I got a bit freaked out doing a solo hike as i thought I would see more hikers than I actually did.  I only saw 4 people while I was going up.  I also am afraid of heights with certain things so there were definitely some points  where I was as close to the rocks as I could be.  When I thought about going back, my body just turned around with determination and continued onward, so glad I did!! It was very rewarding when I reached the top.  The views are magnificent and you get a great view of half dome.  Be prepared to see quite a few people at the top as there are tour buses that drive people to the top of glacier point.  I stayed up here to have snacks and enjoy the views.  They have a filling station for water that was working thankfully.  "
Four Mile Trail,4.5,Rewarding Challenge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail could be a challenging monster at times, but it was very rewarding! The views change all the way up and Glacier Point is amazing. I was hoping to hike the Panorama, but with the shuttle not being in service this year, this was my second choice, and it did not disappoint. The way down was more challenging than expected, maybe due to the lack of grip on the bottom of my shoes. The fine granite sand on top of the old, paved trail made it a bit slippery in the steep spots. We arrived early, around 7:30-8 and had no trouble parking right at the trail head. I think our total time with hanging at Glacier Point for a bit was 6 hours. Take as many breaks as you need and enjoy the views."
Four Mile Trail,4.5,Impressive hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Along with my 14 year old son I did the walk up and Down again due to the closing of the Glacier point Road.

Yes, the valley views are breathtaking from Four-Mile Trail! However, we do not recommend hiking Four-Mile trail from the top, Glacier Point, to the base.

Four Mile Trail,4.5,Awesome hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The 4 mile trail (which is really more like 5 miles each way) was the highlight of our Yosemite trip. We stayed in the Half Dome Village and took the bus as close as we could get to the trailhead. The trail head is pretty easy to find. You begin the hike in the trees, then bust out of the forrest w/ an AMAZING view...then its switchbacks for days. Once you reach Glacier point, there is plenty of snacks and merchandise galore- but the best part is the amazing view! The snacks at the top (read: ice cream) were a great motivator for our kids to keep going. "

Four Mile Trail,4.5,Do it early in the am!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a beautiful trail! If you are walking from the shuttle stop no 7, it will take you 5.4 miles to the Glacier Point. Maintained very well; just a steady climb and absolutely beautiful. People with fear of heights can do this with no problem (wide shoulders and no steep drop offs). Took my husband and I 2.5 hrs to complete and we stopped plenty of times for pictures. We started early at 9 am and there was hardly anyone on it. Recommend."
Bryce Amphitheatre,5.0,Spectacular,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There's a $35 entrance fee unless you have a National Parks pass, then it's free. Breath taking for it's beauty as well as it's huge size. There is no place on earth like it.  Pictures somehow just do not do it justice."
Bryce Amphitheatre,5.0,Amazing!  This Is Bryce Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Bryce Amphitheater is the bowl that is filled with hoodoos. It stretches out and descends from the rim.  Technically Bryce is not a Canyon because it doesn't have walls on both sides.  The amphitheater was formed by water flowing off the rim and down into the bowl and onward from there.  The Amphitheater is the main attraction at Bryce Canyon and it can be viewed from several point including Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset Point, and Sunrise Point.  "
Bryce Amphitheatre,5.0,Put it on your to do list,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely stunning. We hiked the sunrise to sunset trail going down the less steep slope coming back up the shorter steeper route.

Bryce Amphitheatre,5.0,"Words and Pictures Can't Capture It, You Have to See It Yourself",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Amphitheater is what you come to Bryce to see, one of the 5 natural wonders of Utah.  It is incredible, but unfortunately in March, it can be covered in ice and snow which prevents you from hiking without the right equipment.  For Floridians, this seemed too much so we passed on hiking.  I will say even in the snow and ice, there are plenty of places you can go to see the wonders of the amphitheater.  It is truly amazing and words and even pictures can't capture it.  You have to see it."

There is shuttle to run though those attraction points in summer, you can also drive to those points as well. You can also hike some trails in this area. If you don't hike, half day may be enough for you to see the attractions point, but if you hike, each hike at least 1.5-2 hrs, some hike may be even longer."
Bryce Amphitheatre,5.0,Must See,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"At Bryce point, go to the concrete path viewpoint, then go to the off-path bare ground point. Go ALL the way along the path up to where the rock outcropping looms over the amphitheatre. Now look around. See the Cathedral? Look to your right. See the people on the concrete overlook you just visited? Drive to and stop at every viewpoint on the drive, then hike as you can. Take the 3-hour horseback (or mule) ride down to the valley floor. Bryce is awesome."
Bryce Amphitheatre,5.0,Underrated National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bryce Canyon is beautiful!  The Amphitheatre is so amazing.  This is a must see.  Take the extra time to stop at all the sites at the park, it is well worth it.  Take the time to look around as you are driving from stop to stop, all of Bryce Canyon is amazing."
Bryce Amphitheatre,5.0,Out of this world,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bryce Canyon is not really a two-sided canyon but rather the one-sided eroded edge of a plateau, filled with erosional features called Hoodoos. In Bryce the platform rim curves around somehwat, hence the name Amphitheatre. "
Bryce Amphitheatre,5.0,A must see when visiting Bryce Canyon!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Amphitheater shuttle: This is free and should arrive at stops along the amphitheater every 10-15 minutes. You can hop on and off of this shuttle, no reservations needed.  We drove to a few different spots early evening, it wasn’t very congested and easily found parking. Since we only had the afternoon here, we unfortunately only did a few short hikes. I would definitely like to do more hiking next time we visit."
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,Not really an attraction,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"With the Colorado Belle closed near halfway point and the walk in front blocked the walk does not connect all of the on river properties. June, of course, is a very warm month. It would be nice to see some shade features and more benches along the walk. Due to Covid, the water  taxis were not offering all day passes just single trip passes"
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,Close your mouth,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I Love the river walk, but the bugs have taken over they fly all over you, stick to you, if your not careful you could swallow one. I don’t know where they have come from,it use to be a few, now they are everywhere. It is so bad you cannot enjoy it, maybe they can spray bug spray to try to get rid of the problem. Other wise it is a fantastic place. But I didn’t want to continue walking out there because of them. It is so sad."
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,A great walking trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Spent the night in the Camper parked in the Golden Nugget Casino parking structure. Rising early, and in need of a bit of exercise to work off Bubba Gump Shrimp Company excellent supper, headed over to the Riverwalk Trail at 0530. Wanted to try to bet the summer heat. Failed, it was already 90+ degrees. This easy paved trail stretches from the Laughlin River Lodge to Don Laughlin’s Riverside Resort. Trail is located near Hotel Corridor on Casino Drive. This walking trail gives you the opportunity to see the sights of Laughlin and activities on the Colorado River. As you travel on this trail, one can observe a multitude of boats, birds, and jet skiers on the River. Despite the early hour and heat, many individuals were strolling along the trail. The Colorado River was extremely busy. Need a break? Just exit the trail and duck into any of the 9 Casinos along the Trail. Certainly, a unique trail, which can be completed in 1½ hours or less baring interruptions. This is a novel idea for placing the Colorado River on display. Trail is open 24 hours / 7 days a week and is light up at night. Word of caution for nighttime walkers. Racoons, skunks, and other critters are often seen on the trail. River bugs (gnats, mosquitoes, and pesty flies) will drive you crazy. For daytime hikers, be sure to dress appropriately, it can get exceptionally hot on this trail due to the lack of shade. A hat, sunglasses, suntan lotion and water are a must have items for summer travel on the Riverwalk Trail, Your health and safety are important. Use common sense and have fun."
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,Early Morning walks - Easy access to casinos,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Staying at Riverside casino.  Like getting up early in morning for walks with coffee.  Stopping along the way at various casinos.  Also enjoy late at night.  Watching some wildlife (raccoons, ducks and sometimes skunk).  During spring and summer, bands and vendors setup.  Like to stop and look."
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,Always a Peaceful & Contemplative Stroll !!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Each time I come to Laughlin, I make it a habit to get out early and walk along the Riverwalk.  I've walked it during midday and in the evenings, but I prefer the serenity of the dawn. It's a perfect time to reflect on the wonders of Life!"
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,shock,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Enjoyable but lodging at Harrahs was really a bummer…outdated and dirty even hallway had cobwebs out side our door and in the hallways. The drapes would not close properly and the carpet was dirty. They need to revamp the tower and redecorate along with hiring people to just clean as one would do in their home but that seems to be out of the realm of reality toward everyday life. I was certainly shocked at the audacity of such a company, and that, they would place people in such surroundings; especially with the pandemic at the stage it is at this time!    The Riverwalk is a great addition for travelers to catch some sun and a little exercise also. That was enjoyable to experience!"
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,Inconsistent,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"During a recent stay at Harrahs in Laughlin I used the Riverwalk. In places it's very pretty and functional and others basically non-existent. It was nice getting off of the street. At one point there was no way to go except through a property. At another, workmen closed the walk right in front of me for no apparent reason. If they could complete this from Riverside to Harrahs, it would make for a much nicer experience."
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,Nice leisurely walk along waterfront.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,You can get on the riverwalk from most hotels along the waterfront.  Easy walk from Edgewater to base near Harrah's and official walk ends there although for the adventurous it is a dirt climb from there up to Harrah's which can be tiring in the heat.  MInd the small ditches caused by rain if you do decide to climb the hill to Harrah's
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,Free and easy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I knew the title of this one would get attention! Hahaha. This walkway is outside most of the casinos. I think it is only not outside of Harrahs. As Harrahs is on an island unto itself. We parked at the Aquarius and after a time there we exited out the back to the Riverwalk and went in n out for a day of gambling, eating, drinking at all the different casinos. Then did it some more on Sunday."
Riverwalk Trail,4.0,The Lauglin Riverwalk Is A Nice Outdoor Experience,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well I wouldn't come here just to walk along the river. But as long as you're going to visit anyway, this is a paved outdoor pathway connecting several of the major hotels at the northern end of the  Laughlin Strip. it makes for a pleasant respite from being inside among the gambling machines and other hubbub. From here you can watch the jet skiing, or rent one and try it for yourself. And there are other kiosks along the way where you can book other vacation options. Some people like to do their afternoon happy hour out here on the lawn. The actual town path begins up by the bridge at the large public parking area. Walk over to Arizona if you like. It will only take a few minutes."
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,"Oh my heavens, this trail! Please read for warnings and tips!!",3.0 of 5 bubbles,Where to begin...
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,Nice place to Relax,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We have visited Niagara Falls several times over the years and it seems to change slightly by season.  This was our first visit to Devil's Hole State Park.  It was clean and they had ample parking for the guests.  There is little difference in the views from Whirlpool State Park.  This seems to be a great starting point for those fishing the bottom of the powerplant as we saw many taking their poles and nets down the trail.  Good place to spend an hour.
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,Lots of stairs but you won't regret it.. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I'm a nature lover and this place is beautiful with an  amazing view of the lake. We went like at 6:30pm and there was hardly anyone there. We started going down the stairs ( and they were endless and a bit steep) it took us 20m min give or take to get to the cave. On our way back we conted over 400 stairs. There is parking and everything is well maintained. Watch your step and enjoy the view. 
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,Devil's Hole hike -- must do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The loop from Devil's Hole State Park to Whirlpool State Park is a great hike!  It does involve a lot of stair steps and some rocky uneven ground.  So, wear good hiking shoes/boots.  But the views are nice.  There's also a cool cave and a giant rock ... lots to see!"
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,Stairs and steep walk down,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Spent about 1 hour here in May after seeing that Whirlpool State Park didn't have alot to offer.
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,DHSP,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"A pull off with limited parking, this state park seems to have a canyon side trail and an overlook but is lacking is size. The primary overlook mostly shows concrete structures, the overlook at Whirpool State Park upstream was much more interesting to me. This location is easy to find and convenient to check out. Free to enter, stay longer if you want or move on with no loss. "
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,Ruined by vandels,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The cave at the bottom of a well-worn trail was absolutely trashed with graffiti and broken bottles.  A sad commentary on the lack of respect that the youth from the nearby town had for not only a natural jewel, but also a once sacred holy place for the Seneca Indians"
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,Don't miss it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,If you came to see the Falls you must go and see the other parks along the Gorge.  Devil's Hole is very scenic and allows you to go down below the cliff into the gorge and walk by the river.
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,"You are close, just do it",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So you are at the falls and on tripadvisor looking for other things to do... how about you drive/bike the few minutes away and visit this place. You won't die from taking time from your precious life to view another angle of the great river that divides two countries. As a geologist it's spectacular, as a human it's humbling. From this view point you can see the amount of water flowing  that recently went over the falls and the human engineering that allows us to heat and power our homes using WATER. Whatever, you environmentalists, we utilized the dramatic geology here for human empowerment and this location will put things in perspective. "
Devil's Hole State Park,4.5,Trail is Great but NEED Better Signs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started the trail at Whirlpool state park and hiked to Devils Hole, there are some spray painted signs to the parking lot but we were a little confused about where exactly the ""hole"" was.. lol! We hiked back the rim trail and it was gorgeous! For beautiful state parks the signs could be a bit better on the trail along the gorge! The maps and signs up top seem all perfect til you go down to the trail then question things!"
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,"Nice views, easy trail.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice walk along the bluffs. The trail is level and paved, so it's an easy walk. The ocean views and the sea-stacks are inspiring, especially around sunset. I was disappointed by the absence of vegetation - the land is virtually barren."
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,Can't beat the beauty of this trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It seems to go on forever - clean, well-maintained, and fun for all ages as it is easy to walk on. Benches and restrooms along the way make it very convenient. Take a picnic and enjoy the sunset! Gorgeous."
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,Thanksgiving in Ft. Bragg,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Ft. Bragg is a wonderful community. This was our second trip there and I couldn't think of a better spot to spend Thanksgiving. We took our parakeet for a Thanksgiving morning bike ride along the coast trail. Beautiful. 
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,The Coastal Trail was excellent,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked the trail on a day where there were hardly any people, so that was a huge bonus.  We walked from our hotel to downtown along the trail then wanted to go downtown, but could not find the path to get there.  The land between the trail and downtown was fenced off, we were never able to find the connecting trail to downtown so we could have lunch."
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,Go beyond the glass beach,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fabulous views and great tracks. Even in a foggy morning it is so beautiful with the ocean, massive rocks, coves and trees. Very much worth a detour."
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,Lovely walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We stayed in Fort Bragg on the way from Seattle to San Francisco and although the town is a little run down due to the demise of the logging industry they investment in the Coastal Trail is excellent and is well worth a visit. Most visitors will be drawn by glass beach but it is worthwhile exploring Mackerricher State Park which is north of the town.
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,Take a Walk in Fort Bragg,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful views of the ocean, the cliffs, and some great spots to look back at the village of Fort Bragg.  The Trail is easy to access, kid, bike, stroller, and wheelchair easy... Dog friendly, keep the furry kids on leash and bring your camera... Park at Glass Beach and hit the trail...Northern California coast is rugged and beautiful.  Stop in town first and grab a coffee and muffin to go and have breakfast on the cliffs... the walk is super easy and not too long. Certain times of the year you'll see wales.  If you're feeling more rugged, head North off the paved trail and walk all the way to McKerricher state park... Clean bathrooms await you at the Glass Beach parking lot... Enjoy!"
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,Just gets better and better!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The City of Fort Bragg has been busy reclaiming the industrial wasteland left by Georgia Pacific and building a great bluff-top trail. Before long it will stretch from Todd's Point to Ten Mile Beach. Already it's given back access long denied to locals along a spectacular bit of Northern California Coastline. 
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,Great Trail for Run-Walk-Bike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Fort Bragg Coastal Trail is a gem of a pathway that runs from Glass Beach at the foot of Elm Street to MacKerricher State Park. The trail is paved and provides a scenic and safe place to walk, run or bike away from the busy traffic on Highway 1. Just be aware that there are spots where the pavement has buckled, resulting in tripping hazards to any inattentive travelers."
Fort Bragg Coastal Trail,4.5,"Great Place to Walk and Enjoy the Ocean, Photographer's Delight",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I disagree with the reviewer who called this trail bland.  There is a paved trail but also many walking paths where you can go for miles and miles.  The entrance is the same parking lot that you would use to visit glass beach.  Each of the adjacent coves are different.  In the winter, the trails are less visited and you can have the coves all to yourself.  The possibility of dramatic weather makes the ocean an ever changing scene.  Bring your camera."
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,Great Trail for Everyone!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The TART Trail is excellent!  It's well maintained, paved, and has an abundance of beautiful scenery.  I'm not normally a bicycle ride or walk through nature type of person, but I really enjoyed these trails.  My wife is a cyclist and she talked me into renting an eBike so we could ride together one day.  We rode 26 miles and I really enjoyed it. "
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,Great network of hike/bike trails in Traverse City,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The main track runs from downtown out to acme along the railroad track. For those staying at the motels along Munson Avenue, there are numerous access points to get on the trail. Same is true for those staying at the campgrounds on Munson Avenue. It’s very popular with cyclists and joggers..  I’ve used it numerous times."
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,Easy Access from Our Hotel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Comfort Inn where we stayed gave us perfect directions to ride our bikes several blocks, cross the street and access the TART trail at Hastings Street.  We rode about 12 miles along trails and wooden bridges.  It was very nicely maintained and was a highlight of our day.  Traverse City is a very bike friendly town."
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,The best way to explore Traverse City,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My number one recommendation to anyone who visits Traverse City is always ""Bring your bike!"" and take advantage of at least 1 of the many TART Trails while vacationing; visitors can even park their car & use the trails for transportation like many locals do. "
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,Great Day on the TART,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented two bicycles from The Brick Wheels  bike shop in Traverse City.   We then rode down Front Street to Hall Street where the bus transfer station is. We boarded the number 10 bus along with our bicycles and took the bus to Suttons Bay. We got off the bus at Suttons Bay and rode the 17 mile TART trail  back to Traverse City.   The bicycle ride back  along the trail Was beautiful. The trail is well-maintained and basically level, it is an easy 17 mile ride back. The trail passes through many beautiful wooded areas and farmland, as well as many wineries what you can stop and tour or attend a tasting.  This was the highlight of our visit to the area."
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,Great place to ride your bikes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love to ride on flat, paved bike paths with relatively no traffic - and the TART Leelanau Bike Path didn't disappoint!  We started in Traverse City mainly just wanting to go for a short ride.  We ended up going all the way to Suttons Bay (16 miles+/-).  The asphalt is in great shape, the signing is GREAT.  You do have to cross some roads with traffic so be aware because the cars do fly by.  It doesn't go by the bay but it does go through lots of farmland, orchards, etc.  You cross over a couple of streams, a couple of wooden overpasses, AND a couple of stops with a portajohn at one of them.  Also there are a couple of places with a big cooler of water to refill your water bottles.  This was a great ride - a little long for us by the time we made out way back to Traverse City.  Took us about 4-5 hours with a stop for lunch and sight-seeing in Suttons Bay.  Great job Michigan on such a great bike path!"
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,Beautiful  Bicycle Ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The TART trails offer a lovely ride passing by such places as Hull Park behind the public library, along Boardman Lake, thru the Traverse City downtown area, thru the historic district with beautiful houses dating back to the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Then you can continue along West Bay and out the Leelanau Trail thru ""wine country, and fruit orchards.   You can pedal the round trip to Suttons Bay ( 30 plus miles) or return from Suttons Bay on the local bus service (BATA) that provides space to transport bicycles.  Many places to eat, have a refreshing drink, or just enjoy the scenery. "
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,This was a great day on a fabulous trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I (not very experienced bikers) had an absolutely fabulous day on the TART trail!  We rented bikes from Brick Wheels (very helpful) and headed onto the trail, our goal was Sutton's Bay.  The trail was wonderful, as you leave Traverse City, it is well marked. Then you get to the part away from the traffic and it's even better. We rode through woods, fields, orchards, vineyards etc.., all very lovely. The sounds of nature and no cars/exhaust to contend with. Even the 6.5 miles that are currently unpaved were enjoyable. We had a picnic lunch at the beach in Sutton's Bay, did some swimming, and rode back into Traverse City. It was a throughly enjoyable day and after having ridden almost 40 miles we had a great sense of accomplishment too!  I would really recommend this to anyone visiting the area."
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,A great bike path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a wonderful bike path for a easy ride through the country. We did the 17 mile one way where the bus brings you  to Suttons Bay and you ride back to Traverse City . And we did another part of trail through Traverse City and up to Acme another day. You could do all in one day very easy and beautiful scenery.
Traverse Area Recreation and Transportation Trails,5.0,Love to Bike? Don't Miss the Leelanau TART Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This 17-mile (1-way) paved bikes/pedestrians-only trail from Traverse City (pick up the trail at Carter Street or pedal from anywhere in town) is awesome! Bike up to Sutton's Bay and reward yourself with a huge breakfast at the 45th Parallel Cafe immediately after the trail ends in a paved area right in town. Or, pack a lunch in your backpack and stop for a picnic along the way; there are numerous benches along the route. Incredibly scenic, with gentle inclines vs. the more aggressive hills you'll find biking public roads in Northern Michigan, and with many shady areas, you'll really enjoy this ride - we did! If you run out of steam after you get to Sutton's Bay, you can load your bike on a bus and get back to TC the traditional way."
The Rock Garden,5.0,Amazing Details,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This place is truly a hidden gem! The details on many of the miniatures are amazing. They are adding new structures all the time so there is always something new to see. A lovely place to spend an afternoon.
The Rock Garden,5.0,Cute Display,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Rock Garden was a fun little stop. There is nothing that jumps out at you when you arrive to let you know you have made it, but when you get to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, the drive on the left side of the building will take you to the display. The various miniature structures are very detailed, and it's obvious that someone has put a lot of time and effort into it. The area is located beside a stream, and there are places to stop and enjoy nature and meditate. There is no charge to enter but please do donate while you're there. "
The Rock Garden,5.0,Something Different for a Great family stop for picnic ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Stopped here on our way to Chattanooga.  Several picnic tables.  Cow pasture near by so on a windy day may get a fragrance of cow patty hear and there.  Garden is mostly shaded. Very calming with light music playing.  Kids loved looking in the buildings and finding the mini figures. It’s sad to see where people were too rough and damaged the art (this is sparse) There is no sign from the main road. You turn into the church parking lot and go around back. Then it’s obvious. Only bathrooms are portables. 
The Rock Garden,5.0,Everything is so life like,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been here a couple times and it’s always a work in progress but they add so much each time I visit. Everything is so life like there’s also some figurines. Please don’t touch those because they are fragile as is everything there. It’s a great place to take pictures and every time I am there, there are people doing so. "
The Rock Garden,5.0,Creative rock replicas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very creative. Small miniature replicas of landmarks and castles made from river stones and shells. Lots of pretty flowers  Along the paths are religious oriented messages spelled out in stones.  Fabulous way to spend an hour walking. You can even have a picnic at one of the tables provided.
The Rock Garden,5.0,Fascinating,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. Its so interesting, creative and fascinating. Someone has a lot of talent it was very busy when I wen and yet it wasnt crowded and everyone tried to  their best to let othes see all of it. They also have lots of flowers and landscape, someone was there the day we went cleaning up and making sure it was taken care of. Also its free but they do have a donation box which I saw several people dropping a little bit in the boxes. They also have picnic tables if you want to picnic. Also a couple paths if you want to walk a little."
The Rock Garden,5.0,Special Place to stop by for quick view or picnic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely Amazing. Peaceful, beautiful.  Great for all ages if you can walk on narrow, uneven paths.  The imagination and detail that went into creating these structures is incredible.  I am thankful I found this special spot and highly recommend stopping by.  It is only 5 miles off 75.   It is free.  We gave donation."
The Rock Garden,5.0,A must see!! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wow! Spectacular! This gem of a place is neat. My kids and husband and I went and we loved walking around and seeing the details of these builds. Neat story and places. We would highly recommend it. Any age kid would think it's fun! 
The Rock Garden,5.0,Enchanting Stroll,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A quiet place to allow your thoughts to wander.  Spend some time unwinding as you stroll through the enchanting rock displays of houses, castles, gardens, and paths. This place was started by a retired gentleman who enjoys creating places out of rocks and pebbles."
The Rock Garden,5.0,Unique and beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a beautiful stop on our way to Chattanooga, TN. It was our first trip to Chattanooga and we saw this lovely rock garden was going to be on our way and so we made the stop. We are so happy we did as we thought the garden was just gorgeous. Such intricately made castles, homes and other figures. It is free to visit, but it is a part of a church so donations are appreciated. If we find ourselves in that area again, we would stop to visit the Rock Garden.  "
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,"Beautiful Views, but very hot!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked the section of the Canyon Rim Trail from Shoshone Falls Park to the Evel Knievel Jump Site. Many of the views were stunning, but it was also very hot! Probably better to get an earlier start and carry lots of water. (I could easily have consumed 2 liters while walking.)"
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,A Must See If You're in the Area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Cross the Perrine Bridge on Highway 93 and pull off to the right at the visitor's center. You can walk for over a mile along one of the beautiful canyons in America. We didn't go all the way, but we are told you can walk all the way to the ramp where Evil Knievel tried his attempt to rocket across the Snake River Canyon in 1974. "
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,A great place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Growing up here I spent plenty of time exploring the canyon. Returning here after a 15 year absence the trail was a great surprise. It winds for miles along the canyon rim. Great views and lots of friendly people. You can watch the people jump off the bridge.  Great way to spend time on a walk 
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,"""Lovely Views, But Misleading Name""",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great views of a changing panorama as you walk the miles. Easy to get to from town. What it doesn't mention is that this is really a river canyon RIM trail, not at water's edge. You can see a beautiful hiking path from the rim, that follows the river bank, but it's not easy to access. The only way down (other than dropping by parachute) is to get a kayak and paddle to the trail from a park at the end, which you need to drive down the mountain to do that. But then you've got a kayak to deal with, unless you opt to paddle your kayak for a few miles down river."
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,What a view!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the highlights of Twin Falls!!!  Not only is the view amazing, but the trail follows the length of the southern side of the canyon. The trail is really well kept and allows for strollers, rollerblading, running, or a nice evening stroll.  There are several spots to access the trail, but the most popular is right off of Perrine bridge.  Either parking in the parking lot of the visitor's center, or on the opposite side of the road in front of Best Buy, etc.  On a good day you can watch BASE jumpers flying off the Perrine bridge, as well as catching a view of the waterfalls from the middle of the bridge looking East.  If you go to the "
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,Incredible views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I work right next to the trail so I walk it most days on my lunch. It is very well maintained for the most part and pretty well traveled during daylight hours. At least in good weather. 
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,Great views ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked from the falls to the Evil Knievel site. It is a paved trail and has some hills to climb. My granddaughters enjoyed the hike. It has some great views.
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,"The location to drive in is a bit hidden, but we were persistant.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For years, we drove over Perrine Bridge, admired the scenery and went on.  This time we drove down to the river and found hidden falls throughout the drive that could not be seen from the road.  We were so happy to discover this area. If you golf, this is the access to the golf course."
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,Strollin' with some views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Snake River Canyon Trail is a wonderful paved walking path that meanders along the Snake River Canyon. You could end up going on quite a long walk if you have the time. There are various points you may park and walk depending on your destination. The Visitor Center or the corner of Pole Line and Eastland give you access to the high points of the trail. I commonly park at the Pole Line and Eastland lot and head to the east walking past the dirt mound that formerly held the jump for Evel Kneviel. As you continue past that point the trail will begin to wind through the high desert terrain and descend into Shoshone Falls Park offering some of the most spectacular views of the falls. It does get steep as you approach the Shoshone Falls Park so if you go down the trail, remember you have to come back up. This trail offers a very close look at the canyon and many parts can be dangerous for small children and animals. I also do not recommend riding a bike down to Shoshone Falls unless you are a skilled rider due to the grade. There is also a lot of pedestrian traffic and many people are still learning trail etiquette so be patient. I frequent this trail weekly and if you can find the connector to the west end you can stop for dinner at some nice restaurants."
Snake River Canyon Trail,4.5,Snake River Gorge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Perrine Bridge and Snake River Trail provide excellent views of the Snake River Gorge.  We walked the trail for a 1/2 mile or so both upstream and downstream of the bridge.  You could see beautiful parks and homes south of the bridge.  We got a real WOW moment as we were getting ready to walk under the bridge heading back to the parking area on the ridge.  A base jumper had walked out on the bridge, climbed over the rail, through out his sail and jumped.  What a thrill to watch 12 second of flight to a landing spot on the shore line.  The Perrine Bridge is the only place in North America were you can base jump without a permit.  The Info Center/Museum has some excellent docents to tell you about the history of the local area.  We also got directions to Shoshone Falls (a must see) and Twin Falls."
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Fun Walking Trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Murphy River Walk is located right off of downtown Murphy. The trails are paved or nicely maintained gravel. One thing to watch for is the flooding that occurs when there is a heavy rain. The river level will rise over the trails. This is a fun place for all to participate.
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Peaceful easy feeling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful river walk with many different trails. Some paved, some gravel, and some boardwalk decking. It seemed to be well maintained and we walked at least 2 miles each day and never really walked in the same area twice.  Good Job Murphy on this little gem."
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Nature lakes steams to fly fish and hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,It was a warm day August 2020. The drop box didn’t have the yr   Walked and drove the river and park in the small quiet town of Murphy. Rented a cabin in a stream and had a great time at the Parsons Pub an Irish atmosphere lending to The Murphy roots
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Nice easy walking trail.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed a pleasant and easy walk on this mostly level trail.  There are several trail head parking areas with close access.  Lots of folks out walking their dogs, and a few groups with children.  River views are very nice."
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Nice setting.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I checked out this park last year during my visit to Murphy, NC. Great area for taking a leisurely walk and to take photos. There had been heavy rains the day before so some areas on the walkway were under water but I could walk through most of the park. This park is in/near downtown Murphy. My GPS led me way out into the country, so be careful to get the correct route. I recommend a visit!"
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Scenic walk around the Hiawasee and Valley rivers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very interesting and calm walk with dog; feels like you are in the wilderness but you are right on the edge of the lovely town of Murphy, NC; loved the Indian legend of the Leech."
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Nice walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice walk along the river. You can scan QR code and listen to the guided tour on your phone. Easy parking. We enjoyed it. 
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Broke my arm here,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very dangerous place to run and walk. I broke my arm in two places after tripping over a “cleared” tree that had been covered by mulch. In some spots, there are tree trunks painted orange. I don’t understand why all trunks were not REMOVED before the mulch was placed. I have spent the past few days in a lot of pain due to the hazards on this trail."
Murphy River Walk,4.5,Nice Walking Trail,3.0 of 5 bubbles,The river walk trail can be accessed from Konehete Park which is just past the Valley River Bridge on Valley River Avenue going east from downtown Murphy.  The trail is well maintained and follows Valley River down to the confluence of the Hiwassee River and Valley River.  The trail is about a mile long and has a series of boardwalks for crossing wet areas and getting around the bluff near Tennessee Street.  A nice footbridge crosses the Valley River and offers great place for bird watching and watching ducks on the River.  There is no parking fee and no admission fee.
Murphy River Walk,4.5,You Need Directions!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Neither Trip Advisor's address or Google Maps will get you to the River Walk....we tried!  Go downtown Murphy and out Valley River Rd/Dr.  It is about half a mile past the Murphy Chop House on left.  Look for the park!  It was a nice long walk on a beautiful sunny day!  Paths are paved, gravel and board walk so wear your walking shoes!"
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Beautiful but hard,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Like all the  hikes in Big Bear, it is very beautiful.  This one is steep and the trail is not well marked so it is easy to get off the trail.  Then at the top you need to scale some boulders.   This is for more experienced, adventurous, hikers."
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Scenic but Steep Climb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Scenic views of Big Bear Lake and the pine forest.  The trail is well marked with cairns.  There is a great look out of Big Bear Lake just before the final climb to Castle Rock.
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Great trail with elevation! Easy to hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy trail to hike, even with our 2-year old dog. We hiked at 1pm and found lots of shade throughout the trail.  Trail is well maintained and easy to navigate. Note: As soon as you get close to the trailhead, find parking as quick as you can because it’s difficult to turn around and circle back"
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,"Great hike, Great views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Amazing hike.. parking was a little rough along the main road and you do need a pass to park/hike (only $5 at a 7-11 in town). We started the hike from bottom up and it is a out and back hike. Amazing views up to Castlerock, after that it's just a trail through the forest to the end. Still worth doing. Well paved with stepping stones for steps and markers along the path to guide your way. Pretty awesome views and area with boulder rocks to chill at and take pics.  Quick elevation gain to start, but if you're in decent shape, it's not bad. Will do this hike again when in area... totally worth it."
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Great hike.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This place does not offer parking so you have to park down the street. But the hike is steep and it is a good 3 miles round trip.  There are no restrooms so you need to go before your hike. Take water with you and the right kind of hiking gear. Beautiful views of the lake.  I will do it again next time I am up.
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Address listed is wrong - Great hike with fantastic views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The address on this listing is definitely wrong.  I have attached accurate details from the Big Bear website below.  The sign is very hard to see if you are driving, as it runs parallel to the road.  If you travel east from the dam on Hwy 18, the trailhead will be on the right and the parking turnout is just past it on the left.  if you get to Boulder Bay Park, you went too far.  "
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Beautiful views of the lake!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s a great short hike up to Castle Rock! It’s pretty steep at first and then because of the elevation, it’s a good workout! However, if you plan on going further up to the preserve and then lodgepole, there are way too many trails not marked! Not pleasant as we got lost for awhile."
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Great short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For the trail only being 2 miles round trip, it packs a punch. Mostly uphill but a fantastic workout. Gorgeous views and great places to take photos. Overall worth the trek but get the adventure pass for parking to avoid a ticket "
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Lots of climbing up but pleasant and lots of rocks to sit on and shade to rest in,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not for totally out of shape hikers. OK for the so-so fit.  It's uphill for a good 20 minutes or half hour. But it is pleasant with lots of interesting and huge rock formations. There are rocks to sit on to rest and lots of shade. Not good for little kids because the trailhead had parking across a busy, tight road with little room to walk on either side. Beautiful view. The trail is not well marked so don't say to your teen, ""I'll see you at the top."" You never know where they'll end up. If you are so-so fit or  above, and you watch the kids, then this trail is highly recommended."
Castle Rock Trail,4.5,Easy walk for beautiful pics,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I not being active hikers, decided on the Castle Rock Trail and were not disappointed. As the below reviews state, first mile is steep but well worth the view once you get to the top. Recommend for families and everyone!"
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,Beautiful area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Love just wandering around the lava cliffs and visiting the blowhole. On a calm sunny day we walk through the pools.  Blowhole is impressive when the wind and waves are coming from the north or west. Can be VERY windy and wet, and definitely bring water and good shoes. Don’t expect cell service so always think about the safety of the trail.  Road there is very winding and several parks along the way, so drive carefully.  Respect the local memorials and don’t trespass."
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,A must do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The coast line is very beautiful, it was very cool to walk on the volcanic rocks. it's worth the time and effort to take the trail. Go early as the trail will get hot. We went in near noon, it was very hot and no shad, the view was amazing, but I was miserable due to the strong sun light and hot temperature. This is a must do in Maui in my opinion."
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,Create your own adventure or go see the blowhole. Bring sunscreen. No shade. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Everything we read said to park at mile 38 (acid wash) instead of 38.5 (main) to get to the blow hole. We tried it—didn’t find the blowhole but made our own adventure down and  out on the volcano rocks. Unreal experience for my wife and me. Five stars.
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,Fantastic trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We stumbled on this trail looking for the blowhole since we stopped at the first parking area and was so glad we did. There are actually two blowholes. Climbing over the lava was fun but some might find it difficult. We are fairly athletic. 
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,Unique landscape,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was interesting for sure. The ""trail"" is not well-marked. I'm not sure it is marked at all. We use a pretty cool navigational app where users can upload hiking paths that may be hard to find otherwise and that helped us a great deal. If you feel confident navigating outdoors somewhat on your own, then you should definitely explore the area. The day we went it was super windy. I'm not sure if it is always that way, but just be prepared if so."
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,Difficult place to hike unless your in shape and have the proper footwear,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I love the desolate terrain here. I am a master hiker and outdoorsman and always wear the proper hiking footwear and attire, so I am comfortable on any trail as well as making my own trail. This is a place where you will need to blaze your own trail. leave your flip flops and casual shoes at home. Gear up with the proper attire and prepare to have yourself a blast here!"
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,Unique Hike Through Acid War Zone to the Nakalele Blowhole,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are in the west Maui area and would like a beautiful drive and really interesting hike into a blowhole, then this is for you.  The hike is around 30 minutes each way.  Wear very sturdy walking shoes because the terrain is rough in spots.  To get there, take highway 30 and drive north.  Right at mile marker 38 is a parking lot and after you park walk towards the ocean.  There is an old vehicle road to follow for part of the way and you will soon notice a lighthouse on the cliffs.  There are a couple of paths that you could take, but you eventually end up at the sea cliffs near the lighthouse. Go to the right of the beacon.  We used it as a marker to get back to our car.  Keep going along the rocks above the sea shore and you will see a very interesting landscape, which looks like a war zone.  The sea spray has made some very interesting formations in the rocks.  Keep going to the right and through the war zone and you will come to the Nakalele Blowhole.  We stood above and quite a ways away because the spray from the hole had a very high and powerful spray.  It could be dangerous to stand too close.  It was spraying often when we were there.  We made our way back on the same path that we came."
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,Acid War Zone Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hiking the Acid War Zone Trail was something I really enjoyed doing while we visited Maui. I met multiple people on the trail who were confused about the trail and how to get to the Nakalele Blowhole so I will mention some of what we experienced.
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,A wild hike through an alien planet,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our family decided to seek the famed Nakalele Blowhole.  Most people drive to the north (and closer) access path, but the real beauty and excitement starts from the south parking access (just after mile marker 38).  Note: it is best to hike this with shoes (not flip flops),  also, there really aren't any paths here to follow, just hug as close to the cliffs as you brave and follow it around clockwise.  From here we hiked the dramatic and violent coastline.  We scurried over volcanic rocks and watched as the ocean brutally smashed into the cliffs below.  There were several deep tied pools below with volcano rock arches and tunnels where the ocean would rhythmically feed and drain the pools.  We then entered the ‘Acid War Zone’ which is an area of eroding volcanic rock, it looked like a scene from an alien world.  Wrapping around the tip toward the blowhole we encountered sheer cliffs and drop-offs where the ocean was just raging and smashing the cliffs with massive waves that would explode into a plume of ocean spray.  Most of the time we listen to the smart side of our brain that says, be safe, be smart…, but there was something luring about the beauty of the water that activates the dumb side of your brain ignoring logic and commonsense making you seriously considering jumping the fifty foot cliff to swim to our death below.  Just as the smart side of my brain finally convinced my dumb half to shut up, my son comes to me and says, “I feel like I just want to jump in, let’s jump in Dad!”  A few minutes later, my daughter says, “What would you do if I jumped in?”  Apparently, we all have dumb side of our brains!  Luckily, all of our smart brains won out.  We finally made it to the blowhole and it wasn’t blowing.  Apparently we were there at the wrong tide level.  That was ok, because the scenery along the way was far more exciting than any puff of water out of a hole.  We ascended up to the second road parking lot and simply walked the road back to our car."
Acid War Zone Trail,4.5,Maui Magic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I remember reading that there was difficult hike to get to the blowhole and heart shaped rock and that it was difficult to find...I don't agree with any of this. It is not a walk in the park, you do have to climb over rocks but the ground is sturdy and as long as you watch your step you should be fine. We went in the evening and there was some people there to follow but it wasn't packed or too difficult to find your way. The blowhole is incredible. Seeing that much power come from the ocean is kind of mind blowing for me. The heart shaped rock is cute, especially for 2 people that just got married on Maui. I am glad we didn't miss this while in Maui. I love the natural beauty of Maui and these are the type of amazing hidden beauty I just can't get enough of."
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,Worth the struggle!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Strenuous hike but well worth it! The views keep unfolding, better and better. We're both in our sixties, and hike a lot, but this surprised us. We left at 9 a.m. and returned at 4 p.m. Admittedly, that included bathroom breaks, photo-taking, chatting with others on the trail and a 30 minute lunch - but still!  Perhaps 80% of the trail is scrambling over rocks, and it's just as hard on the way down as on the way up!  Still we loved it!  "
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,"Very hard, great views ",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started this hike at around 6:30am in order to beat the hot July heat. We lucked out with cloudy skies during the climb and full sun came out once we made it to the top. The club is very hard. We are in our 40s and hike regularly. May not be an ideal hike for those not in good shape or avid hikers, however you can always go slow. It’s 2000 foot climb almost all up. Had we been in full Sun it would have been even tougher. We thought views were well worth it! And we never saw another person in the four hours in and out that it took us. Def bring tons of water, some Gatorade for electrolytes, and a snack. "
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,Fun and challenging but not overly difficult.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fun hike! Challenging but definitely doable if you are a regular hiker. Most of the incline is moderate with just a few steep sections. It’s in direct sun and it is all uphill for the first half, so definitely bring lots of water. Really amazing views at the top and along the way. We made it up and down in about 3 hours and I didn’t feel overly exhausted by the end. I would definitely do this one again."
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,Super challenging,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"So we were thinking of doing the West Fork trail and then decided to get overly ambitious on our last day in Sedona and changed plans at the last minute for Bear Mountain.  We had previously done 2 other 2000 ft climbs in the last week of our Arizona trip, so figured we would give this one a try.  Well, this was definitely the hardest one!  (We had done South Kaibab to skeleton point in the Grand Canyon and Spencer Trail in Lee’s Ferry in the past week).  This was honestly more of a rock climb than a hiking trail.  So not only were you going up 2000 ft, you were basically rock climbing it- though not a scary, technical climb.  Just an exhausting climb!  The views at the top were beautiful and expansive.  It was almost as hard coming down as going up.  It took us about 5 hours to complete including all our stops.  I feel good that I was able to do it, but would not do it again!  "
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,Challenging Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"By far the most challenging hike we did in Sedona.  Views from the top are amazing and well worth the struggle.  Many false peaks can leave you somewhat discouraged as you climb but don't worry...the payoff at the top is incredible!  There are white directional markers painted on rocks to help you stay on the correct trail...they helped us tremendously.  We plan to return to Sedona in February and will definitely climb this ""mountain"" again!"
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,Don't be overBEARing,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"BEAR this in mind. There are over 135  US Forest Service trails in Sedona , and the vast majority are built for the "" 12 oz. bottled water crowd"", meaning there are gobs and gobs of tourists. "
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,Worth it! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Definitely the hardest hike of our trip to Sedona. Make sure to take plenty of water and allow 6 hours to complete. Takes a toll on the knees but the views are amazing! 
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,One of the better hikes for those who regularly hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What everyone else said already, they are all pretty accurate.  Somewhat less congested than other popular hikes in Sedona, but you'll not find solitude here unless you are hiking super early or late.  "
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,Challenging trail to the top but easy to the mid point for rookies.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Even if you don't go all the way to the top, we didn't, the half way point for rookies is easy. See my photos. "
Bear Mountain Trail,5.0,Awesome Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Climbed this week, 3 if us, all 60+ years and a bit better than average shape. Less than 2 hours to go up to, steady climbing but fantastic views reward you every 10 minutes. "
La Luz Trail,4.5,Amazing View,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went up on the first tram of the day in fear of it being too hot to walk this trail, but it wasn't uncomfortable to walk around in. Be prepared for the air to become a bit thinner the higher up you go but it's not unbearable, just take it easy if you're not used to such conditions. The walk itself was lovely, having a combination of vast views and walking through the woods, there was plenty to see for everyone. Make sure to bring plenty of water for this walk, it'll be needed on the final stretch before you reach the top, trust me... But it is all worth it as the view over Albuquerque was breathtaking ( and that wasn't from the walk haha)."
La Luz Trail,4.5,Nice long trail to the top,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Be in good shape and altitude acclimated prior to going up the La Luz.  Great switchbacks and wonderful views of ABQ along the way and from the top (where there's a good restaurant).  Don't try the entire trail without good boots an, water and a snack or two.  It'll be slippery after snows and rain - and there are places to have long falls and in some places the trail is very narrow."
La Luz Trail,4.5,Moderate to difficult with stunning views at the top!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We have read that it's a popular hiking trail located on the west face of the Sandia Mountains near Abq .  It begins at the La Luz Trailhead and proceeds to either Sandia Crest or the Sandia Peak Tramway.  Curiosity prompts us to check it out even though we know that we may have some problems with the 8 mile strenous trail on our first attempt.  We are prepared to hike as far as we can and enjoy what we see and accomplish.  As we hike we are treated to ever-changing views of cliffs and trees and wildflowers and some are amazing with many are unfamiliar. It is great trail which is moderate at the beginning but gets challenging as it elevates and the elevation is gradual at 150 ft as we climb.  After 3 hours of climbing and almost three quarters of the way we decide to turn back.  It was beautiful indeed!
La Luz Trail,4.5,"Excellent hiking spot, but go with friends",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I had a great time hiking hear while attending college at CNM.  It was a really peaceful place to meditate and clear my head.  However be warned - I have heard of people being attacked while alone on the trail.  Hiking is always risky anyway, so definitely bring a buddy if you're going to go. "
La Luz Trail,4.5,"More strenuous than expected, but very rewarding",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'd heard so many different opinions about the difficulty of this trail.  I'm a 51-year-old guy in decent shape, not much of a hiker but physically very active, and I found it moderate-difficult.  After 4 hours of uphill hiking, THEN we hit the steep part.  BUT SO BEAUTIFUL!  Go early, bring plenty of water and snacks, and plan to take the tram back down.  "
La Luz Trail,4.5,Hiked The Entire La Luz Trail Up,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked to the top of the Sandia Mountain Range via the La Luz Trail on Wednesday June 13th with my wife and I.  Below I will leave a ""quick summary"" for people wanting very basic info and to move on, then I will write a ""detailed review"" outlining more specifics and tips/tricks/thoughts."
La Luz Trail,4.5,The less strenuous hike on La Luz,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had an awesome loop hike with amazing views on the upper part of La Luz. We took the tram to the top and then hiked from the tram along the crest on La Luz to Crest spur which took us up to the Crest house. There we ate lunch and then hiked to the Kiwanis stone cabin and from there back to the tram along Crest trail. It was a total of about 4 miles and we had spectacular views. The hardest part were the switch backs to the Crest house but the rest of the trail was fairly easy and in the shade. The temperature was 10’ cooler on the mountain which made it very comfortable hiking in the middle of the day. 
La Luz Trail,4.5,"Great Trail, But VERY Strenuous",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After reading most of the reviews on here, I assumed this trail could be tackled in 5 hours. My wife and I are fit, exercise regularly, and even do Crossfit. This trail, well, it's no joke. We're in our mid-30's, and it took us just under 6 hours."
La Luz Trail,4.5,Excellent hike. Less challenging than expected for this sea level dweller,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked the La Luz trail from the trail head to the Sandia Crest, across to the tram. I tool the tram down and then hiked from the tram back to the La Luz trail head. "
La Luz Trail,4.5,A hike of unexpected magnitude,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a hike for beginners. This is not a hike for international tourists who have just arrived in the USA the day before. This is not a hike for anyone who normally lives at sea level, who travels 26 hours to get to Albuquerque from Australia, and is adjusting to the altitude. This is not a hike for those mentally unprepared. "
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Best Hike in New River Gorge - MUST SEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Minutes from the Canyon Rim Visitor Center is the best hike in NRG National Park.  It is about a 3 mile trail with about 1/2 mile along the road.  It has amazing views of the Gorge as well as the bridge and the river.  It also has a great trail through a beautiful Hemlock forest and two bridges over Fern Creek.  There multiple places leave the trail for views of the gorge, but the highlight is Diamond view.  While the point is shape like a diamond, the views are also diamond quality.  We went first thing in the morning are were able to see some of the floating mist in the gorge.  In addition, in May, the Catawba Rhododendron is in bloom and it enhances the hike in the forest along the rim.  This rhododendron is fairly unique to this area with a pink flower.  Finally, the stone wall at the canyon rim that provides great view is also a create climbing spot for the eastern US.  You can access the cliffs from this trail by ladder as seen in the pictures.  Long Point has a fantastic view of the bridge but for all the reasons mentioned, this is the Best Hike in NRG National Park."
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Incredible views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Excellent! We are traveling with our 7 and 10 year olds, so we choose our hikes carefully. We asked for recommendations in the visitor center and this was the first one, and I'm so glad it was!"
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Should be on your Gorge itinerary,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I decided to hike this one to get some views of the nation's newest National Park and was not disappointed. While I did not go out to Grandview or Long View, I can't imagine you will find a much better viewpoint in this park. I parked at the Fern Creek lot in the early morning and had no issues finding a spot, but I can imagine this changes as the day progresses. The trail stretches about a mile in the woods before reaching the wall. You will come upon climber access which does have a variety of views. One of the views is a diamond shaped rock pointing at the gorge. This is not the Diamond Point view, oddly enough. Keep going and you will find signage for this observation point. This is the best overlook on the trail and offers some excellent vantage points. Contrary to what some people say, you can see some of the bridge from a couple spots on this hike, but never the whole bridge. You can easily go to the Visitor Center a mile up the road for easy viewpoints of the bridge. From Diamond Point, you can hike back the way you came for a slightly shorter hike, or make it a loop through the other parking area and down the road. I turned around and retraced my steps. For a park with few hikes, this should be one that makes it on to your itinerary."
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Great Way to Spend a Morning!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived at Fern Creek parking at 8:45am on Saturday of Labor Day weekend and found a couple of spaces left on the parking lot.  The Endless Wall Trail is fairly flat and can be accomplished by anyone capable of walking a couple of miles.  Trail was a little muddy in spots.  We walked past the initial sign to split down to rock climbing access and continued up towards Diamond Point Overlook.  We stopped at a couple of beautiful overlooks on the way, but Diamond Point was the best and we were the only people there for 10-15 minutes then it got busy.  We continued on the trail and then took a near vertical steel ladder down to climbing access on opposite end of trail and then hiked back towards the original sign we saw. It was a narrow trail passing several people rock climbing and rappelling.  The trail was hard to find at times but we did some awesome bouldering back to another steel ladder, which went straight up to the first sign we saw.  It was 3 miles in all and we spent 3 hours with plenty of time to explore the sites and relax enjoying great views.  Highly recommended by all six in our party (44, 44, 19, 18, 18, 16)."
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Great hike especially before or after rafting ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked this trail the day before we went rafting on the Lower New River. It was so cool to see rafts going down the river where we were going to be the next day. The hike wasn’t too long and the views were amazing. It was over 90 degrees the day we hiked it and it was so shaded that we weren’t too terribly hot. Highly recommend this trail! 
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Hiked the Endless Wall Trail to Diamond Overlook - loved it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Highly recommend hiking the 1 mile Endless Wall Trail to Diamond Overlook and then turning around and coming back. Otherwise, if you complete the Endless Wall Trail, you'll end at a different parking lot.  Multiple rocks along the trail that provide overlooks to the river and gorge. Beautiful!!  Easy hike."
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Great for Familiy Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose this hike to do with family and dogs ages 10-73 because it was listed as easy/moderate.  That rating is fairly accurate, since it is pretty short but some of the terrain can be tricky, including some higher boulders that were tough for the grandparents.  We started to Fern Creek trailhead and took that to the Diamond overlook and turned around.  The overlook had awesome views of the gorge and was well worth the trek.  Not too many other folks on the trail at 9AM on a weekday."
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Stunning views from Diamond Overlook,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this on a Monday morning in October after a few days of moderate rain from Hurricane Ian. The day we hiked was partly sunny but the trail was still pretty muddy and slick in spots, so trekking poles are not a bad idea. We parked in the Fern Creek parking area and did this as an out-and-back to Diamond Overlook and back. You can do a loop if you want but we wanted to avoid walking the road at the end."
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,Nice hike for families,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked in the Fern Creek trailhead parking lot and hiked to the Diamond Point lookout (there is signage) and back to the same parking lot, which is about 2 miles and took us ~1.5 hours.  Much of the trail is level and all of it is quite shaded, which made it nice despite light rain.  Portions of the trail were hilly and the footing was a little slippery, no problem for the able bodied but would have been challenging for people with limited mobility.  There were several trails branching off leading to the cliff edge which offered good views.  We were able to see some rafters in the river, didn't 't see any rock climbers while we were there.  "
Endless Wall Trail,5.0,All these people can’t be wrong - Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked Endless on a Sunday morning around 8:30 with my Boston Terrier.  It had rained considerably the day before and there was some puddles and muddy spots, butit wasn’t sloppy.   At times there are plenty of roots to step over, but nothing about the trail is that challenging.  Once you get up on the walk, their are numerous unsigned spur trails leading out to various overlooks.  Pretty much, the better the spur trail looks, the better the view (and Diamond Point has signage).  We started at the 2nd larger parking area, walked the whole trail, then walked ip the road back to the truck. A ranger acted like walking up the road would be suicidal, but we found it easy with mostly wide gravel shoulders.  I think the light would overall be better later in the day, although you get views up AND down the river, so there may never be “perfect” light."
Kincaid Park,4.5,Nice place to try and spot Moose!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I visited here 3 times over two visits to Anchorage in the hope I would see a Moose. Thankfully on my last visit walking the coastal trail I spotted one and took some photos. Despite there size Moose are very hard to spot so take your time and listen out for them too.
Kincaid Park,4.5,So pretty!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So many great, well kept trails. The park was absolutely beautiful with so much scenery to look at. It goes right up to the coast, and I had a great time hiking here and walking down on the beach. "
Kincaid Park,4.5,Great Park!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This park is massive!  There are so many areas to explore and walk/ride around.  Supposedly, there are sometimes moose but we didn't see any.  Tons of athletic facilities.  You really need to know where you are going or you can easily get lost."
Kincaid Park,4.5,"Outdoors person, limited time? Get yourself to Kincaid Park.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've just been smiling at the average and worse reviews. If you are a hiker, soccer player, frisbee golf player, or walker, this is a gem of a park in the summer. Sledding is not bad in the winter if we have snow, and this is a world-class x-c ski area in the winter. (Don't plan to walk the hiking trails in the winter, but you can still bike the single-track trails then.) "
Kincaid Park,4.5,How can you get there?,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Absolutely no public transport can get you there. What a waste! We would have loved to hike through the park but not having a car made it completely unattainable. Anchorage - have a bus that can drop hikers off so they can enjoy this wonderful green space.
Kincaid Park,4.5,Moose sightings immediately upon arrival!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent two weeks in Alaska.  We were hoping to see moose while there.  A little over a week into our trip we still hadn't seen any moose (other than one female moose way in the distance in Seward).  We were in Anchorage, and I had read that Kincaid Park is a good place to spot moose.  My husband and I went there one evening just to see moose.  We had just arrived at the park and hadn't even parked the car when we spotted a female moose feeding right along the side of the road.  I put the window down and took several pictures without having to leave my car!  We then parked the car and started to look for the start of a trail.  We hadn't walked far when my husband spotted a male moose feeding in the distance.  I again took several pictures.  Since we had had a long day, and had accomplished our goal, we went back to the car and returned to the hotel.  I'm sure we would have enjoyed spending more time at the park, but we had already spent the day watching the bears feeding on salmon at Brooks Falls, and we were leaving the next morning to continue on to Girdwood for a helicopter/dog sled tour, so we headed back to our hotel for the evening.  I'd include photos of the moose in this review, but the files are too large to upload to Tripadvisor."
Kincaid Park,4.5,"Awesome park, just dont die in the quicksand",4.0 of 5 bubbles,After we hiked around the beach at Kincaid park my boss was telling me people sometimes get sucked in to the quicksand here. Fortunately that didnt happen to me though so it was thoroughly enjoyable. 
Kincaid Park,4.5,Saw our first moose!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"4 hours after landing from flight from PA, we went out moose ""hunting"". We've vacationed in New Hampshire 3x's and Maine 3's. Both states have watch out for moose signs. We NEVER saw a single moose (unless you count the backside of one as our headlights caught it zipping into the trees after crossing the road). In Alaska....we saw one just as we were entering Kincaid Park. It was grazing and didn't even mind the 200 pictures we took of it -- haha!!"
Kincaid Park,4.5,Huge park with lots to do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We come to this park every time we are in Anchorage. Lots of trails for walking/hiking/biking. Once we even saw what appeared to be cross country skiing practice going on. There is also a disc golf course here. We like to watch the planes take off and land from the airport. There are a couple of other roads off the main road that go to another lake.
Kincaid Park,4.5,Outdoor at its finest,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lovely trails, views, good ski trails, good for biking, walking running"
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,New Years Eve on the Riverfront,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went to the News Year's Eve Family Fireworks Show on the Wilmington riverfront this year.  We really enjoy it.  They had ice skating sessions on the riverfront rink starting at 6pm.  They advertised an ice sculpting competition from 6-8pm by the ice rink, but we were not able to find it.  The fireworks show were scheduled at 9pm. You could hear the music from the ice rink area from the riverwalk.  Basically you watch the fireworks from the riverwalk area.  You can bring your own folding chairs or blankets to sit on.  IF you are lucky you will get a bench seat along the walk.  OR there is always the option to stand to watch the fireworks show.  We have always chosen to stand.  Show lasts about 15 minutes so its not bad.  "
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,Wilmington’s hidden gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you haven’t visited or if it’s been a while since you have, you should check her out. I live here and I’ve always loved it but, she continues to evolve and improve. The new restaurants, hotels and activities are impressive. As I’ve stated in an earlier review, I’m shocked that she remains undiscovered considering what she offers. "
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,Greg & Kat’s Wilmington Riverwalk Experience.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Riverfront Wilmington is a gorgeous 1.75 mile long riverside walk attraction in Wilmington, Delaware and one in which runs parallel to Christina River."
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,Environmentally friendly!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was winter and cold but on those few sunny days when we could get outside, the Riverwalk was the ideal place to go. A good deal of reclamation is happening and it is becoming “bird friendly “. The decking makes it easy for prams and walking canes."
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,River Rocks,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This area is a treasure w/ miles of easy walking along the Christina River w/ plenty of nature to enjoy.  Hotels, restaurants, & other cultural experiences are readily available. Several large hotels make it easy to stay along the river & the Amtrak station allows for easy travel from distant parts."
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,Nice open air space in town,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Wilmington River Walk is a revitalization of the downtown riverfront of Christina River.  If you live in the area and/or visiting for a few days, it is worth exploring the path for jogging, biking, or strolling.  Other than that, there is not much to do.  Good place to walk while at the train station and waiting for trains or enjoy open air space after eating at nearby Market Street."
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,Willmington Riverwalk is lovely and relaxing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,During the pandemic we have been looking for things to do that seem low risk.  The Riverwalk is a wonderful place to spend time.  The river is lovely to see with the occasional small boat going by along with plenty of birds and small animals and a wide variety of trees and plants.  We usually walk for about half an hour and then stop by one of the restaurants along the walk that feature outdoor eating for lunch.  There is an urban nature preserve at one end of the walk with a 1/4 mile wooden walkway through marshes.  There is even a very small visitor center there with a tank with local fish and wildlife pictures and displays along with a rest room. It's pleasant and relaxing and just what we need during this difficult time.
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,Pleasant surprise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I really enjoyed this walk. From one end you get great views of the Wilmington skyline. You get good views of the river and plant life on the other side. The area is very commercialized, with restaurants, a children's museum, golf course, and a farmers market. Because it was a Tuesday in March not much was open. Parking lots are available around the area so check out a map first. My only complaint is the public bathrooms were closed. Thankfully the market had some."
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,The Best part of Wilmington,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been coming to Wilmington regularly for the past year. One of the nicest, and welcomed aspects of this small city is its beautiful river front walk. I have taken many a run along side the river, by  the hotels, and restaurants; by  the people riding their bikes or walking their dogs; and have even spotted woodchucks building their homes. It is a beautiful place to have a run, and if you keep going south on the Markell trail, you will run into the incredible nature preserves and spot more wildlife and incredible marshes. But my favorite part  is the Harriet Tubman statute at the North end of the river. Amazing historical reminder that this area was once central part of the Underground Railroad. "
Wilmington Riverwalk,4.0,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stayed at the Aloft and were thrilled to be right on this beautiful, unique and special part of Wilmington! After driving almost four hours and attending a dance show that evening, we were thrilled to spend time outside with the dog walking and meeting nice people from all over! There are plenty of restaurants nearby to stop for a good bite to eat or have a cocktail and enjoy even more of the River Walk."
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,Good wildlife,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed our visit in October! Bold and excited squirrels, not surprisingly considering many acorns on the ground. There was still a little running water in the creek, perhaps left over from the unusually wet winter or few unexpected summer storms. The trails on the north side are one of the best places to see wildlife in Southern California. This time, we startled two turkey vultures. They took off from the ground and flew low above us until we took the hint and moved away! The high clouds produced attractive colorful displays due to layers of ice crystals"
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,This turned out to be a really cool place.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I used to come here for summer YMCA Saturday night camp outs 55 years ago.  Have come here for Horseback riding and a couple of days out on the lake.  But today we had a nephew come for a visit, they live in Pine Grove, CA.  A long drive North, with their 2 sons, ages 6 and 4.  Not being around young children on a regular basis, it was a long, and tiring day.  But it was great to see them.  We took the train ride, went to the Zoo, walked by the Upper and Lower lakes and hit the playground.  This is a family oriented adventure."
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,We enjoyed the Irvine Regional Park.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had fun  at the Irvine Regional Park.
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,Great park not far from the city,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This park is a really nice one, pretty large and with good parking. Inside this park you can find the OC Zoo, an equestrian center, many picnic areas, a little lake and some more attractions. They have a farmer market once a week and always events and games set up for all the holidays during the year."
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,Huge Park with tons to do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Huge Park - you could get lost!  Definitely a great place to bring your bicycles.  There is a large lake where you can feed the ducks or try your hand at catching a few small fish.  In the summer they rent out pedal boats and such.  The boat house also offers rentals of pedal carts and other fun ride-ons.
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,Relaxing little Park when you need a break from Disneyland,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited the Irvine Regional Park on Saturday 2nd May, 2009. After spending two long days at Disneyland the previous two days, we found this little park a gem and a relaxing way to recharge the batteries. It was easy to get there in a car with a GPS, easy parking and we spent about 6 hours there.  We rode on the great little train around the park , the kids went on the pony rides, we hired tandum bikes and rode around the park, hired paddleboats and had some nice lunch.  There was some wildlife about the place that we would never see back home in Australia including squirrels and that made it a great relaxing little day.  It is not a big park by any means, the attached ZOO is very small but has a few good little enclosures with brown bears the highlight."
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,Entrance traffic horrible,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Why a park of this size has only one entrance is ridiculous. On a Saturday expect to wait 45 minutes to one hour to get through the pay station. There is no traffic control and people like to cut into the lane and expect you to let them in.
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,Country Trails Riding School,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Took the kids horseback riding at the horse ranch inside the park at CT Trail Rides for $45 an hour.  It was great!  The trail is very scenic and beautiful. The guide was friendly and fun!  You can also go for a 2 hr ride for $90.  They only take cash.  $5 entrance fee to the park. This attraction is inside the park grounds!  There are also private and group lessons.
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,AWESOME PARK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I have been coming to this park for over 25 years; this is my favorite park in Orange
Irvine Regional Park,4.5,Great Pumpkins!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took our granddaughter to the Irvine Regional Park for the Great Pumpkin Contest, where huge pumpkins were vying to be the pumpkin with the heaviest weight. Also, there were a Hay Maze, a pumpkin patch (where one may purchase pumpkins of various sizes), face painting, pumpkin decorating, and a small train ride. Pony rides were also offered.  Be advised, there is a $5 per vehicle fee to enter the Park."
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Great hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wonderful views.  Many hiking options off main trail.  Not too crowded.  Strenuous, but not too much so.  Jeep tours at top of trail a little annoying, but you can eavesdrop on tour guide to learn a little about the area. One of our favorite Sedona hikes "
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Favorite hike of the week,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Little Horse Trail to Chicken Point. Favorite hike of our week.  Not too crowded.  We enjoyed the stunning scenery and the peacefulness, the solitude. We went fairly early in the morning so weather was perfect.  Hike was pretty easy. Would do this one again."
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Easy Level Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a level, easy trail through the red rock area on Hwy 179.  The various trails in the area intersect so you can go from one to the other to extend your trip, or just do a short loop.  No shade so it is very hot on a sunny day. Also these trails are easy to get to and popular so they are fairly crowded."
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Lovely Trail to Chicken Point Lookout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Easy-moderate trail great for spending a few hours out on the trail. Option to add hike to Chapel of the Holy Cross. The trail was heavily trafficked with mountain bikers which were a little annoying at times but otherwise enjoyable. Beautiful views at Chicken Point.
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Great trail to an awesome view point: Chicken Point,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Firstly, I will say that we are not avid hikers and are relatively out of shape. It's a good day if I hit my goal of 8,000 steps! Hubs and I hiked this trail on a Sunday morning. Arrived around 9:30am and only saw a few others on the trail (more on the way back than on the way out). We really enjoyed the variety of flora along the path. There are some steeper sections, but they are fairly short. We only ran into bikers on our way back and found them to be polite. They let us know how many were behind them and thanked us for moving over. As we approached Chicken Point we could see some Pink Jeeps and people up there, but by the time we arrived, they had all moved on and we had the place to ourselves for about 2 minutes, then another PJ showed up. The quiet was nice, but it was also nice to have someone who could take our picture and to chat with other locals and travelers. Some bikers showed up and we watched some bike the white line. We easily spent at least 30 minutes at Chicken Point before descending back to the trail. "
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Start This Moderate Hike Earlier in the Day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This moderate hike takes you up about 300 feet in elevation and doesn't really have any shady spots. I recommend you start it as early in the day as you can because it got quite toasty for us on the trail during our mid-morning hike. The views of the red rocks are great along the trail, but especially at the end at Chicken Point. It is worth the extra effort to hike the whole trail to enjoy the amazing views from the top!"
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Sedona has worse traffic than Boston or NYC…,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"We tried to park in three different lots on 179 South, beginning with the lot for Little Horse Trail.  We got there around 12:30pm on a Tuesday, and had not read about any issues with crowds or traffic.  There is so little parking along 179 South, I would advise anybody looking to hike to head to the west of Sedona on 89.  After we tried the third lot, we gave up and got into the long single file line back up 179.  It took us 30 minutes to go about 2.5 miles, and make the left turn onto 89.  The road and parking infrastructure for Sedona seems not to have kept pace with the volume of tourism."
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Chicken Point a Must,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked from the little horse parking lot to chicken point.  We weren't sure what to expect and got a little discouraged along the way because it was hot with little to no shade.  But then the trail had a short uphill incline after about an hour hike and we were at the top of a huge rock (about half as tall as the mesa).  It was beautiful and the wind was funneling through the valley which felt great.  We had to hold onto our hats, it was so strong.  The scenery was absolutely stunning.  Great place for postcard pictures.  I would recommend this hike in the morning when it's cooler.  It was 3 miles roundtrip and took us about 2 1/2 hours, but 20 min or so was hanging out at the top.  Great Hike!!!"
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Nice hiking trail with great views of the mountains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is a parking lot for the Little Horse Trail. The lot does fill up and one time we left to go hike another area, and one day there were plenty of spots at Little Horse. Just depends on timing of the day and week."
Little Horse Trail,4.5,Nice view from Chicken Point!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is an easy-to-medium trail of roughly three miles roundtrip.  There are a couple of places where one must climb up 3-5 ft. high steep portions of the trail.  There will be a few mountain bikers and some other hikers, but all in all, it's a sweet trail.  Once you get to the bottom of Chicken Point, continue to the right side behind the point, and access it from the back.  The view is really nice!  The only drawback is that the Pink Jeep folks drive their customers up there (from a different access).  However, it's still a nice view and a nice hike."
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,Not What We Thought,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"With all the great reviews of this trail, we were hopeful for a repeat. Well, to say we were disappointed is an understatement. The trail beginning at the Niagara Gorge Discovery Center parking started pretty, but once we got into the trail itself going towards the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge that's when we began to change our take of the trail. Much of the trail was like walking on an alley, and the spots that did offer some great views were run down and dirty. Then the trail was closed for maintenance a few hundred yards past the aquarium. It wasn't worth the time."
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,"Oh, Those Views!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If this trail was in California, it would be too crowded to enjoy."
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,"If this were in Idaho, or Montana, or Arizona - everyone would be here",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I grew up in NF and hiked this trail quite often.  It is beautiful, tranquil, slightly challenging and almost completely private.  My husband who has visited several US National Parks and wonders was astounded that we passed but ONE person during our hour hike and then said the above - if this was in the middle of nowhere anywhere else in the country every tour book would talk about this."
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,Nice variety of trails for every level,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent 3 ½ hrs hiking the Niagara Gorge Rim, Whirlpool Rapids and Devils Hole trails starting at noon and ending at 3:30 on a Wed in mid July. Then we headed over to the Maid of the Mist and Cave of the Winds.  The timing was great. We probably saw less than 20 people the entire hike and we got right into Maid of the Mist and Cave of the Winds and saw tons of rainbows with the afternoon sun. "
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,more Gorge Trail info,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Friends were just asking me about the Trail as they are going to visit.  Thought I would update a few things -
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started by getting a map at the Discovery Center. Actually right outside there is a small building outside of the Discovery Center that you can go and get a map and more detailed info about trails , etc. We drove just down the road to whirlpool state park to begin our hike. Pay attention to the descriptions of the trails as far as difficulty and age requirement . They are pretty accurate . Beautiful and sometimes challenging walk depending on which route you take. Take water and have appropriate footwear. "
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,Disappear from the city and into the geology!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Once you've seen the cascading waters of Niagara, which are equally as beautiful from either side of the border, try this trail out.  You'll get an amazing view, up close sounds and smells of the water and foliage, and no people noise.  The throngs of visitors from all over the world apparently don't much like to hike, so this trail is usually pretty quiet...except of course for the roar of the waters.  A nice day hike!  Take a backpack lunch and make a day of it.  It's free -- you won't be sorry!"
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,Beautiful in Autumn!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Niagara Gorge Trail is an absolutely gorgeous place to visit and explore in the Autumn when all the trees are changing colors! The views of the gorge and Niagara River are breathtaking! Better wear your best footwear because the trail and steep stone steps in places is a bit rough and without proper footwear your safety may be compromised. For those who cannot travel up and down steep steps or go over uneven ground, the trail starts at the top and is fairly level along the first part for a small piece, but then gets a little more challenging, and the stone steps that go down to the gorge and river itself are quite steep and one has to be in decent shape to get down and then back up them! Absolutely worth it if you can manage physically!"
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,Beautiful but Dangerous!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been down in the Niagara Gorge many times in my life. We usually go down at Whirlpool State Park then come back up at Devil's Hole State Park then walk back to the car at the top of the gorge.There is much to see: closeups of the rapids, flora and fauna, rock formations, man made ""left behinds"". If you go here please remember that it can be a dangerous place. Stay on the trails and never go alone."
Niagara Gorge Trail,4.5,Great for hiking and outdoor enthusiasts!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We set aside one day of our week of vacation in the Niagara area to take this trail. We got there early and started at Whirlpool State Park. We went down the stairs there and went left at the bottom to see the whirlpool. The trail was fairly easy until we got closer to the whirlpool. There are 2 options to the trail there. The upper portion is fairly easy to traverse. We opted for the lower portion which gets you very close to the river. There are huge boulders to crawl over and some small crevices too. It's worth the exertion to be able to see the river and the whirlpool up close. The path is well marked with paint on the rocks. You can go fairly far. We didn't make it quite to the end, which I think is fairly close to the bridge. You will have to turn around and go back the same way you came, so keep that in mind while you are hiking. The later part of the trail, whether you take the upper or lower is climbing over rocks and boulders. The trails converge again after a bit. We opted for the upper trail loop on the way back, which was much quicker but not as neat a hike. When we got back to the stairs we continued on the trail at the river level to Devils Hole Park. This part of the trail is fairly easy, there are a few places where it's really narrow with a drop off to one side but only for a small portion. It's about 2 mile and you come to the 2nd staircase in Devils Hole Park. There are 400+ steps to go up and after an all day hike it was a tiring experience, but worth it. When we got to the top we had to take the ridge trail back to Whirlpool park but the ridge trail is very easy. We hiked a total of 7 miles that day and still had smiles on our faces."
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Loved riding bikes on this flat trail along the river,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I road bikes on this trail when visiting Raleigh.  The hotel had complimentary bikes.  We started at  mile 19 Pooles Rd and rode north to mile 10 and back.  The trail is very flat and paved.  Pretty water views along the way.  Saw walkers, but it's a better trail for bikes I think."
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Fantastic trail for all types of activity,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail is amazing spanning Wake County all the way to Johnston. Starts at Falls Dam and goes farther than I’ve yet to discover. Was able to train for many distance races of the half and full marathon variety. Course does not overwhelm with hills which is impressive considering the area. Plenty of access points in neighborhoods and running beside river is pretty cool experience. Only issue I have encountered is low spots can get a little wet and during cold months that means ice. 
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Loved the ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Started at the horseshoe farm nature preserve and we loved this trail.  Some small little inclines but I thought they were doable.  We only planned on riding for 2 hours as we were headed out to our next adventure.   Do plan to go back and do more.  It was about 92 degrees the day we rode.  Lots of shaded areas but when in the sun, it was really hot so bring your hydration with you."
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Hiking vs Biking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If this is your first visit,  I recommend you start just below Falls Dam.  Do not do like I  did and select Neuse River Trail Parking from your Google search because this does not start you at the beginning of the trail and you will miss the prettiest part of the river just below the dam.  "
Neuse River Trail,5.0,My Favorite City Oasis ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I’m fortunate enough to live where the Neuse River Trail section of Raleigh’s Capital Area Greenway is practically in my back yard. This natural area that weaves with paved trails for dozens of miles along the Neuse River is my favorite destination for walking, biking, and soon, test driving my brand new river tube. There are just a few access points for parking cars so weekends can get busy. And for river users, put in / take out points for canoes, kayaks and tubes are woefully lacking. But for a nature fix in the middle of urbana, the Neuse River Trail is top notch. "
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Nice afternoon ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I rented a bike and rode the trail for a while. It is really nice. The trail is paved and runs along the river. It is marked very well toward streets and parking lots, so you can find your way back to your car. It was very nice to ride a bike along the river and I never crossed a street in 10 miles. There is a bike rental place at the trail head. It was a great nature break on my trip. Lots of people walking and riding bikes. "
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Difficult to find,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The walkway and river was pretty and well used, but we had to ask around to find it. There is so little signage or literature about it. I asked at the visitor center and got a blank look and an ""I don't know anything about a trail"". Wow. And it wasn't that far from there! Maybe it's a secret."
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Great bike trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My husband and I did 26 miles on this trail and it was beautiful. Overhanging trees gave us a lot of shade while riding. There was a soccer park along the way that had bathrooms and water. The trail was wide and plenty of room for passing bikers. This is one of the best rails we have ridden on and I highly recommend it for bikers or walkers. 
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Beautiful Trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I love to walk and this is the best place to do it! The trail is scenic and serene, and the trail is long to accommodate any amount of exercise you're up for.  There's lots of shade trees so you're not hiking in the direct sun.  Plenty of room for bike riders to use the path, too.  Try it - you'll love it!"
Neuse River Trail,5.0,Well maintained,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Walked this trail twice; once from the South and North ends, I have to say  I was not disappointed. It is well maintained and scenic. It is also well used, bikers, joggers and walkers. It is flatter walking from the North end and more scenic and we enjoyed that more. The bathrooms are ample and more opportunities to stop and rest on a bench. Wish it was in my neck of the woods. "
Monon Trail,4.5,Sketchy Portion of Monon Trail on a Bike,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rode from Benjamin Harrison State Park on Fall Creek to connect to Monon Trail Northbound. Trail is detoured around construction on the Monon Trail near the Marion County Fairgrounds. Monon is diverted around the concrete forms being staged for what appeared ramps for bridges over a congested street. The trail becomes hazardous when detoured through a rundown neighborhood with very bad pavement that has deteriorated. A yellow Chevy Corvette Stingray tried to run me off the road head on, I heard some verbal abuse, and a subsequent vehicle followed me while I road back onto a fenced portion where cars can't fit. Recommendations: Avoid Monon trail near the Marion County Fairgrounds. Not safe."
Monon Trail,4.5,Crowded urban trail best avoided,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Monon Trail goes about 30 miles from Downtown Indy out to the small town of Sheridan, Indiana.  The Carmel stretch is by far the worst section, especially the MidTown area.  A concrete jungle where trail users (including the bar & restaurant patrons) generally act self-absorbed (snooty) showing NO consideration for those around them.  Like (seemingly deliberately) obstructing others by ignoring trail use signs (for the separate walk, bike and car lanes), stopping in the middle of the trail rather than stepping to the side, or having their dog leashes stretch across the whole trail. And watch for motorists downtown that seem to enjoy roaring their engines, squealing their tires, and threatening folks crossing on Main Street. North to Westfield or South to Indy (Broad Ripple or further South to the Cultural Trail) are MUCH better experiences- including the trail-side bars/restaurants in Indy (although Westfield near Grand Park has some too)."
Monon Trail,4.5,A must do in Carmel,5.0 of 5 bubbles,So much fun! Rent a bike or bring your own. Great way to see this family friendly city. There is also a cool microbrewery bar along the path you can stop at to have a drink and hear a little outdoor music.
Monon Trail,4.5,A walk in the country but in the city!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We walk here several times a week from Spring thru Fall.  It is a greenbelt right in the middle of the city.   Beautiful!
Monon Trail,4.5,Smash and grab robbery at Monon Trailhead past weekend,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a lovely ride on the Monon Trail and and brunch this past weekend in Broad Ripple only to return to our car parked near the 86th Street Trailhead and find that our car window had been smashed and all of our belongings stolen. Police indicated that this happens from time to time, watch where you park!"
Monon Trail,4.5,A Riders Delight,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I am an active cyclist and the Monon Trail that goes North of Carmel all the way to Indianapolis is a pure delight. My main route is from Zionsville thru Carmel where I catch the Monon @ 136th street and south to Broad Ripple to the Butler University area. The trail offers so much not just for the cyclist,the Rollerblade enthusiast, the Jogger and the good ol' walker. Along its way one can find many eateries, shops (bicycle aplenty), rest areas with bathrooms, benches and scenic sights. One of the most remarkable moments for me has been the assistance, the concern, suggestions whenever I faced a bike malfunction, normally a flat tire, that proves the Hoosier hospitality is alive and well. The Monon in Carmel offers more than just rest stops, eateries, etc but the Arts as well and skate board park, swimming pools and bike rentals. Both the City of Carmel, Indianapolis, Westfield and soon to be Noblesville are commended for bringing and continuing this marvel and its cultural diversity to the masses. The ride along the canal in Broad Ripple is stunning and relaxing and if your hungry by this time there places to eat aplenty. The Indianapolis Police Department Horse Patrol and cycling police officers make it comforting to know that your safety is a main concern. Family riders, individual riders,  team riders all can be found on the Monon ""Stretch."" It's fun, safe and most important very healthy entertainment for any age and I have seen from newborns to geriatrics partaking this magnificent spectacle. So what are you waiting for? Like the saying you seen many a time, ""Just Do It!"""
Monon Trail,4.5,Best trail in Indiana,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Been on about every trail in Illinois and wanted to try the Monon and Indiana Cultural Trail.  This trail does not disappoint.  Many places to stop for both pictures and food galore.  Great beauty in the fall and easy to follow markers.  A must if looking for walking, running, biking in central Indiana! "
Monon Trail,4.5,A gem for the city,5.0 of 5 bubbles,People keep their distance but we enjoy it together.   So awesome to go out and walk away from traffic. 
Monon Trail,4.5,monon trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Monon trail is use to be a rail road and now it is popular wolk path between Indianapolis and its northern suburbs.
Monon Trail,4.5,Gorgeous walk. Fun casual restaurants,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had a great time here. A lively place to walk. Several places to grab a bite along trail.  We had a very relaxing experience. You don't have to be a power Walker. Plenty of slow walkers as well as runners share trail amicably. 
Blue Mesa,5.0,Out-of-this-world landscape!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a place! Like walking on another planet.. This was one of the highlights of our visit, along with the Painted Desert Rim Trail."
Blue Mesa,5.0,Unique landscape,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was one of my favorite places in the Painted Desert and the most unique.
Blue Mesa,5.0,Beautiful Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The pay off is big if you choose to hike down to this trail.  The trail is paved and has informational signs to tell you more about what you are viewing.  The colors are gorgeous and the terrain is very unique.  I enjoyed this trail a great deal.
Blue Mesa,5.0,"Quiet, pretty trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is paved the entire way. It starts by going downhill, then when you get down to the Mesa you will start on a loop. There is lots of petrified wood around. There are a few signs that offer information about the rock formations around. At the end you go up again back to the parking lot. There is no sign by the road that says “Blue Mesa Trail” so you need to know where you’re going. There is a small wall with a stairway where you park for this trail. "
Blue Mesa,5.0,Highly Recommend the Historic Blue Forest Trail to see Blue Mesa,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Blue Mesa Trail in Petrified Forest is one of the best ways to see the beautiful blue, pink, gray and purple hills.  This trail is a 1 mile paved trail with 108 feet elevation gain.  It took us 30 minutes to complete and there is some uphill and downhill.  We visited Petrified Forest on Saturday, October 23.  If you are up for more adventure and would like a hike with very few people, consider the Historic Blue Forest Trail.  You can find this trail on AllTrails.  It is 2.6 miles and you can walk up and down the hills with amazing views."
Blue Mesa,5.0,Worth a side trip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Petrified Forest National Park is one of those of those parks where (should you have a limited amount of time) you can see the essentials by traveling along the main park road.  My wife and I only had about a half day to visit, so one of the decisions that faced us was whether or not we should venture off the main road to see Blue Mesa.  We ended up deciding to do so, and we’re glad we did.  You can reach Blue Mesa via a spur road about halfway through the park; it’s about a 5 mi/8 km round trip."
Blue Mesa,5.0,Don't Miss This,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I'll just add my sentiments to the others that have said it was their favorite at Petrified Forest National Park. If you have a limited amount of time and are having to pick and choose which things to see....make sure you choose this as one of them.
Blue Mesa,5.0,Worth the stop!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Justed loved this. It is so different than our mid-west landscape. It was so nice to have full sun and mild temperature in February rather than feet of snow and gray skies. Wonderful short hikes into the interesting landscapes.
Blue Mesa,5.0,Beautiful Sight,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did not hike the trail. We walked a bit and then turned back because of timing, but I did not have to hike the whole trail to know that this area in the park was an amazing location. The colors and formations can be seen from the road and it is quite a sight to behold. Don’t miss the Blue Mesa when visiting the Petrified Forest National Park"
Blue Mesa,5.0,The best hike in the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is it. If you have time for only one hike, this is the one I would take. As you walk the trail, you descend into another world. I have never seen anything like it. This was our first hike in the park. Afterwards, we hiked the Crystal Forest and Logs. Those trails had more petrified wood but did not have the other-worldly landscape."
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Worth the walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I really liked these falls.  The trail is pretty short and not difficult.  Yeah there are some roots and some planks that are kind of worn over some muddy spots, but well worth it for the falls.  There is a bench there to sit in appreciation.  Since you can see the dam around the bend, I’d imagine these don’t slow down much and you can see the full grandeur.  We visited in late July, there were a couple mosquitoes in the forest, but not overwhelming."
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Hiking the Kawishiwi Falls Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great trip! We arrived at approximately 4 pm and made our way towards the entrance of the trail. The trail was roughly a 1 mile round trip, and moderate in difficulty. There were some steep inclines throughout the course of the trail. We were surrounded by the beautiful colors of fall as we hiked the trail. The view of the waterfall itself was breathtaking, and there were even several benches available along the trail, to sit and admire the scenery. There were also several informational plaques on the trail, giving us some background on the falls."
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Great Local Waterfall and Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,You can hike to these falls in less than 30 minutes. The hike is moderate. The falls are beautiful! The scenery is beautiful. There are signs that describe the area. It is free to hike here. You learn that they also produce electricity at these falls. Would definitely come back!
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful hike.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Perfect length hike for middle aged folks, kids, dogs and those who enjoy nature and waterfalls. Can get a little bumpy with lots of rocks, roots and slopes in the hike. Older folks and those with disabilities or difficulty walking might have some trouble. The falls were beautiful and there was a bench to sit and rest once you got to the falls."
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful short hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Definitely put this on your bucket list if you have never been to Ely or are short on time but want to do a hike. Seeing the tree roots growing on rocks is neat. Seeing the falls are amazing. Easy hike but do wear proper shoes. 
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Went twice!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My 13yo daughter’s favorite part of our Ely trip! We went at sunset twice because she loved it so much the first time. 
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,An unexpected beauty in the middle of all these lakes.  We were not expecting such a large water fall in this area.  It is an easy hike for almost any age and there are some great views as well as historical information at the end of the hike.
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Great trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really liked this trail! It has a bit of elevation and difficulty to it - so at the end you feel like you did something - but is not unreasonably challenging by any means. The whole trail in and out is just under 2 miles. The waterfall is beautiful at the end, and the trail there is peaceful and wooded and had a decent amount of wildflowers when we visited at the end of May. Would definitely recommend for a quick local hike."
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Wear hiking boots!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiked the trail after several inches of snow had fallen and (mostly) melted.  Rugged trail with many roots, rocks, boulders and some mud.  I suggest a walking stick!  Well worth the 1/2 mile trek in to see the beautiful falls.  Nice sitting area at the falls."
Kawishiwi Falls Trail,4.5,Such a Pretty Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a mostly flat trail that is accessible for most people (the trail includes a lot of roots, rocks, and wooden boardwalks).  The payoff is a grand view of Kawishiwi Falls.  The views are gorgeous and well-worth the short hike."
Long Creek Falls,4.5,A really nice short falls hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a nice little hike with a great falls experience at the end. You will be on the Appalachian Trail for most of the hike. The hike to the falls is about one mile and is mostly on an upward incline. The drive into the trailhead is 5 miles on a forestry road. It is mostly in good shape but does have some bumpy spots with mud holes. Most vehicles should be able to make it. We saw sedans and mini-vans.
Long Creek Falls,4.5,Worth the hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fun trip! Got stuck in a thunderstorm the first attempt. We were half way to the waterfall and decided to turn around due to heavy rains. The trail became very slippery. Although it rained, it was a fun adventure. We went back the next day and had a wonderful time! Hike is doable (I’m out of shape) and both kids were able to do it (3 and 6 years old). The end result is a beautiful waterfall!"
Long Creek Falls,4.5,Beautiful falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very scenic trail to hike with the beautiful falls at the end.  Some areas have a lot of roots and rocks to navigate along with some hills so I would say it is a moderately difficult hike for a novice.  Very long gravel road to get to the trailhead, but it is very beautiful as the road follows the scenic river."
Long Creek Falls,4.5,Great Hike for Family and Pets,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great little hike for families with children and dogs. Just two miles round-trip and easy hiking to a nice waterfall. Good to go during the week as I’ve heard it gets crowded on weekends. The road to the falls was not bad at all. We did it in a Honda Accord with no problem, whatsoever. Definitely worth the trip if you are looking for a short, easy hike."
Long Creek Falls,4.5,"Beautiful falls, Slippery rocks",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The gravel road isn’t fun but it’s not terrible, we made it through fine in a Honda Civic. The trail is not very long and the waterfall is beautiful. I’m pretty out of shape, but even I thought the uphill part wasn’t too bad. My partner did dislocate their shoulder after slipping on a Boulder, so that was a low point. We went around 11 and didn’t see anyone on the way to the falls, but plenty of people on the way back. Morning seems like a better time to go. My partners shoulder is fine now, and we got some interesting memories."
Long Creek Falls,4.5,Nice Waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Don’t buy the negative reviews. It’s an easy hike and the road is not that bad. It is a gravel road and you have to watch out for pot holes. It will add about 30 minutes to your trip each way. The road follows a great trout steam most of the way and offers some nice views. The waterfall itself is great. We left the Cabin early and arrived 7:00am. We left around 8:30am. We didn’t see a soul on the hike in or the hike out on a weekend day. Do yourself a favor and go early.
Long Creek Falls,4.5,Beautiful Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"""Easy"" and fun hike to a beautiful waterfall. Being from Florida and used to flat land, this uphill hike definitely wore me out! However, the 1-mile hike was great for beginners like me and led to a great view. When we got there, my husband enjoyed cooling off by swimming in the waterfall. I was thankful for the downhill hike back to the car! There were several little paths off the main path that led to little falls and running water. These were pretty, but made the hike more difficult. The drive to get to the parking area was a trek - if you think you are lost you're probably on the right path! Definitely would recommend this hike if you are in the area!"
Long Creek Falls,4.5,Dirt road,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Will be going in 3 weeks! Cant wait! How is the 5 mile dirt road for a hyundai elantra? I read mixed reviews on it. Is there well marked signs to the waterfall?
Long Creek Falls,4.5,SPECTACULAR - GO IN THE OFF SEASON - READ THIS FIRST FOR DIRECTIONS!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went on this hike Dec 22 w/ our 2 kids, 9 & 11. Getting to the trailhead not too complicated, but take note, the location shown in TripAdvisor is wrong - it is a bit more ""in the middle of nowhere"", same as Toccoa Swinging Bridge - the location shown in Google maps is correct. If you put ""Long Creek Falls"" in google maps app in your Iphone, will take you straight there - LOAD WHILE YOU STILL HAVE CELL SIGNAL - ONCE YOU GET DOWN ASKA RD, NO SIGNAL AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO LOAD."
Long Creek Falls,4.5,"Waterfall & Appalachian Trail Experience near Blue Ridge, GA",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"From Blue Ridge, Ga it is about a 35-40 minute drive but well worth it for a dose of the real unspoiled North Georgia Mountains. It's a beautiful drive along scenic Noontootla Creek in the national forest to a small parking area where the Appalachian Trail crosses this forest service road. This area is called Three Forks or the Long Creek Trailhead for the Appalachian Trail. Park in this area (not well marked but somewhat obvious when you get there as there are only camping spots along the way otherwise) and walk the historic Appalachian Trail for about 1 mile or less to Long Creek Falls. "
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,Riverwalk Trail is nice to Walk or Bike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We unloaded our E-Bikes and rode the whole Riverwalk For a total of 10.3 Miles. From the Maritime museum east is less traffic & businesses etc, going towards the west end you have to pay attention to vehicles, businesses etc more. It’s a nice easy ride."
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,Great views along the Riverwalk!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Riverwalk is officially 6.4 miles from Smith Point on the west side to Lagoon Road on the east. It offers something for everyone as it goes right through the business/restaurant/brewery areas going east to the edge of town. I stayed at the Hampton Inn which is right on the Riverwalk so each morning there are lots of opportunities to go for a few mile stroll. Bicycles/walkers/runners are all welcome. All along the Riverwalk you’ll see ships of all sizes going up and down the Columbia River. Absolutely beautiful scenery! Now if the weather was not the cool, misty, drizzle it’d be perfect. Highly recommend a stroll especially starting east and walking west so the bridge connecting Oregon to Washington is always in view!"
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,Pleasant Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice paved path to walk along the river and into town. Stop and see the sea lions - you'll certainly hear them from a distance away. We were there in the early evening and it was very pleasant. Although our Airbnb host assured us it's safe, I don't believe there is any lighting along the path so I probably wouldn't roam around here after dark."
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,A gem!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Really loved this walking path! A great way to view the river and the town. It certainly helped that I was there on a beautiful sunny day with the salty sea breeze welcoming me. Easy flat grade and goes past many places to stop. I’d love to bike it or take the trolley; maybe next time!
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,Awesome River Stroll,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The river walk in Astoria is so much fun. I did not do the whole thing, but what was done was great. The part I went through goes by a lot of piers with great views of the Columbia. Lots of interpretive signs gives you a great perspective and history of Astoria. Not a lot of great photo opportunities for the bridge, but plenty for the river and the big ships. You can easily spend a good part of the day seeing everything including the Nordic Park. Whatever one decides, it will be a good time."
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,Drug addicts/homeless,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Drug addicts along path. If they could get a handle on that problem it would be great. Neat restaurants, view, wildlife. "
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,"Great resource, needs more policing and maintenance",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We work right on the Riverwalk and use it regularly to walk to lunch and to walk our dogs. When the city first established it, it was so much better, but has steadily declined over time. It's still a nice resource to have, but I think between the dog poop and the growing presence of homeless people, often intimidating and with dogs off-leash, I'm using it less and less. "
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,A great walk into town - never did see the trolley though,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Lovely walk into town from the Cannery Hotel.  We never did see any trolley so be sure you have the energy to make it back.  Please be careful when walking on the trestle - my friend slipped into one of the slats in her canvas shoe and really hurt herself.  Make sure you walk along the side when you reach these couple of spots as its a very easy accident to happen.  
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,Pretty Walk along the Waterfront,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I walked to the maritime museum and back to the cruise port on the Riverwalk.  It was a lovely, sunny, warm fall day.  Parts of the trail are interesting - there are maritime artifacts, old waterfront building (mostly repurposed), some residential buildings, bridges... just a pleasant and fairly long place to get your 10,000+ steps!  The bonus is the Maritime museum at the end (which I reviewed also). The bridges are shared with the local (and I believe, free) trolley, so be aware of that.  It seems very safe, at least during the day. We met several friendly locals and their dogs.  the Riverwalk provides a nice view of the town.  Recommended for sure!"
Astoria Oregon Riverwalk,4.5,Most cozy walk in Northern Oregon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This river walk is a lot of fun.  You get to see many boats and many birds while enjoying a beautiful bridge.  Then along the path you will find breweries, ice cream shops and museums.  I recommend hopping on the trolley to go through the river walk AND walk the path afterwards."
Cabrillo Bike Path,4.5,Great bike path!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved this bike path!  We were in Santa Barbara on vacation and took an afternoon to ride bikes along this bike path.  Loved riding along the beach!  Very scenic and very peaceful.  We all rode individual bikes, although there were several four person bikes on the path.  At times it was hard to pass those bikes as it could be a very busy path.  The path was well marked as well.  Overall, a great experience."
Cabrillo Bike Path,4.5,Beautiful on a Sunny Day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great place to walk on a nice day.   A lot of restaurants, shops and hotels along  the way to explore.  The weekend are busy and the Sunday craft market is fun to stroll through.  The sunrise was beautiful to see from this area."
Cabrillo Bike Path,4.5,Biek ride with 8 and 9 yr olds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"View is unbeatable. Only challenge is the nimrods...the clueless folks who do not look when crossing the path, are biking too fast or are otherwise annoying. Those folks are everywhere, but would be careful with young riders. Kids loved the ride."
Cabrillo Bike Path,4.5,"Great ocean-side pathway, though access a little tricky",4.0 of 5 bubbles,The Cabrillo pathway runs along the side of the beach and ocean to and past most of the main ocean-front attractions in the city.  It's well-used by bikes and skaters and can get a bit congested at weekends and on holidays; but generally it works well.  Getting onto it can be a bit of a mission with a big bike as entry points aren't well signed so we just tracked across the grass to the side and joined the flow of people on the path.
Cabrillo Bike Path,4.5,Wonderful biking or walking from Shoreline Park to Butterfly Beach (or farther),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This ""bike"" path is fabulous for biking OR walking.  If biking, it is relatively flat and easy even for geriatric bikers.  We start at the far west end of Shoreline Park and bike along the beaches, past the Andree Clark reserve, turn at the sign to the Music Academy of the West and continue to follow the path past Ty Warner's mansion all the way to the Four Seasons Biltmore.  You can go farther, all the way to Carpenteria if you like.  On the way back to Shoreline Park, we reward ourselves with lunch or a snack (and maybe a drink) at Shoreline Cafe!  If walking, start at Stearns Wharf and either go east to the East Beach Bathhouse (now under construction) or west to the harbor and out the the breakfront.  On Sunday, there is a crafts fair from Stearns Wharf to the Bathhouse."
Cabrillo Bike Path,4.5,Great Bike Path to View Beautiful Santa Barbara,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented bikes and rode for about three hours first south towards Montecito then back north up the Mesa and into Hope Ranch, returning via Modoc and Upper State Street.  The bike path itself is quite easy as most of it is flat and offers extraordinary views of the coast on one side and beautiful Santa Bar and surroundings on the other side.  Well worth the ride."
Cabrillo Bike Path,4.5,GREAT Bike Path!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Definitely grab a couple of beach cruisers and take a ride.  Stop off at Sambo's for breakfast of Breakwater at the harbor.  Super easy and FUN!!!

Kal Haven Trail,4.5,Pleasant ride,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Many years ago we pedaled the entire Kal-Haven trail from South Haven to Kalamazoo. We did not try that again, but used the Kal-Haven as an extension of our ride on the Van Buren State Park Trail. Kal-Haven is crushed limestone, so not as smooth as trails that are blacktopped. But the signage for the trail is exceptional and takes you through the downtown of South Haven. Trail seems to be well maintained."
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,Long Tree Lined Dusty Trail,3.0 of 5 bubbles,My friends and family rode the 34 mile crushed lime stone trail from Kalamazoo to South Haven.  The loss from the Zoo to the Haven is 344 feet.  There are some gradual  inclines and some declines with some sandy spots that could get a little dicey for road bikes.  The trail is mostly tree lined so you probably wont need your sunglasses.  
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,Long Straight Path.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rode 12 miles from South Haven to Grand Junction, had a bite to eat in Grand Junction at the local greasy spoon (it was good), and then rode back to South Haven.  Path is crushed stone, packed tight, path.  Straight line path.  Almost the entire path is shaded by trees.  A few others on the path (it was a saturday morning) but not enough to call it crowded at all.  We saw maybe forty other bike riders in 24 miles.  It was an easy path that we both enjoyed riding, but there wasn't much to see other than trees.   Grand Junction was an actual ""town' to stop in a get a bite to eat.  The other towns in between had nothing to stop and look at.  No complaints, but I'm an avid bike rider, and was beginning to become bored.  Would I do it again?  yes... but I'd plan a whole day and ride the entire trail, stopping for lunch in Kalamazoo, and then heading back.  Your bike will get very dusty.  Be prepared to clean your bike and drive train when you are done."
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,Shaded activity to spend the daye,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were visiting Van Buren State park and were looking for a trail - deciding between the two main options in the area. We decided to check out this trail as it sounded much more interesting and unique. We headed off East along the trail, not really sure of what to expect or how long we would ride for. We were told about a cafe to check out in the town of Grand Junction."
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We use this trail every year to walk our dog while on vacation at South Haven.  It's so beautiful and quiet.  There are a lot of bike riders on the path but they just let you know that they are behind you and then go around you.  The path is crushed limestone and pretty wide.  There are also mile markers along the way and benches to use for a rest.
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,Wonderful First Ride!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Two of us cycled 10 miles from South Haven and then turned back.  What a relaxing ride.  The paths are well groomed and shaded by numerous beautiful trees.  We were able to ride side by side and move over when others approached.
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,It is a tradition to bike ride this for our wedding anniversary.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We ride about 10 miles out from South Haven and stop at Grand Junction for lunch at Country Fare and then ride back to South Haven.  Great trail with beautiful country views.  Primarily flat and even trail.  Well maintained.
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,Quiet and lovely trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were a bit leery of it being ""crushed stone"", but it was so hard packed we had no issues at all with our road bikes.  We started in South Haven and rode as far as Gobles and had no issues with the trail being too rough or rutted.  We thoroughly enjoyed it and want to come back and finish the rest of the trail.  Not much along the way as far as towns, etc. to grab food/drink, but we did find a bar in Gobles.  "
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,Major Construction Ongoing,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"I walked the trail on September 15, 2023 and found the trail to be bulldozed, as a reconstruction is underway. I walked from South Haven to the first covered bridge that is east of the highway. I am not sure how far the construction goes. It is wise to check before you make plans, as it appears that this project may take awhile."
Kal Haven Trail,4.5,First time back in a long time,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Always a great place to take a long walk or a bike ride.  It is quiet and there is no telling what you will see.  I saw several people walking their pets and several other joggers not to mention several bikers.  Besides the geese and squirrels I saw a large red fox which was a nice surprise.  I even came across a father fishing with his son under the 196 overpass and they were making their own memories.  I only walked 3 miles on this trip but plan on being back with my bike to ride further on the trail.
Clover Brooke Farm Llama Alpaca Hikes,5.0,Wonderful hike with alpacas!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband, daughter and I had the pleasure of hiking with alpacas yesterday.  Our host Andrea was wonderful. Although it is a farm with fiber being the business, she is absolutely dedicated to her animals. Walking along the side of my alpaca was truly a unique and awesome experience.  I highly recommend this tour during these COVID times since it is outdoors and amenable to social distancing. Plus....it is open year round.  Highly recommend."
Clover Brooke Farm Llama Alpaca Hikes,5.0,good,4.0 of 5 bubbles,i enjoyed being in the farm.. it was a lovely small farm.. wish there was a cafe or things we can eat at least supermarket snacks and general visit to the store in specific opening times and the farm not only paid experiences. I did the soap workshop but it was very long instructions session full of informations like 90 minutes of talk.i attached soap picture of me and my friend. wish there was more options of essential oil and colors in the workshop.
Clover Brooke Farm Llama Alpaca Hikes,5.0,A beautiful day with lasting memories,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I attended the beginners soap making class. I was provided with instructions and supplies needed for this class and the knowledge and confidence to make soap by myself at home. Andrea was patient and kind and answered all of my questions.  I really enjoyed my experience and would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys an interesting workshop and loves animals. I plan on participating in many more classes at the farm and have asked all my friends to join me.
Clover Brooke Farm Llama Alpaca Hikes,5.0,Overpriced for what we got,2.0 of 5 bubbles,We did the warm and fuzzy experience. We were able to pet 6 bunnies and 1 chicken (which was not friendly and was running around like it lost its head). We also walked Hal the alpaca.  The leader was not able to answer many questions and didn’t give us a full experience. People were leaving early - we really had nothing to do after 35 min. And the shop was closed. Not worth the $28 per person for us. I’m surprised with all of the 5 star reviews. Seemed like a way to make a lot of money to pet a bunny (because that’s all we really could do).
Clover Brooke Farm Llama Alpaca Hikes,5.0,Their Kids Farm Camp is a home run!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My daughter LOVED her camp experience here. Andrea and crew assign farm chores and hands-on animal care to the kids everyday. Llama and alpaca feeding, watering, hikes, bunny grooming, chicken care, even fishing! She also has the kids create their own farm from cardboard and other materials and give a presentation to the parents explaining how it will work, from what animals they will farm, what will they sell and how will they sell it. If your child loves animals and loves to be busy, this is a home run. Andrea is kind and calm and the kids love her. We have been to numerous camps in the area that advertise similar farm-hand experiences but Clover Brook Farm actually delivers an authentic day on the farm, I highly recommend it!"
Clover Brooke Farm Llama Alpaca Hikes,5.0,Such a fun day! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Such a wonderful fun day spent on the farm, we started off with visiting the smaller animals on the farm which were baby goats, chickens, alpacas, and the barn kitty Rascal! Andrea was a wonderful guide, gave the girls some awesome information about the animals and they asked her some questions as well. The hike was really nice, pretty mild hike, not hard at all. At the top we stopped for photos which was nice. The farm is beautifully kept and has so much history, we enjoyed it so much! "

Clover Brooke Farm Llama Alpaca Hikes,5.0,Granddaughters third birthday ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited the farm this past Sunday to celebrate my granddaughters third birthday. Her two year old sister was also with us. We all had a ball interacting with the Llamas and Alpacas, the animals are so well behaved and Andrea the owner of the farm was an encyclopedia of knowledge. Beside the llamas and alpaca there were goats and a rabbit they were able to pet and they even fed the chickens! No one wanted to leave! We will definitely visit again. I highly recommend this activity for kids of all ages. Thanks again Andrea! "

We spent an hour outdoors walking the grounds of the farm in the company of two adorable donkeys, Lee and Joy. In the process, thanks to our lovely guide Mayerly, we learned a lot about the farm in general and about its animals. The owners are doing an exception job, and Mayerly's enthusiasm was truly contagious."
Clover Brooke Farm Llama Alpaca Hikes,5.0,Incredible afternoon!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a wonderful experience. The owner is knowledgeable, kind, and enthusiastic. The hike is the perfect length to get to know your llama or alpaca, and the time visiting the other animals on the farm was lovely. I highly recommend this farm!"
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,A real Desert wonderland in the middle of nowhere.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed the hike and the Greenhouse.  Coupled with the McDonald Observatory and the rebuilt Fort Davis itself, right in the middle of town, The area is really a worthwhile place to drive out of the way to see.  Food is available, if not great, but I highly recommend the Fort Jefferson Davis Area as a unexpectedly educational and entertaining place to visit."
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,Beautiful Views and Trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The nature center is worth a morning of hiking and learning about the plane species of the Davis Mountains. There are several trails around 2 miles in length- in the gorge or on the cliff.  There is also a nature trail with various cacti and plants.  The small indoor space has plaques explaining the formation of the area and a small gift shop.  Bring lots of water and snacks for the hike.
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,Great spot for all ages--,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've driven by this center several times without noticing it--is a great spot for adults and children of all ages.  We had eight of our grandchildren, ages 6-16, and every one of them enjoyed the park and hike.  The center staff are helpful and friendly, the building has good restrooms and a little shop, and the map is easy to read."
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,A fun outing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed hiking the Outside Loop Trail, which offers a variety of rocky trails and scenic views. Afterwards we walked the botanical gardens and visited the cactus greenhouse,spending about 2 1/2 hours in all.  Staff was friendly and very informed.  It was difficult to make online reservations from Indian Lodge due to spotty wifi, but we later learned that wifi is very good at the Nature Center, so you can pay  for your tickets that way after you arrive."
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,Great place to spend a few hours while in the Ft. Davis area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was my coastal Texas family's first visit to the area, and the main draw was a star party at the McDonald Observatory. That was a wonderful experience, but we enjoyed this nature center just as much. We were staying at Indian Lodge (loved it-will do a separate review). After exploring Ft. Davis, hiking in Davis Mountain State Park, and the star party, we had a free day to fill. Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center is very well maintained with easy trails for those of us (me) who weren't up to another strenuous hike. Trees and plants have identification markers, the views are gorgeous, it's great for birding, the staff was friendly and helpful, and there is a very nice (and wonderfully air conditioned) information center/gift shop. Take refillable bottles-there is a water filing station in the info center. Our group was ages 30 to 66, and I think children would enjoy it just as much as we did. Thank you to Indian Lodge for including this on the ""things to do in the area"" list!"
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,Avoid this,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"We drove in from Dallas to see this sites of west Texas. We followed the sign to this place after going to the Davis Mountain State park. I walked  in the door of the visitor center and this chick greets us with "" did you get a ticket?"" I respond I just walked in the door!! "
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,What a gem!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,After driving for 6+ hours I was looking for a place to get in a quick hike and take in the scenery. This place was absolutely beautiful! I did the outer loop trail in just over an hour - which included many photo opportunities and time to sit and enjoy. This trail offered some rougher terrain so it please this seasoned hiker.
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,Be sure to book in advance,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed our visit to this terrific facility, and appreciate so much the great staff and the time they took to answer our questions.     For a true botany enthusiast any time of year is a great time to visit a botanical garden, but for others they may prefer to visit at a time when the garden is blooming.   We enjoyed the garden, the cactus greenhouse, the mining exhibit, and the bird hide.    We would have spent more time if the facilities were not closed due to Covid.    Also, because of this please be sure to book your visit ahead of time!   We look forward to our return!"
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,Very enjoyable and educational,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A very nice man in Marfa recommended this to us and we are so grateful he did. There is a very nice visitor centre called the Powell Visitor Centre with a beautiful front porch that looks very inviting but the best part of our visit was learning about the protection of a very fragile ecosystem and the many types of cactus, truly amazing to us. There is scenic walk thru the botanical garden and the cactus museum is fascinating. The scenery is just beautiful and its very peaceful."
Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center & Botanical Gardens,4.5,What a find in the Davis Mountains ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wow! What a find! Botanical gardens, bird-watching, and hiking in the Davis Mountains. Mining history exhibit and nature center, too. If you've been to the McDonald Observatory, wear your tour sticker; they even offered us discount because I had mine still on my jacket from the Star Party the night before. Our only regret? That we didn't have more time. We were there 3 hours, but literally could have spent all day."
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,Definitely Worth Getting Tickets and Seeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Everyone says this is a must if you are visiting Acadia National Park and I agree.  You must by tickets to get access up the mountain path since they limit access of visitors throughout the day.  It is a larger walking area to see all different angles of the surrounding land and sea. Granite rocks to walk across and nice to bring up a lunch or meal for a picnic.  LOVED IT!
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,"""Have To Do"" hike if you're national park fan",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you're a hiker and national park fan, the ""have to do"" thing if you visit Acadia is doing this trail pre-dawn to witness the sunrise. it will be the story you tell others about when you go home, especially if you get to watch a cloud-free sunrise over the horizon from the summit after your hike up."
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,White out conditions,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a 9:30 am reservation and unfortunately we were informed by the Ranger that there were white out conditions.  The top of the mountain was covered with fog, it was very windy and there were no views. We walked down the trail a bit, but then decided to turn back and not do the trail due to the conditions. I am sure that the views are are spectacular and the trail an amazing hole but not in this particular day."
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,Highlight of my whole trip!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Currently they are requiring reservations to drive up the mountain. It is only $6 and it is more than worth it! The drive up the mountain is absolutely breathtaking with multiple pull offs to see some of the views. The views are not to be missed. Bring a camera and a jacket and enjoy. There is a gift shop at the summit with some souvenirs, inventory is limited and a mask is required for entry."
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,solid hike and workout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hike.  Definately Moderate to Difficult skill level.  Takes about 1:45 to get up and 1:!5 to go down.   It is definately physically taxing on the way up and there is also a lot of sun,  not very much shade.  The mountain and trail is one giant rock.   Going down takes some skill and we did suffer a minor sprain ankle in our party."
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,Hike to see the sunrise. Bring your headlamps!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I hiked this. DO IT! We are in our upper forties. The rest of the family drove up, but we took to the trail. Whoa! I have never hiked in the dark before, but it was awesome. We had just one flashlight, which made it a bit challenging. The moon was nearly full this July morning and illuminated parts of the path. We started hiking about 3:15 am for the 4:56am sunrise and JUST made it to the top as the sun peaked over the horizon. We did lose the path about 3/4 of the way up and ended up on the road… so we had to backtrack and that added about a half mile onto our journey. For about 45 minutes before the sun rose the skies began to show first lights. Many times we could have just stopped hiking and perched on a rock to watch, but we felt compelled to reach the summit. I recommend a water bottle and a granola bar at minimum. Luckily the store at the top was open at that early hour and had Apple pay so we could buy energy bars; we forgot a snack and were famished! It was harder to descend than we expected, and we were amazed at what we’d done in the dark once we could see the terrain."
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,Fantastic Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I completed this hike over the weekend and really enjoyed it. You can either start the ike from the top and park in the parking lot, or, you can park on the side of the road just outside the blackbear camp ground (I used that for my GPS) and walk up the trail from the forest entrance. We chose the start at the bottom which I'm very happy about."
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,"Despite Crowds and parking lot at the summit, Cadillac Mountain hike is a must.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Finally hiked Cadillac after having driven up 25 years ago.  It was a warm day and we were exposed to the sun most of the way up.  I enjoyed the hike,  but Gorham is actually my favorite at  Acadia.  We had hiked Gorham that morning.  The views are stunning.  Our small dog hiked up with us but needed to be carried down as his paws became raw from the rocks.  The hike is not difficult just long and steep.  We stayed briefly at the top to eat but the parking lot and the tourist just annoyed me and took away from the climb.  There is no traditional  summit marker so if that is your thing make sure that you visit the real geological marker (behind the gift shop, up the hill and to the right in the ground)"
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,Worth the extra reservation!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"First of all, we appreciated the accommodating service.  I made the initial mistake of reserving for a Friday when in reality we were there on a Thursday.  All I had to do was go back on the web site and make the change for no added fee.  It would have been worth it even if I had to pay again.  Beautiful drive!"
Cadillac Mountain North Ridge Trail,5.0,Shuttle service,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are two senior citizens, with balance issues.  We were intimidated by the reservation procedure, but we saw a newspaper article about a shuttle van that you could get in Bar Harbor.   This proved to be our best access to the mountain, as we only wanted to see the view and spend a little time up there.   We are not hikers or bikers!   We are so glad that we called Ellen and went up in her Mercedes van that she named Bessie!  Check it out!  She just started this business 16 days ago!  It’s called Cadillac Mountain Summit Shuttle!   So glad we did not miss this opportunity to visit the jewel of Acadia National Park!!!  Thanks, Ellen"
Panorama Trail,5.0,Wow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was lucky enough to do this trail as Storm Hilary just passed through. It meant I didn't get the regular August blue skies, but what I saw was arguably more special. For instance I stood on Panorama Point, alone, looking down on a rainbow that arched across the valley in front of Half Dome. The waterfalls had all been boosted by rain from the storm. Cloud and mist generally added to the atmosphere and photos, even if I did sometimes have to wait a little for it to sufficiently clear."
Panorama Trail,5.0,Go from Glacier Point to Nevada Falls instead of the reverse,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have done this trail now twice, going once in each direction. While it is a fine trail, the route heading from Glacier Point to Nevada Falls definitely has the better views (and has the advantage of being net downward, though with some climbs after Illilouette Fall). Mostly this is a way to connect from Nevada Falls to Glacier Point, with a nice stop at the Illilouette for a snack."
Panorama Trail,5.0,A rugged but beautiful trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Panorama Trail is an 8.5 mile/13.5 km trail (one way) in Yosemite National Park that stretches between Glacier Point and Yosemite Valley.  Whether you go up from Yosemite Valley or come down from Glacier Point, the hike is rated “strenuous” as there is a total elevation change of 3,200 feet (975 meters).  When I first started researching this hike one of my first thoughts was “How can a hike that is primarily downhill be rated strenuous?”  Now I know."
Panorama Trail,5.0,Panorama Trail - an amazing hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Panorama Trail is an amazing 8.5 mile one-way hike that offers a feast for the eyes -- sweeping vistas of Yosemite Valley, up-close encounters with three big waterfalls, views from around the backside of Half Dome that also take in North Dome, Liberty Cap, Mt. Hoffmann, the Clark Range, and much more."
Panorama Trail,5.0,"An Incredible Hike, But Take The John Muir Trail to the Bottom",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I hiked this trail at the end of June, and it was a fantastic experience.  Since we had limited time, we opted not to hike up to Glacier Point, but take the bus instead.  (Plus, ascending 3,000 feet in 4 miles does not sound all that fun.)  The buses up to Glacier Point leave from the lodge at 8:30, 10:00, and 1:30. I recommend reserving your tickets in advance, if possible. Once at the top, you can use the restroom and load up on pre-hike calories at the cafe."
Panorama Trail,5.0,A Tale of Two Trails….,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I visited Glacier Point twice during our tour through Yosemite in late June 2012.  Our first time was on our transition day from Wawona to the Valley when we drove to Glacier Point just to check out the views, which were spectacular.  We worked our way along each of the vantage points, including the Geology Hut, just taking in the views and trying to capture as least some sense of the grand vistas with our cameras.  We also did a little reconnoitering for the hike that we had planned for the next day which would start at Glacier Point and end back in the Valley.  We spent about an hour enjoying the views and investigating the area.  It is a hopping place, between the folks who drive themselves and all buses bringing tourists and hikers to the area.  As for drive time, it took us an hour to drive up from Wawona and about the same to get down to the Lodge at the Falls (perhaps a little be longer; hard to tell as we made a few stops along the way)."
Panorama Trail,5.0,Just a walk in the park .......,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of the schedule hikes we were looking forward to on our visit to Yosemite National Park, and had therefore pre-booked a seat on the shuttle bus that takes you from the valley floor to Glacier Point. If you’re planning on doing this hike, then booking the shuttle bus is a must as seating is limited and sells out quickly. Having taken the shuttle bus to Glacier Point we gazed on the impressive views of Half Dome etc before setting off on the trail. This trail, as the name suggests, takes you on a meandering hike from Glacier Point to the valley floor. This is approx. 9 miles in length and can be hard going in several places as this is not a downhill wander. From Glacier Point the trail heads off on a slow downhill direction and is very enjoyable as you gaze upon the valley and the waterfalls as you descend. After a mile or so you find yourself at the first low point as you cross the bridge just above Silhouette Falls and begin the slow, switchback filled ascent up the other side of the valley. After you’ve made some progress on this ascent, keep your eyes open for a narrow ‘trail’ off to the left as you turn right on yet another switchback. I’m sorry I couldn’t be more precise in my pinpointing of this trail, but as you wander through the bushes on this level section you come across what can only be described as an ‘awesomely spectacular’ view point. This point looks out over the valley below with an almost vertical drop so please be very careful and stay away from the edge !!"
Panorama Trail,5.0,12 things you must know about the Panorama Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"1. This hike has been called by many as the most beautiful hike in Yosemite.  Ok, if not many people, at least me, who has done almost all the hikes in this park, except Half Dome.  "
Panorama Trail,5.0,One of the BEST Hiking Trails in California!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If there is one-full day to be spent doing something amazing in Yosemite Valley, then get packing to go on the most beautiful and diverse hike with some of the breathtaking views you’ll ever get to see in one of the best trails in Yosemite. On our family’s first trip to Yosemite last summer, we decided to do the Panorama Trail the morning after we arrived for our 2-night stay at Yosemite Valley Lodge.   "
Panorama Trail,5.0,Panorama and Four Mile Trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'm almost a year late in getting around to this, as we visited Yosemite in late May and early June, 2015. Our morning started at dawn at the Four Mile trailhead on the valley floor. FYI, Four Mile Trail is actually closer to five miles. The 3,200 foot climb is unrelenting, so if you're not in decent shape, don't do this hike! Along the way, you will get some great shots of Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls, the Valley, Half Dome and El Capitan. We arrived at Glacier Point, where we refueled, had a bathroom break and took in the incredible views. The vast majority of tourists either drive or take a bus to GP so there is a lot of activity there. Anxious to get away from all that and find more solitude, we began our descent down the 8.5 mile Panorama Trail. This hike was our substitute for hiking Half Dome, as we were unsuccessful in obtaining permits for any of the four days we were there. This is a stunningly beautiful trail. It is almost entirely downhill, and the footing is decent for the most part. You will have incredible views all along the way. On the way, look closely for an unmarked spot on your left called Panorama Point shortly after you cross over Illilouette Falls. This is definitely worth the 100 yard side trip, but can be tough to spot.  You will eventually intersect with the Mist Trail and Half Dome trail at the top of Nevada Fall. This is where we discovered from fellow hikers returning from Half Dome that there were no rangers checking permits that day. Oh well!! Take off your shoes and ice down your feet and knees in the water at the top of the fall! You still have to descend over three miles down either the Mist Trail or John Muir trail. Take the Mist Trail if your knees, feet and ankles are still hanging in there. Nevada Fall will be on your left and Vernal Fall will be on the right during this final stage of the hike. The footing can be slick so having the right footwear will surely help. Once you arrive in Curry Village, you are still about three miles from your car. Either hike it or catch the shuttle back to get you much closer. This is an absolutely incredible day hike that will not disappoint, but make sure you are fit enough to even attempt this. This is a hike you will never forget!"
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Must do when in Ouray,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took advantage of the great fall weather to try this hike. There were parts where the rating of moderate was underestimated, but overall it wasn’t too bad. Falls were underwhelming due to drought but the aspens made up for it. My favorite part was the Potato Patch. Great spot for a break. We took the Ice Park cutoff, but did the metal bridge and tunnel above the Box Canyon. Highly recommended this hike."
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Must do walk with great views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved the entire trail, you can go in either direction it doesn't really matter as long as you leave early (think midday or later summer rain storms!). The views are great, as well as the history you walk past. Bring plenty of water and snacks, as you can spend much longer on the trail if weather permits (though popping into town is always an option)."
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Great Views Close to Town,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Accessible from many parts of town you can choose to either do the whole trail or parts of it.  Looking down on the town or up into the mountains the views are all tremendous.
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Amazing views on this challenging hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We explored part of this trail around Box Canyon, then after lunch in town, we started again at Cascade Falls and followed to the edge of town near the Hot Springs. This proved amazing views of Ouray and enough challenge for my 3 teenage boys while still being doable for me & my husband. Would highly recommend!"
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Harder than listed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are well versed in hiking and although not used to the altitude, this hike is harder than rated. It encircles the town of Ouray. We started it at Box Canyon Falls, took a shortcut across the highway in order to eliminate the ice park area, and then went through Baby Bathtubs and ultimately Cascade Falls where we had parked a car. This took us 5 hours with lots of photo breaks and someone with bad knees. The Fall colors were great."
Perimeter Trail,4.5,We are not hikers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So we are not hikers as a general rule.  We live in the city.  But when we have an opportunity, we try to take advantage of easy to moderate hikes.  Perimeter Trail is not easy.  It begins across from the Ouray Visitors' Center on the east side of US 550.  I'm 52 and in good shape; my son is 17 and NEVER afraid of heights; My hubby is 70 and in generally good health.  I was mistaken in my research.  I thought the trail to Cascade Falls was a 1/4 mile general straight line.  NO.  We are in the Rockies, and I should have known in the first 5 minutes that my husband might not be able to make it up.  He persevered.   Steep, with dropoffs, and ends up at Cascade Falls, which is beautiful.  I would call it a moderate plus hike as some places were very steep and rocky, but well worth it￼.  The entire loop is 5 miles, but we just hiked the first mile until we saw Cascade Falls.  We left the trail and walked down 8th street into town and had a big lunch.  Great morning!!"
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Great trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiked this one early one morning. Not very busy while we were on the trail. We did the whole trail in about 3 1/4 hours and that was with stopping to take photos and chat with a few fellow hikers. Great views of waterfalls, canyons and the town. "
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Don't underestimate this trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did the Perimeter Trail several years ago before it was complete and always wanted to return to walk the whole trail. Unfortunately the weather wasn't kind to us for our stay in Ouray and it rained for part of the walk (although, fortunately the forecast thunder didn't materialise) but we managed to walk the whole trail, starting from opposite the visitor centre. As others have said, this is quite a strenuous trail with a steep climb at the beginning and the section we hadn't done before was more demanding than we expected. It is definitely not for those who want an easy stroll but, if you are a competent hiker, it is a very good hike."
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Unique Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We only hiked a few small sections of the Perimeter Trail but we would like to do the whole thing next time we are here. It is a very unique trail and you get to hit all the highlights of Ouray. Baby Bathtubs very enjoyable, family friendly."
Perimeter Trail,4.5,Holiday trail,3.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail seemed longer than it was. Go counter clockwise or plan on climbing more often. There are some scary places with loose rock if someone isn’t used to hiking. We enjoyed the waterfall and baby baths. It got too hot and I ended up walking down the road to town and the others came back hours later with a large climb out. They were exhausted! Pretty views.
Fat Man's Misery,4.5,"Narrow, windy & low passageway",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed the History of Mammoth Cave Your when half way through we got to the Fat Man’s Misery.

Fat Man's Misery,4.5,Suck it in!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fat Man's Misery is a part of the Historic tour (maybe others) in Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky. It's a tight squeeze for some folks. I got thru with just a minor inconvenience. I'm 275 and about 5'6"". Just a bit of a hassle 1 or 2 times. It's a touristy-kind of tour, not strenuous, there were 4 and 5 year old kids in this trip. Mammoth Cave is a great place to visit in the summer time, because about 200 feet from the cave entrance, Nature's A/C kicks on. There is about a 60F wind blowing out of the cave, which feels great going in, the humidity and temp is low, but coming back out, you have to face reality! The hill climb back to the visitors center is a little steep, as well, know and respect your physical limitations before you think about this tour."
Fat Man's Misery,4.5,You can do it. (With a small warning),5.0 of 5 bubbles,I think that the only reason why they even mention Fat Man's and Tall Man's Misery before the tour is if you are not able to bend and weave through that portion.  I am a big gal (size 4X) with back problems and I did just fine.  It was actually a lot of fun and gave me a chance to feel like a little kid again.  If you are a larger person you know that you have to fit through tight spaces all the time so this is nothing new.  It is a beautiful cave and well worth that small portion of uncomfort.  If you are claustrophobic - forget about it!  Go on Frozen Niagra.  Once you are down in the cave it may be hours before you can get out if you have a panic attack and cannot go further.
Fat Man's Misery,4.5,No worries! Even for larger sizes! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ok, so I want to start this by saying that I alllllmost didn’t go on the Historic tour just because I feared that I wouldn’t fit through this. And the reviews I read gave me mixed feelings. So, to hopefully help someone like me out, I want to be clear. It was NO big deal. I wear size 20W or XXL bottoms and was fine! Yes, I had to “squeeze,” a bit so did everyone. I was surprised by how much room I really had! People larger than me could’ve easily fit. You’re following a path that is narrow at the bottom, but open above the waist. My kids loved it, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had maneuvering through it! Fat Man’s Misery was not miserable in the least! So much fun!"

Sure I had to turn sideways and duck but the ""squeeze"" did not force me to touch the walls. Close but not tight. No worries. The stones are damp and worn smooth from the thousands of visitors rubbing their hands on the sides as they walk through. The space is narrow to about hip height and larger above the waist with side head and shoulder room. Thus the feeling of a tall narrow squeeze and claustrophobic tightness does not happen. "

Silver Comet Trail,4.5,Great paved bike/run path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an excellent place to get out and ride, run, or walk. It’s paved and pretty flat. Use to be an old train track. Park over by Nickijak Elementary School in Smyrna. Shady and pretty nice path. "
Silver Comet Trail,4.5,Took the trail to the covered bridge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since my husband and I like covered bridges and I found out you could take the trail to get to it, we were on it! But there are no signs. We were fortunate enough to run into another couple that told us were it was. So for those that would like the directions - see my photos 😊 "
Silver Comet Trail,4.5,DANGEROUS place to visit,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"When we went there we had to deal with loose pitbulls on the trail that were chasing us! My calf muscles got a hell of a work out. I am very glad my kids were not along for the visit as they wouldn't of been able to out peddle those dogs, and the results could of been horrific.  A call to the local authorities was brushed off. Life-changing pitbull attacks are happening almost daily in Georgia now, so we will be taking this trail off our list of places to go. I hope they do something to restore safety to this state. Too many horrific maulings for the ride to be pleasant anymore especially when loose dogs are on the trail."

Silver Comet Trail,4.5,"Silver Comet: Full Trail on a Bicycle, Review",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I just completed a one day cycling trip on the trail between mile marker 0 in Smyrna and the end of the trail on the GA/AL state border (approx. 62.5 miles). Considering the weather, there were not many people on the trail beyond the first few Cobb county trailheads where I saw runners and joggers. The trail in Cobb county was pristine, clearly marked, and it looked very well maintained. You do cross multiple surface streets, which require stopping. There are multiple trailheads that have restroom and parking facilities on the way. After you enter Paulding county, you are basically leaving suburban Atlanta, and you see less people and more forest and farms. The Paulding county sheriff patrols the route with small motorized vehicles and I saw at least 3 of them on different sections of the trail. "

As I refer to TripAdvisor for many of our trips, I decided to share our experience so others would have some knowledge as to what to expect.  We had a great time and will definitely try this again.

Silver Comet Trail,4.5,Rode it Round Trip!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rode the Silver Comet and Chief Ladiga trails over Memorial Day weekend and had the trip over 4 days. We packed water, snacks (larabars, nuts, bananas), clothes and toiletries in commuter bags on our bike posts. On the way we saw mountains, creeks/rivers, bridges, tunnels, farms, various animals (turkeys, rabbits, etc), and more. Our trip took lots of planning so maybe someone else will benefit from our itinerary: "
Silver Comet Trail,4.5,Great Bicycle Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Silver Comet Trail is 61.5 miles long and officially starts at Mavell Road in Smyrna, GA.  You can add another 5 miles or so by starting your journey at Silver Comet Trail Cumberland Connector behind Cumberland Mall.  The trail extends all the way to Georgia/Alabama State line where it connects with the 33-mile long Chief Ladiga Trail.  Cumberland Connector, Silver Comet and Chief Ladiga Trails combined, you have roughly 100 miles of continuous paved trail, which I understand is the second longest in the US."
Silver Comet Trail,4.5,"Awesome trail to skate, bike, or walk a dog",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It takes a drive from Atlanta to get here, but it's worth it.  This is hands down the best place to in-line skate in the Atlanta area.  Most of the area around here is hilly so it's nice that there is a trail that's mostly flat.  The scenery is beautiful because most of the trail is elevated so you get to look down onto roads and gullys.  I saw regular patrols by the park attendants.  It's a very busy trail mostly full of cyclists, but I saw several groups walking their dogs, jogging, and skating.  Some of the houses you past are huge mansions so you get to see some nice landscaping.  There is a public restroom available near the parking lot.  The only problem you might have is that the parking lot gets full quickly.  So get here early.  In my humble opinion this rails-to-trails is one of the best ones out there."
George S. Mickelson Trail,5.0,Great ride!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Mickelson Trail is AMAZING!  We found a shuttle to take us from Deadwood to Hill City, and then rode back to Deadwood (~50 miles).  Riding through the tunnels, along the creek pastures, and through beautiful woods made the entire 50 miles worth every minute.  We had e-bikes which helped all of our group finish the trip with little to no difficulties. This route has some steady uphill climbs, but the downhill side provides some respite.  Take a lunch and plenty of water along with layers to make the most of your day.  There are very few spots where you can get off the path to enjoy lunch or get out of the weather.  Prepare accordingly.  "
George S. Mickelson Trail,5.0,The perfect hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I started at the Sugarloaf Trailhead in Lead, hiking south for an hour before we turned around. The trail is perfect. No obstacles, just beautiful views. The fall leaves were stunning. Only saw a handful of other hikers/cyclists. There’s a $4/day/person trail fee. There are forms to fill out and leave with your $4 in a slot at the trailhead."
George S. Mickelson Trail,5.0,Phenomenal bike ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Surprisingly this may have been my favorite part of our trip to see Mt. Rushmore.  This is one of the most scenic and well maintained trails I have ever been on.  We rode our bikes from Rockford towards Custer.  We went about 20 miles.  The main thing that I wanted to see were the tunnels which were amazing.  This is trail that most anyone can and should do.  Nowadays with the popularity of E-bikes it is even easier.  I would just like to thank the state of South Dakota for making this trail available to the public.    If i am back in this area again this trail will definitely be on my to do list.  Highly, highly recommend as a way to get out and enjoy nature.  A Fantastic family event."

George S. Mickelson Trail,5.0,One of my favorite trails ever!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice gravel trail with amazing views. We started at the Rochford trailhead and went south, a little past the two tunnels that are just south of the Mistic trailhead. The scenery was truly incredible and the tunnels were pretty cool. Beware that while it’s only a slight (the trail maps say no more than 4%) grade, it’s almost all downhill when you head south, so when you head back, it’s almost all uphill. It was a great workout with some great views."

I love active adventures. When I saw the Mickelson Trail Trip it looked perfect! Hiking and biking with some of our nation’s history, it was a win win! Our guides Todd, Anna and Evan were excellent! Thoughtful, courteous, attentive, knowledgeable and entertaining! I highly recommend Bicycle Adventures for First Class Tour and Customer Service! "
George S. Mickelson Trail,5.0,Wonderful ride!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Shuttled up to mystic trailhead and rode to Hill City. It was a great time.  Total length of ride was 14.6 miles and that was just eight for my crew.  In fact, 6.9 miles of that were up hill. That part was tough but worth it.  There were several tunnels that looked super old but so well built.  We saw beautiful streams and enjoyed nature.  My only advice is bring plenty of water, know your limitations, and take your time.  Enjoy!"
George S. Mickelson Trail,5.0,Beautiful Well Maintained Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rode from Deadwood to almost DuPont.  Uphill most of the way out, but a speedy glide back.   Beautiful black Hills scenery.   Another day rode from Mytic to tunnel 8, which was also uphill out, but a much more manageable grade.   Highly recommend this trail, but watch out for free range cattle!"

Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Great trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great trail for all ages and abilities. My 4 and 6 year olds loved running through the trails and exploring the redwoods along the trail. There’s a small parking lot but people are constantly coming and going so just wait a bit and you’ll snag a spot. There’s two out houses for use.
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Must do in Red Woods.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lady Bird Johnson is a great grove of trees with an easy to walk path anyone can do.  Just remember get here early because the parking lot is very small and you will be waiting for a long time just to get a parking spot.   The trail goes across the road via. a bridge and then wanders through the grove.  there are signs that talk about why it was named after Lady Bird Johnson that are interesting.  Definitely a must stop when in the park
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,"Nothing special, you see the same all over the park",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Other than the fact that rangers can be found here to share information and answer questions, and there is a parking lot, I don't know why this is listed as a highlight of the  park, so this is where big groups and tour buses unload the crowds.  You see large trees on every trail, many of which are not as noisy or crowded.  Skip it and be more selective (Nickerson Ranch, Trillium Falls, Hidden Beach, Enders Beach).  A mistake to avoid - I connected to the Lady Bird from the Berry Glen trail (which connects from three miles downhill).  Avoid Berry Glen, there is nothing unusual to see, unless you are looking for a strenuous workout."
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Just a Really Lovely Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a wonderfully accessible trail for all abilities that takes you through a gorgeous grove of giant redwoods.  If it has rained at all before or during your visit the trail will be muddy, so plan accordingly.  The redwoods are the stars of the show here, but there are many other beautiful flowering plants to enjoy here as well."
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Nice trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a 1.4-mile hike around the redwoods. It is beautiful and peaceful. Unfortunately, the trail maps were out by the time we started off, which did deprive us of the information from the numbered signs on the trail. We waked several trails today, so this one was hard for me."
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Get there early for a peaceful hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Signage from Hwy 101 is good. You drive down Bald Hills Road & this trail is signed as well. The parking lot is large. There's pit toilets. Information boards in the parking lot & along the trail.  1.3 mile loop, rated easy. We were here on a Monday morning."
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Easy and enjoyable,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy hike through the grove.  A March trip found a fair amount of snow and a quiet visit in the morning.  At most you’d only want a bottle of water for this trek.  Easy parking off the road and has a pit toilet near the parking lot.  Kids, seniors - all can do this hike."
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Not in my top 3 of the Groves we saw.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the first grove we walked in our stay at Redwoods, and I would say it was probably my least favorite at the end of the day.  And, I don't say that to say that it was bad or anything, I just think the other groves we walked (Stout Grove, Grove of the Titans, Big Tree Trail)."
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Very pretty walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I never realized how tall the redwwods until I walked in this park. The trail meanders through the forest and at one point hugs the side of an elevation. Trees at the bottom of the hill went so high as to be as tall as the trees on the side of the hill. Just incredibly tall! The place is really peaceful and very much enjoyable, beautiful"
Lady Bird Johnson Grove,5.0,Quick 45 minute loop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Some awesome sights of redwoods that survived fires and wind damage. Some you can stand inside of and walk through. The trail was fairly easy with little drop or climb in elevation.  Road going up is a bit sketchy with many switchbacks and broken and sucken pavement most of the way.  It was misty and had just rained a little prior to our arrival.
Taggart Lake,5.0,Enjoyed the 4 mile hike with beautiful views of Taggart Lake,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We flew into JAC Jackson airport on a Saturday (8/29).  We landed at noon and by 1:30 pm, we were parked in the Taggart Lake trailhead parking lot and started our hike."
Taggart Lake,5.0,Get here EARLY!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got there at 7:30 AM and there was plenty of parking, but when we got out, cars were parked for miles down the road. We were told parking is completely full by 9AM. We did Taggart lake trail and Bradley Lake loop trail as a combined full day hike of 6 miles. Some spots are very flat and some have a lot of elevation. Watch out for some tree roots and rocks to sneak up on you, here and there. I would call this a moderate hike. We had a party of 6 people from ages 12 to 65 and it was enjoyed by all."
Taggart Lake,5.0,I Made It!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had been told by a couple during our sleigh ride that this was a fun hike. It is the first week of March. There is still a lot of snow and the lake is frozen over but we still wanted to check it out. We arrive at the parking area full of skiers and hikers with mini snow shoes (more of description, not the actual product title). We had neither but decided to hike anyway. My wife and adult daughter are in extremely good shape. I, on the other hand, am very much out of shape. That said, I made it from start to finish. Yes, I was huffing and puffing air. Yes, I was sweating profusely in the 20 degree weather but, I made it. The views and scenery were awesome. There were some inconsiderate skiers that wizzed by in excess of 30 MPH without warning but that was the most dangerous part of the trip. I arrived at the parking lot glad to have made the journey!"
Taggart Lake,5.0,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a very easy flat walk. We started very early in the morning and were one of the first hikers on the trail. We saw a deer on the way in and the lake was well worth the hike. If you take a left at the lake there is a really nice bridge to take pictures from. We saw a beaver and some incredible birds at the lake. My wife and I are in good shape and we were in and out in a very short time.
Taggart Lake,5.0,Great mid-range hike with beautiful views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A window of decent hiking weather opened for us after the Jenny Lake ferry had stopped & we decided the hike to Taggert Lake would let us get out & get back before dark. It was perfect! We combined it with the Bradley Lake loop to make about a 5 mile event. Views of the Tetons and both lakes were stunning.  We were there in mid-May so there was still snow in some areas and emerging wild flowers in others. Didn't need sticks or foot cleats but definitely had some elevation to conquer. And yes, we went from foggy drizzle to rain, to sleet and snow, to sun and back to thunder storms while we were out-full weather credit. Glad we went!"
Taggart Lake,5.0,Amazing Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were only at Grand Teton for one day, but the hike to Taggert Lake was my favorite part.  The hike isn’t too bad.  There is a direct route that goes to the right that is only 1.6 miles and that takes you directly to the lake.  The Taggert Lake trail is to the left and it is 2.4 miles.  Either way the reward when you get there is more than worth it.  Probably one of the most beautiful and serene hiking experiences of my life. "
Taggart Lake,5.0,Do this hike if you want to feel like you're a million miles away!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's not a difficult hike and is right off the parking lot.  Get there early.  We got there at 9:30am and snagged the last spot.  Per other's suggestions, we went counter-clockwise on the trail (to the right).  It's supposed to be 4.5 mile hike if you do the full loop.  But our teens wanted to go back the way we came for a total of 3.5 miles.  The path has a lot of scenic stops and great opportunity for photos.  You pass by small waterfall, creeks, beautiful mountain vistas, and even a mule stable.  When you reach the lake, you can find a hidden little area to sit on some boulders and enjoy the peaceful and beautiful view.  We even dipped our feet and cooled off.  It get's hot fast (upper 80's), which feels like 90s in high elevation.  We had a small picnic by the lake and took our time to trek back to the parking lot.  Don't miss this!"
Taggart Lake,5.0,Best bang for the hiking effort,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A hike for the whole family -- pretty easy walk to a gorgeous alpine lake in the Tetons.  Tip: the crowds gather at the small bit of lake trail between the wooden bridge and the parking lot trail up.  Follow trail to Bradley Lake (from Taggart Lake) and in five minutes the Taggart shoreline is quiet and almost empty. 
Taggart Lake,5.0,. Lovely and overcrowded,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The lake itself gets five stars. The wildlife around it get five stars. Any LiveHealthy tree during climate change gets five stars. The trail is well maintained. Wildflowers in late spring. It is so crowded. The parking lot is overcrowded, the roads on both sides near the parking lot is overcrowded, the trail head is overcrowded, and the trail itself is overcrowded. A bit like my remembrance of Disney land. You can take the long way to the lake which is less crowded but once you get near the lake there are too many people there to fully enjoy nature ."
Taggart Lake,5.0,Crystal clear lake,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hike to Taggart Lake was the first hike we did in the Tetons. My parents had just flown in from sea level the day before we hiked. Also our kids were 5 and 11, so we needed an easier hike in order to include everyone. Even though it was not hard, this hike was amazingly beautiful! It is a 3.3 mile hike with only 300 feet of elevation gain and a trail difficulty of ""easy"". The water is crystal clear in the lake and is well worth the trip!"
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,"Breathtaking views, steep hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Without a doubt, this is a shorter ""must do"" hike if you are in the area.  The drive up to the trailhead is an adventure as you pass thru LOW and NARROW tunnels along the Needles highway.  You must pay $20 at a staffed checkpoint to access the highway and then drive to the trailhead. "
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,Very Enjoyable Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a great hike that took us less than 2 hours to do.    The Cathedral Spires rock formation was just beautiful  We spent a good amount of time taking photos & watching a mountain goat with her babies.   The goats were up on a grassy ledge & were somewhat visible without binoculars.   Other hikers who had binoculars were very generous is sharing them so we could  get a better look.    The trail was well marked.    FYI - the parking lot is not very big.   Maybe has 20 spaces. We got there about 9 am & pulled right into an empty space.
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,One of the best hikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of our two favorite hikes at Custer State Park, along with the hike up to Black Elk Peak. It’s about 1.9 miles out and back with 488 feet of elevation gain. It’s really not that difficult of a hike; there are a few places where you do have to climb up some rocks in the trail, but there are plenty of footholds and it’s almost like climbing stairs. The trail itself is beautiful and lush, with a little bit of fall color starting at this time of year, and of course the spires around you. "
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,One of the Must Do Hikes in Custer State Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a great hike which takes you right up to the base of Cathedral Spires (you can actually go inside the spires which was thrilling). Moderately strenuous, 3 mile round trip hike and included scrambling up rocks at one point. Took me about 2 hours but this left time to sit and relax when I reached the turn around point on the trail. Parking is limited but I had no problem in the middle of the day on a weekday in late August. Many people parking in the area aren't hiking but taking photos of the spires so be patient and a spot may open up after not too long."
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,Cathedral Spires mixed with Little Devils tower was the highlight of our trip! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Cathedral Spires trail meets up with a trial that will bring you closer to the top of Little Devils Tower. This was the highlight of our trip. We did the whole Cathedral hike that brings you through crevasses in rock walls and into the spires, had a snake slither across my feet, and then on the way back there is a trail leading to Little Devils Tower trail. On that trail, we had two different times where bucks jumped out right in front of us, only 6 feet away. There are stunning views at the top of Little Devils Tower, bit if you want to go to the top, dogs can't make it and you do need to scamper up the side of rock mountain. Our 10 year old had no trouble making the hike up, but some people were giving up before they made it to the top. "
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,A park highlight,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Any reasonably fit person will manage this trail. And by reasonably fit I only mean someone who can climb a few flights of stair without getting winded.   There is a fair amount of elevation gain, but the quality of the trail is high, the distance modest.  There is no need for technical skills, but you should wear hiking shoes and if you are in marginally decent shape, a pair of hiking poles will help.  The views of the spires are great from the outset, so even if you find you can't negotiate the whole trail, do yourself a favor and walk as far as you can."
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,Beautiful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I clocked this hike at 2.84 miles, 638 ft elevation gain, and it took me 80 minutes. There are a lot of switchbacks, but just about the time you think you don't want to climb any higher, it levels off and you're at the end of the hike! Some pretty good sized ""steps"" up on rocks. If you're tipsy on your feet at all, or have cranky knees, think about bringing a hiking pole."
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,Not for the faint at heart! Really!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Went here early Thursday morning and it was a beautiful but strenuous hike. All the reviews and info on this hike say the same thing so mine isn’t very new. Younger kids and older folks may have a little trouble here due to elevation and size of boulders on the trail.  However when you make it to the valley at the top you are rewarded with unbelievable rock formations up close and personal.  We even saw a climber at the top of one of the spires!  Take some water and food because you are going to want to stay awhile.  Parking is limited so I recommend getting there as soon as you can. Enjoy!
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,A Must-Do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were simply driving the Needles highway and stopping at each overlook when we noticed, at one such overlook, a sign for the Cathedral Spires trail.   I grabbed my hiking stick and away we went.   I was delighted and felt thus is the best hike ever.  The views were fantastic, and even though it was advertised as strenuous, I thought there was just the perfect amount of climbing over rocks to make it fun.  I didn’t feel it was strenuous but people who don’t hike much might disagree.  It really is a must-do if you are at Custer State Park. There’s no place like Custer."
Cathedral Spires Hiking Trail,5.0,Beautiful hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Our family of five (6-54 yo) really enjoyed this hike. A steady climb leads to a flatter area surrounded by the spires. It was truly beautiful and the 6 year old had no trouble and didn’t complain. At the end of the hike we met two mountain goats- a mom and her baby - and enjoyed watching them for a while before heading back down.
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,"beautiful, well maintained trail",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"we got there early (8:30) and felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. trail is very well maintained, not sure you could make it nicer without losing the natural feel of the woods. mountain is very steep, but trail has many switchbacks to make it easier to traverse. a couple recent trees down over trail, but they were manageable. no markers, but trail is used enough that it is obvious. some additional signage would be nice as far as distance. trail was very busy when we got back to car at 12:30."
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,"Get here early, elevation gain 1800 feet",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Get here early. We were at the trailhead on a Monday at 6:30 am and there were already 4 cars in the parking lot, which services Grotto Falls trailhead and Rainbow Falls trailhead. When we got back at 10:15 even the overflow lot and road parking were full. My apple watch showed that I completed 78 flights of stairs on this hike and that was the first 2.5 miles. All down hill back to the car for 5.2 mile finish. Very nice hike with water flowing first part of trail then with elevation gain you get more stellar views through the tree line. Neat waterfall that you are able to walk behind if you are careful. Look for Salamanders. Take plenty of water and be prepared to take multiple breaks if you are not in shape for this elevation gain of 1800 feet."
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,Great hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice hike. It is not an easy hike but absolutely rewarding. For any hiking out in the Smokey Mountains always take water with abs be prepared. The falls were beautiful. Don’t stop at the first small fall you see, you must keep going to get to rainbow falls. Good early in the morning too, later in the day there are more people and not much parking. "
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,Go do it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I (both in mid-50’s) really enjoyed this hike.  It was our first one when we got to GSMNP 9-9-20.  We are both active and fit and enjoyed the challenge of elevation gain and time it took to complete.  Elevation gain was 1,685.  It is rated strenuous.  We spent little under 4 hours but that included eating lunch at the falls. Wear hiking shoes and make sure to take water and snacks. "
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful but strenuous hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is not for anyone who is not moderately in shape . The trail is rocky and has many tree roots, recommend hiking boots and lots of water .A lot of the trail is clay so slippery when wet, trail was pretty damp for us Aug 27 in 90 degree temps.To get to the falls it took us 2 hours up and 1.5 down. The hike up is all uphill about a 20% grade . People we saw commented it felt longer than 2.7 miles up. There is a Cool wooden log bridge- I’d say from there it’s about 30 minutes to rainbow falls -Will pass small waterfall after bridge and then 10 minutes later reach rainbow falls."
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,That log bridge  is a lawsuit  waiting to happen,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked the trail with my son. We waited for a thunderstorm to pass before we started it. The creek waters were fast and furious due to the rain. We made good progress, spotted a bear at one point, but it walked away from us. Then we got to the foot log that spans the creek. It’s a narrow surface to walk on, and there’s only one handrail, with about 6 uprights spaced wide apart. The uprights make it difficult, if not impossible, to choose straddling the log as a safer way to get across. Anyway, it’s not a surface you can afford to lose your balance on, especially on the side with no handrail! You fall in that creek, it’s game over. Like the NPS Hiking Safety guide says, when crossing streams safely, your best option may be turning back and that’s exactly what we did. Never got to see Rainbow Falls but I’m alive to write this and that sounds like a win to me!"
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,"Shady, Rocky, and Kind of Miserable",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"When I read this trail was “rocky”, I thought, “Ok, I don’t mind climbing.” No. No. No. This is a trail covered with nothing but loose rocks. Not pebbles, but foot size rocks on top of other foot sized rocks. This is like walking on legos, uphill, with vegetation smacking you in the face regularly.  Very few openings with great views. "
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,3.2 mile hike. ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The markers said 2.5 miles, but my AllTrails app said 3.2 when we got to the top. Took 2 hours to top with children ages 9&11 and several adults. We did a fairly slow pace on way up and made it down in 1:15. Everything still brown at this time of year and trail was crowded with people. "
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,A very rewarding hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I am very glad i put this trail on our itinerary!
Rainbow Falls Trail,4.5,Be ready for uphill,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hike is ALL uphill, the elevation gain is significant. That said, take your time and enjoy the mountains, there is plenty of water if you have a filter or you can carry a couple bottles. I carried 3 16oz bottles along with a few trail bars. I was planning to photograph along the way so I took a little longer to hike up.  The trail was very busy so I did't see any wildlife but the falls were great!"
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,Always Gorgeous!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We go through this area often, and often stop quick to get some fresh air and walk high enough on the trail to see that canyon with the water flowing through. No matter what time of year, it's always photo-beautiful and a great place to get pics of the kids or with the family. An easy walk to get to some beautiful photo spots, and of course if you want to keep going, you'll get to Avalanche Lake in about an hour."
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,Good option on a hot day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Avalanche Lake via Trail of the Cedars is a great trail for a hike and swim. The lake is gorgeous and cool (but not iceberg-frigid).  The entire trail is in the woods (not exposed) and shaded so is a good option for a hot day.
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,As advertised!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A gentle,  basically level wooded circuit through the trees.  Beautiful despite the smoky haze.  Pretty doable for the elderly or overweight, and we tacked it on to the Avalanche Lake trail for a net 5 miler.   Tip: even if you don’t think you want to tackle the whole Avalanche Lake Trail, try the first few hundred yards of it that include a little steep climbing.  You will be rewarded by beautiful views of a rushing, narrow, foamy  stream-carved watercourse through the rocks.  "
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,A nice way to end the day after hiking to Avalanche Lake,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We added this stroll after hiking to Avalanche Lake, and it seemed to be a nice way to cap off our time in the area.  Trail of the Cedars can be enjoyed by nearly everybody on this ADA accessible path. Placards along the walk point out information about the trees and nature in the area.  Parking can be a bit of an issue, so the earlier you arrive, the better your chance of not having to struggle to find parking."
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,Absolutely worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes, it is crowded, and yes, parking is a pain here, but this trail is not to be missed when you are at GNP. The paths and boardwalks are wide, so there is still plenty of room, even with lots of people. It is simply beautiful. If you love forests, go. Note that there are several entrances and several small parking lots for this trail. Partway around this trail is the start of the Avalanche Lake trail."
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,nice and easy walk in the forest,4.0 of 5 bubbles,a gentle walk on the boardwalk and compacted soil path amongst the trees.  It was a bit busy since this was as far as everyone could get on the going to the sun road on June 24 as the rest of the road was still closed while the park was putting up the guard rails along the road.  Parking was almost impossible to find. Bathrooms are located in the beginning of the trail.
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,"Having a bad hip & back, this walk was harder for me than before those injuries.  So it was a slog for me...where it h",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the Trail in a Clockwise Direction.  The Boardwalk was nice & the forest floor was well lit up in the late afternoon.  *Having a bad hip & back, this walk was harder for me than before those injuries occured.  So it was a slog for me...where it had not been before.  Even though it is rated as handicapped accessible...I give it a 3 rating."
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,Wonderful Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trails are very well kept and they have added elevated wooden walkways in rougher areas to accommodate wheel chairs, the walk itself is relatively flat and ideal for old and young alike. Some of the size and age of the trees are amazing. Several creeks dissect the trail and gaps in the trees provide beautiful views of the mountains that surround you."
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,Easy Short Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easiest hike in the park! It's sometimes hard to find parking between 7am and 4pm here, but this is a great little hike. It's mostly flat and mostly on a boardwalk through the woods. It is heavily trafficked with people. No wildlife to be seen here other than chipmunks and squirrels during our walk.  This trail also connects to the beginning of the Avalanche Lake hike, which is a must more strenuous and lengthy hike."
Trail of the Cedars,4.5,Very easy and VERY beautiful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"SUPER EASY walk, a toddler can do it.  Parking on the other hand.....that will take quite some time to find and]y available parking.  You just have to wait to get lucky I suppose.  Well worth it, this is a must hit spot in Glacier."
Lake Trail,4.5,Enjoy the Sights,3.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I are regular trail riders and have put about one thousand miles on our bikes each of the past two years.  We came to the WPB area to stay  at Singer Island for six nights.  While we were in the area we decided to ride the Lake Trail and found it to be a very nice ride despite the high winds.  Along the way you can see numerous beautiful homes.  A portion of the ride provides a great views of the water and the various yachts and ships.  The landscape and plants are also a great attraction of this ride.  
Lake Trail,4.5,Great Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fantastic trail on the water that runs from behind the Society of the Four Arts/Royal Palm Bridge all the way to the north tip of Palm Beach island.   Fabulous and relaxing place to walk, jog or bike.   Enjoy the architecture of the homes along the way and learn about many historic buildings on island such as the Duck's Nest Home and the original Bethesda-by-the-Sea church that at the time was only accessible via water."
Lake Trail,4.5,Great for Scenic Strolls,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Water on one side, along with the anchored yachts, and very extravagant mansions on the other side of the trail. Trail can be quite busy at times with bike, walkers, runners, and in line skaters. Still, it is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Highly recommend."
Lake Trail,4.5,Lake Trail Review,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Lake Trail is a great way to get a ""behind the scenes"" look at the Island and the beautiful homes. The Trail is for leisurely riders / joggers & walkers. It is not marked well or continuous in some areas. Therefore, you will be riding on the roadway in these locations. I suggest getting a Lake Trail map from your hotel or a local bike shop."
Lake Trail,4.5,"Sensational, Breathtaking Bike/Jog Trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Check out over-the-top opulent mansions, gorgeous manicured landscapes, unobstructed water and city skyline views, sumptuous yachts, and possibly some beautiful pelicans on this smoothly paved, traffic free phenomenal 6 mile bike/jog trail."
Lake Trail,4.5,Beautiful trail along the Intracoastal Waterway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This walking/biking trail is a gem in Palm Beach and usually has few people using it.  It goes a few miles on the east side of the waterway from the Society of the Four  Arts north to the northern part of the island.  It goes past majestic homes, a golf course, marina and the stately Whitehall, Henry Flagler's home,  that is now a museum.    If you are  visiting,  there is parking around Whitehall, in the lot and on the street.   There is also street parking on some of the side streets that lead to the trail.  There are no commercial establishments on the trail, so one might bring water, snacks, etc."
Lake Trail,4.5,Great way to see Palm Beach,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a great experience. We rented bikes from Palm Beach Cycle - they were great and easy to deal with!  Took the trail right from their parking lot.  There were 4 of us (with our older teen chilfren) - we saw Palm Beach from a cool prospective - between the boat docks and the fabulous homes of Palm Beach.  Easy ride - very flat, just have to be aware of walkers and runners along the way.  Would do it again !"
Lake Trail,4.5,Lake Trail Walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice leisurely way to walk along the water and see some impressive homes. One word of caution. We went in the middle of the day. Big mistake. The sun was beating down on us and we cut our visit short. In the middle of the day there is no shade on most of the walk. go early before 11:00 or after 4:00. We went in February and it was still kind of hot.
Lake Trail,4.5,A Nice Walk With Beautiful Scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Lake Trail is paved and about five miles one way. The Lake is on one side and multi million dollar mansions are on the other.  There were so many interesting things to see along the way.  Different types of doors leading to private piers where yachts are docked, palm trees with coconuts, and beautiful flowering shrubs and plants.  There are benches along the way where you can stop and take in the view. Sunscreen and water are a must since most of the trail is in the sun, and there are no restrooms.  We parked for free near the Society of The Four Arts and just walked a few blocks to pick up the southern portion of the trail."
Lake Trail,4.5,The Lake Trail - Palm Beach,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Trail stretches from the vicinity of the Flagler Museum - Whitehall - to nearly the north end of the town, perhaps 2-1/2 miles.. It runs mostly along the Lake Worth lagoon. It meanders and is paved, making it a welcome activity for bikers, roller bladers, and people just out for a walk. It runs between the estates and the water, so many of the yards are visible, which are often more interesting than their front elevations. The southernmost stretch is interrupted by construction of the North bridge but that is a minor inconvenience. Eventually, the trail will run under the traffic lanes. There is a drinking fountain around the Bradley park area near the south end but there are no other facilities, so be prepared. One can ride to the top of Palm Beach Island, where there is a dock and a drinking fountain for visitors. When the tide is coming in, many fish can be seen in the clear water while standing on the dock (it is NOT a boat landing) and from which the boat traffic at the Port of Palm Beach can be seen as it passes by.  Bikes can be rented close to the Trail, on North County Road."
Shafer Trail,4.5,"Literally cried, hands sweating buckets, and a death grip on the seat in front of me.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"You know that stomach dropping, regret-filled  feeling you get when you’re strapped into a roller coaster, wondering why you decided to do this and there’s no turning back, but you know it’s going to be fine and over before you know it? Well this is like that except you don’t know it’s going to be ok when you feel like any plethora of rocks could slide onto you, out from under you, or somehow end up off the narrow ledge/road, and it lasts an hour!!!  Every muscle in my body was sore afterwards from clenching my muscles and I literally cried.  All 3 of us were very scared. Then it started raining which made things even scarier. I wouldn’t do it again, nor recommend, but if you’re a thrill seeker who likes living on the edge (literally) then you’ll love it!"
Shafer Trail,4.5,Amazing Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a must drive if you have a high clearance, 4 wheel drive vehicle. We descended the trail in our Yukon XL. The trail had recently opened and still had snow in some locations which made for some scary hair pin turns. However, the views are amazing. We continued down the trail to the Potash road and on to highway 239. The road was pretty rough near the ponds."
Shafer Trail,4.5,Beautiful drive!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the Shafer trail from Canyonlands all the way back to Moab. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. We took it with a FWD Kia SUV, and we had no problem whatsoever. I personally do not think a 4WD is necessary, but high clearance is definitely a must to avoid damaging your vehicle. The switchback is the easiest part of the road as it is in very good condition, the rest of the road is trickier but nothing impassable. Took us 1h45 from Canyonlands back to Moab with a couple of stops for pictures. Definitely recommend it, as long as you are not afraid of heights and your vehicle has a high clearance."
Shafer Trail,4.5,Shafer Trail — Classic Moab,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Shafer Trail—About 18 miles from town of Moab to Canyon Lands Visitor Center.  Great trip, classic Moab “canyon country”.  Shafer Trail is easy road, any SUV, truck, stock jeep can handle with ease.  Recommend starting in town, so that you are climbing out of the canyon at the end (rather than starting from Canyon Lands turnoff immediately going down hill.  Very good, easy, intro to Moab “experience”."
Shafer Trail,4.5,F350 with dually top to bottom no problem,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Full sized F350 with dually went from top to bottom
Shafer Trail,4.5,Scary,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went in 2020 and this has become a near death story telling experience we share with friends lol.  Make sure you have enough gas, probably a good idea to have some food and water (just in case) and prepare for no cell service.  We were definitely unprepared and did not know what we were getting into.  By the time we realized it there was no turning back (literally).  We were overcome with fear for the entire two hours it took (13 miles, sharp switchbacks, going 8/9 mph) and our mortality became real.  Pretty sure we suffered with acute stress for a few days when trying to go to bed having flashbacks.  We can laugh about it now but I don’t think I would ever do that again."
Shafer Trail,4.5,"Switchbacks not so scary, but Potash Road no joke",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's way less scary than it's made out to be. Even in the narrowest part, you've got about 2 feet of space to the ledge. The ""fear"" factor is all mental. If you go slow, drive carefully and don't do anything dumb, there's virtually no risk of going over. Scary? Perhaps. Dangerous? No. I was in a 4Runner but could see some long wheelbase vehicles having trouble on the switchbacks. Even at that it's still probably not a big deal. You can see far ahead if someone is coming up then wait by a turn to squeeze through...On the other hand, Potash Road was no joke. The ""challenge"" in this road really starts when you get past the switchbacks. I suppose you can get through in low clearance and 2WD but there's a risk you're going to bottom out. There are a couple of rough sections and maneuvers. Took us about 2.5 hours from the top to get back to Moab."
Shafer Trail,4.5,wow best high roads of Utah back country ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the best road I have ever been on for a heart pounding rush ! I would compare it to the same height anxiety you may have on Gemini bridges road when you overlook Moab! This was phenomenal and the best time of year for weather. It reminds me of skydiving... but really really slowly, so it’s crazy feeling! I was nervous, my hubby was not - if you are like me and heights are kinda freaky don’t drive it have someone else drive. This is not for the faint of heart once you start descending you can’t turn back, you would have a heck of a time. We had our Jeep in 4 wheel drive - hubby put the Jeep in  4low so we didn’t ride the breaks! it’s a step road and can get bumpy. Don’t be mistaken this is a crazy road! The views are amazing and worth the adrenaline rush for sure!!! Loved it! Thank you UTAH!!!"
Shafer Trail,4.5,FUN!!!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was really fun!! Don't go beyond Shafer without a 4 wheel drive/high clearance  vehicle.  Potash Road, which is what you will drive if you don't turn around at the bottom,  is true off-roading.   We did continue with a 4-runner and it was great, but the wrong vehicle will leave you with car damage and regret.     It is also a terrible place to break down.  If you have the right vehicle, do Potash.  The views are spectacular and it takes about 3 hours.  Don't forget to stop at Thelma and Louis Point!"
Shafer Trail,4.5,Breathtaking views - well worth combining with Potash Rd,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Drove this the first week of August after some rainy spells so I was worried about mud (I-70 was temporarily blocked with flash flooding when we came through the day before). The park ranger warned of mud and ledges on Potash.
Watchman Trail,4.5,Moderately Difficult Hike with Wonderful Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My teenaged son and I hiked the Watchman Trail on our second day at Zion National Park.  The Trail head is a short walk from the visitor center and parking lot.  The hike is moderate in difficulty and is just over 3 miles round trip.  The beginning of the trail is easy, but then it begins to climb.  The elevation gain is moderate at just over 350 feet.  The views along the way are wonderful. and we really enjoyed this trail.  When we got up to top we took the trail extension onto the overlook viewpoint.  There are great views of the nearby mountains and down into the valley of the visitor center and parts of Springdale.  Of course the Watchman mountain in the background is impressive.  We hiked down the circuit and really enjoyed the hike.  If you are in the physical condition for a moderate hike with some elevation gain I recommend the Watchman Trail.  It is very nice."
Watchman Trail,4.5,Mud - Do NOT Try This Trail if Raining,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is listed as an amazing signature hike for Zion and I am sure it is.  I had wanted to see the view of the canyon from here.  Unfortunately, the day we first got to Zion and planned for this hike, it rained and rained hard.  While many places in the desert and in fact Zion have hikes you can do in the rain on rock, the base of this path is silt eroded from the canyon which simply turns to mud.   Anyone going to Zion probably has a less than 2% of this happening to them.  However, if it is raining for your trip pick another hike.  We were convinced to turn back after slogging through the mud only to be met by another hiker who had turned around further up saying it only get worse.  With that said, even a little elevation gives you great views into the canyon.  See the pictures."
Watchman Trail,4.5,Worth the hike!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I'd give it 5 stars but the trail at this time of the year was exceptionally muddy (red thick mud) for a good portion of the trail. It took our family 3 hours (we parked in the visitor center lot). There are some drop-offs which may cause some anxiety in people with fear of heights but these were only for small portions of the trail. Wear layers as it is all uphill with some stretches that are flat and when the sun was out even in this cool weather we got quite warm. The view at the overlook at the top is worth it. 
Watchman Trail,4.5,My favorite hike in Zion,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved this trail! It is strictly uphill on the way,  downhill coming back. It will give you a good workout. There are terrific views all around at the end. There's a loop trail at the end that you can take if you choose, which will take about 10-15 minutes. There was a good amount of people on the trail when I went in the early afternoon, but not too many. "
Watchman Trail,4.5,Always Worth It,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not the most beautiful hike ever been on, but still great scenery. In the heat of the late morning, our mistake, still plenty of hikers of all ages and abilities were there. It is to my knowledge the only trail close to the park that you don’t need to enter the park by bus appointment, so you have the freedom to hike there whenever you choose."
Watchman Trail,4.5,Good Hike for a change of pace,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"On Friday we spent 5 1/2 hours hiking the Narrows, it was fantastic but also made for a very full and tiring day.  On Saturday we were looking for a more relaxed casual day, and the Watchman Trail was perfect for us. It took us 1.5 hours round-trip including the loop at the top.  A little strenuous on the way up but not too bad, and it was a breeze coming back down.  It may not be as majestic or awe-inspiring as the Narrows or Angels Landing, but it’s still a very beautiful hike."
Watchman Trail,4.5,Moderate trail with easy access,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose this trail because we were unable to get parking further into the park and our only option was to start from the Visitor's Center. It was a moderate hike that was pretty easy to complete. We had 3 adults, 3 kids (8, 9, 11 year)s and 2 kids (3, 6 years). The older kids had no trouble. The 6 year old did a bit of complaining, but made it no problem. The 3 year old had to be carried most of the way. Overall, it was a fun hike and a great alternative since the park's other parking lots and shuttle service were closed. You end with a pretty good view of the entrance to Zion, but not much more than what you can see from the ground, so don't get your hopes up for a life-changing finale. We did enjoy the small stream and grotto near the top that cooled off the hike a bit and gave a short change of scenery. "
Watchman Trail,4.5,Accessible ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"While I like the views deeper in the canyon, you can’t beat how close this is to the Watchman Campground. It’s short and climbs some so it will give you a workout but has a nice view at the end looking down on the visitor center and Springdale. I appreciate there’s a loop on top so the trail is not only an out-and-back walk."
Watchman Trail,4.5,Great Hike starts  behind Visitor Center,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A great trail to leave from the visitor center (no shuttle pass required!).  This was our first hike at Zion - took about 2 1/2 hours taking our time and plenty of pictures.  Loved it!   It was sunny starting out, but after canyon switchbacks we had more shade.  Helped us acclimate to elevation change and hiking coming from FL"
Watchman Trail,4.5,Great Hike!  No shuttle Required! Very scenic!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to forego the long shuttle wait and start our day hiking The WatchMan Trail, which you can get right on from the visitor center.  Gorgeous view when you reach the top, worth the hike!  It took my family about 2 hours to hike this 3.3 mile trail. We saw deer on our hike.  It was rocky and sandy but an easy path to follow."
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,If you don't mind the sounds of cars ...,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very well maintained trail with nice views at Carter Overlook. Mostly shady. Only downside is that you can hear cars and trucks on the nearby road which runs alongside the trail essentially the entire way. I prefer my walks in the woods to be mostly filled with the sounds of nature. Right now, they are strongly suggesting masks, especially on the ten 'boardwalks' which they have deemed not wide enough for physical distancing. You can walk all the way to Monticello from the base of the trail ... but you have to purchase a ticket to walk onto the grounds of Monticello. Right now, all ticket purchases are on line."
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,Watch out for the Mask-Bullies,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went with a small group of friends for some safe, healthy, outdoor fun, prior to apple picking. We read the posted Covid signs that says masks were recommended. Since they are NOT required we opted to forego them in order to enjoy the fresh air and exercise safely and most effectively. By nature the area is the very definition of social distancing. Even so, and even though our kids were spread out, people yelled at us, made rude gestures, and acted foolishly and in opposition to the RULES at least a handful of times. It was absurd. "
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,A pleasant walk and a good workout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked from the lower end of the trail near Virginia State Route 53 to the upper end leading to the David M. Rubenstein Visitor Center.  The trail is well-groomed and wide  but it is  also a good workout since it goes up and down a mountain.  Quite a few of the plants are labeled and the ten extended boardwalks are elevated enough to provide good views.  There are also plenty of benches along the trail. The Rubinstein Visitor Center is very convenient.  Even if you don’t buy tickets for Monticello, you may use the restrooms, eat at the café, and visit the gift shop, and enjoy the surrounding grounds.  "
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,Lovely Walk for All Ages,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked in the lot off Rte. 20 so that we would be walking uphill on the first leg of the  trip and downhill on the way back. It’s two miles each way. It is a relatively easy walk with a slight constant grade. The scenery is nice, especially the view from Carter’s Overlook—be sure to take that short spur off the main trail for a great view."
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,Hillside Romp,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We didn't take the most popular paved and boardwalked part of this trail - but instead lost ourselves among the rougher and quieter hillside trails above. We were quite happy to do so. We couldn't quite find the trial head from the Monticello parking lot - but we drove down to the separate trail spot outside of Monticello and got on the way.  The walk was hilly but mostly quiet and pleasant - what you would expect.  We would like to go back again and hike the rest of the trails as well.
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,"Gorgeous, unexpected",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is one of my favorite things in Charlottesville. It is an arboretum with tree specimens, is dog-friendly up to the boardwalks, and you can walk all the way up to Monticello's visitor's center, get a snack (and pee!), and walk back down. Or you can take the trail and then do the whole Monticello visit. Don't miss the side trails--my favorite is Secluded Farm, which takes you to the most beautiful meadow in the area, in my opinion. Great for families, since there are some old tulip poplar stumps that have been turned into a play structure, and a pond near the bottom of the trail with frogs!"
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,Watch out for mask scofflaws,2.0 of 5 bubbles,I love the Saunders Trail; it has been one of my favorite places to run and walk for 20 years. 
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,Tried to hike to Monticello ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This path looks amazing. Read the reviews and decided we would park in the Dairy Barn lot and walk to Monticello to see the grounds. We had our two dogs with us. I noted that some trails are not open to pets. Fine, no mention that less than a mile from the parking lot as you come upon the boardwalk is a large sign that tells you no dogs from this point on- feel free to enjoy any of the other trails. At this point there are no trail maps unless you back track to one of the parking lots. And it appears this is the only one that leads to Monticello ( where dogs are welcome on the grounds)."
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,"Nice trail, but NOT FREE to walk to Monticello",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The official website for the Saunders-Monticello trail says nothing about requiring you to have a ticket just to finish the walk up to Monticello.  Tour or not, you are officially required to purchase a ticket ($25 in advance, marked up to $28 at the door) just to finish what should be a free hiking trail.  There are no discounted tickets just to walk around.  With some luck you might be able to skirt the people checking for tickets at the shuttle, but your best bet is to try to avoid those stairs/checkpoint entirely and go a slight roundabout way via one of the shuttle roads before meeting up with the trail.  Not a sure thing and they will ask to see your ticket if they see you walking up from the visitor center.  Did not see anyone asking for tickets once you get up to Monticello."
Saunders-Monticello Trail,4.5,Beautiful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If it's your first time here and at Monticello, I wouldn't do both at the same time.  2 mile hike to Monticello, 3hr tour and a 2 mile back was harsh!"
Great Head Trail,4.5,Should be warnings ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I think most people do the small loop from Sand Beach because we did the entire larger loop starting in the parking lot right outside the park before sand beach. This trail is gorgeous with spectacular views. It starts easy then gradually gets a little steeper going up some rocky steps which were pretty easy. At the topnit us pure rock and beautiful! As you start to go down and around the loop it is pretty much all rock and very steep boulders down so much of the trail is rock scrambling. There is also quite a bit of mud due to recent rains. Just be prepared because we saw many with little babies, toddlers and some elderly people that were not happy the trail reviews say easy. I do not know if there are ways to avoid that part of the trail however there should be warnings to make sure people wear appropriate shoes and are prepared for the hike.  "
Great Head Trail,4.5,Great hike but watch your route ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love hiking and I would say we are somewhat experienced hikers. There are two routes you can take. One is super easy and flat to great head. If you want to do a full loop though, it is a pretty challenging hike up or down on the blue trail. The views are completely worth it, just be prepared with good shoes. The NPS should label the challenging part of the hike a bit better."
Great Head Trail,4.5,Fun hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our family really enjoyed this hike. The trailhead is at the far end of Sand Beach. The views on the hike were beautiful. There were few others on the hike, which made it even more enjoyable since some areas of the park are so crowded."
Great Head Trail,4.5,Hiking Acadia National Park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The drive up Cadillac Mt. was worth the fee to go. The views are spectacular. The trails on the rocks are gentle, even for 65+ yr. old hikers such as my husband and me. We tried to hike Jordan Pond the day we arrived. Too crowded, no place to park. We went back 2 days later and went early in the morning so we could park. Barring that, go to visitor center and take the bus. Jordan Pond was my favorite hike. Level, flat rocks, boardwalk and gravel. Views were awesome. I walked at a pretty good clip, it took me about 1- 1/2 hrs to complete. "
Great Head Trail,4.5,Amazing Views of Acadia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Park Loop Road was busy so we decided to park off Schooner Head road which was a great choice. From there we made loop that took you to sand beach and Great Head. The trail offers amazing views of Sand beach and the rugged Maine coastline. It is of mild to moderate difficulty and takes about 1-2 hours.
Great Head Trail,4.5,Worth it for this excellent hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is NOT for kids under 8 or so. We really loved this walk and only saw maybe half a dozen other people, despite it being high season. We parked at the lot off of Schooner Head Road, and I recommend that. Sand Beach parking was crazy full. "
Great Head Trail,4.5,Good hike for family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great medium difficulty trail.  Definitely had to scramble up/down/over rocks.  It was muddy in parts fire to rainy week. And views were good considering clouds and fog. Would be amazing on a clear day!
Great Head Trail,4.5,What a work out!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful views from this trail.  Picked up the trail from Sandy Beach in Acadia. The terrain was rough...rocky, climbing up and down over large boulders.  Parts of the trail were muddy and doable. Your legs get a great workout on this trail!"
Great Head Trail,4.5,Beautiful views....must do this one!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Great Head Trail is magnificent.  Scrambling up the pink granite rock is well worth the effort to  enjoy the vistas and the topographically interesting trail.  We went with our 6yr old and our 13 yr old and never heard a complaint about being tired, despite it being a more physical challenge than other hikes in the park.  We went in the evening, and the lighting at this time was beautiful, plus no one else was on the trail.  The sun didn't set until 8:15 so we had plenty of time to enjoy.  The views of Otter Point are wonderful, as is the view of Frenchman's Bay and the Schoodic Peninsula.  If you only have time to do one hike in Acadia, let it be this one!"
Great Head Trail,4.5,A worthwhile hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the Great Head Trail and found it to be challenging (we are fairly new to hiking) and well worth it!  The sites of the Sand Beach and the Harbors are gorgeous.  Its a moderate level hike so make sure you have the appropriate shoes (many people stumble onto the trail from the beach and think they can hike it in their flip flops).  The hike is for kids over 10 and people who are in fairly good shape.  Its not for small children, though as the rocks that you climb will take a bit of effort.  There are plenty of places to sit and look out over the ocean while you eat a packed lunch."
Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,Worth a visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rent a bike at pine creek outfitters flat, easy ride, you can do a half day and take your time or go all day and rock out.  We walked and bike.  You can leave bike on trail, walk and return to bike back to store"
Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,Riding along this very scenic trail.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We have been camping at Petticoat Junction Campground and riding along this Pine Creek Trail for some 4 years now.  We like the mentioned campground for many reasons but one major reason is that we literally ride our bikes from our campsite maybe 100 yards to a slight ramp which leads to the old railroad line.  This has been extremely well maintained and as the incline is very slight along these several miles of trail my wife and I enjoy a leisurely ride along Pine Creek.  Along with enjoying the beautiful scenery of the Pine Creek Gorge we often get to see various wildlife doing whatever and occasional rafters and  Canoeists traveling downstream.   Again, as I am a sometimes bike rider I like this easy stretch.      "

Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,Biking rail trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Road from Ansonia to Rattlesnake rock.   Easiest 19 miles ever and nice.   Would recommend going in spring when creeks are flowing or fall for the colors.  Trail is amazingly well taken care of.  Saw a couple eagles.  Took 2.5 hours of casual riding.  Good swimming at rattlesnake rock and ice cream back up the road a bit
Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,Beautiful ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The leaves are changing (last week of September) and the trail was in great condition but dusty. There were a lot of people at some spots (Rattlesnake Rock) but there were miles where we were alone on the trail.  We did the Ansonia to Slate Run, and I highly recommend that ride (30 miles). Truly almost flat, and easy riding, broken up by a couple small towns. And the restrooms are mostly clean and convenient. Take water and lunch if you do this section, the towns are in the last 10 miles. "
Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,Gorgeous trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We rented bikes from Pine Creek Outfitters. Rode on this trail and it was beautiful and well maintained. We were a little too ambitious and we got quite tired at the end so we were walking alongside our bikes. So many people asked if we were alright. We were. Just tired. Everyone was so friendly. It was a nice day and the trail is flat which is great for those of us who are not avid bikers. Lots of places to stop and rest rooms along the way. It was a very relaxing and peaceful day.
Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the ole stagecoach wagon tours onto the rail to trails path down into the gorge. It was well worth the money. Stunning beauty of mother nature. Pine Creek was very low, they were having a bad drought when we visited in late August 2020. "
Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,World Class Rail Trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just go, this is one of the best, from someone who has done a lot of rail trails and other biking trips.  We did Ansonia-Slate Run and had Pine Creek Outfitters (who are great) drop our car at Slate Run so we could bike the 28 miles one-way. Great day!"
Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,Excellent Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sorry for the delay in posting this review. A crashed hard drive, misplaced travel notes and life got in the way.   We hiked on various sections of this trail on August 31 & September 1 & 3, 2020.  The trail is wide smooth and very well marked.  There is plenty off places to stop and observe for birds.   Free maps and restrooms are available at many locations along the trail.   If you are in the area this makes for a great day hike."
Pine Creek Rail Trail,5.0,Best Ride and most scenic Ride Ever,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rode from the start in Wellsboro to Slate Run in about 4 hours.  It was drizzly in the beginning but we were prepared with rain gear.  That didn't dampen our experience as there were spots of amazing fall colors, beautiful along the stream and the train was very well maintained with bathrooms every 5 or so miles.  Highly recommend it and we will be back! "
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,Pretty Area,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Temple of Sinawava trail is a mostly-paved path that leads to the Riverwalk area at the northern end of the Zion Canyon. There are interesting landscapes to see, and the walk follows the Zion River.  The paved path ends once you reach the river walk.  Overall, we found the Angel's Landing hike to be much more interesting and picturesque with elevated views. If you aren't going to do the Riverwalk, you can skip this hike if you have time constraints."
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,360 degree AWESOME!!!!!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was all awesome, can't wait to go back. Traveled from Texas to Vegas straight to Zion, was like a kid  waiting to get to the toy store, my wife was wanting to go back the following month. The hardest thing to do after visiting Zion is deciding which near duplicate picture to delete."
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,Zion,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a beautiful park at a scale that is hard to fathom. Take as many trails as you can. Ride the shuttle bus to save your feet. Arrive early and park free at the Visitor’s Center.
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,Did not want to leave - incredible oasis!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This one-mile trail was probably the highlight of our 10-day trip across the Southwest.  Starting at the end of the scenic drive in Zion (accessible only by free shuttle), this flat trail follows the Virgin River through Zion Canyon as it narrows to a slot canyon.  During our visit in mid June, the water flow was still to great from snowmelt for anyone to enter the narrows, but that just leaves us something to look forward to on our next trip (and we WILL be back - there's no way we could stay away!).  "
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,This is the tral on the way to the Narrows,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the trail which starts at shuttle stop 9. It is also known by some as the Riverside Walk. It is basically the trail, mostly paved from this shuttle stop to the narrows start about a mile down canyon. An easy walk, with little elevation changes, great colors and views along the way. Quite crowded with people just on the trail as well as others going on to hike/explore the Narrows.  "
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,Walk Beside the River Through A Rocky Canyon,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clarification: This trail is named ""Riverside Walk"" and the trail head is in the north end of Zion Canyon at a geologic formation named Temple of Sinawava (Zion Shuttle stop 9, about 7 miles from the visitor center). To reach it, you must pay entry fees to the park, park your vehicle, then ride the free shuttle into Zion Canyon, which is closed to private vehicles. The Riverside Walk hugs the Virgin River and leads between high canyon walls covered with ""hanging gardens"" to the trail head for The Narrows. The scenery is outstanding, and we saw a deer grazing right beside the path. In the morning it was mostly shaded by the sheer canyon walls. The trail surface is paved and easy to walk, with some minor slopes. The park service describes this trail as wheelchair-accessible and we did take a wheelchair on it, but only the first section is truly accessible. As the trail goes farther north, there are short, steep hills and areas with a coating of sand which makes it difficult to maintain traction. We managed to take the wheelchair all the way to the end (a mile one-way) but I had a very able and determined assistant. Benches and large rocks are available for rest stops. This trail is crowded with both out-of-shape tourists who need an easy walk and more experienced hikers who are on their way to the more-challenging Narrows. I suggest going as early as possible, and weekdays might be less popular. There is a restroom at the shuttle stop/trail head."
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,Riverside walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a gentle walk along the riverside.  It allowed the hiker to experience the changes of the river, park wildlife (chipmunks and deer), water meandering off the rock walls and dripping off plants and even a swamp.  The wild flowers are hard to spot, but if you stop to look, you will find the beauty of the small flowers.  At the end of the trail, you can depart from the trail end, hike up the river into the Narrows.   I wish we had more time.  I hear that's an impressive experience."
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is nothing special on this trail and it is a dead end! You probably will not see the narrow canyon in the pictures.  Not unless you are willing to wade across the fast-moving river - on slippery rocks - with or without shoes, and continue hiking."
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,Best of the Easy & Handicap Accessible Trails and Worthwhile for All Hikers,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This mostly flat, paved trail, also known as the Riverside Walk, begins at the last shuttle stop at the end of the canyon scenic drive and follows the Virgin River upstream for 1.1m (1.8k) to the beginning of the Narrows where the river completely fills the canyon floor, cutting through the sandstone, producing a narrow canyon with vertical cliffs of more than 1000ft (300m). The trail starts with the sandstone cliffs of the Temple of Sinawava soaring above you, good views of the Great White Throne and, looking closely, hikers can be seen high above along the cliffs the West Rim Trail.  The floor of the Temple is lush and shady with a large stone formation that looks like an altar which leads to the area’s name.  This lush shady environment continues as one heads upstream along the trail and as the canyon wall closes in on the one side, springs and hanging gardens can be easily observed.  Despite the large number of people using this trail the walk was very pleasant and we saw deer, turkeys and many squirrels along the trail and river bottoms.  At the end of the trail there is an excellent view of the Narrows and one can step off the pavement onto a sandy shore and walk out into the shallow river for even better views.  Returning the direction one came from results in a hike of about 2.2m (3.5k).  This is certainly one of the best easy and handicap accessible trails we have taken anywhere yet is worthwhile for all.  Restrooms and water is available at the trailhead."
Temple of Sinawava Trail,4.5,Easy hike to the Narrows; a must do/see; highly recommended!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had only 1 full day in Zion and did not plan to do the Narrows so decided on this trail.  It was my favorite hike in Zion.  It's easy and very scenic following the river.  A must do/see and highly recommended!
Tennessee Riverpark,4.5,Underwhelming,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"After reading so many great reviews, I was seriously underwhelmed by the Chattanooga river walk. It’s trumped up to be far more than it is. Past the statues,  some of the river was “curtained off” so I couldn’t see it at all. Other river walks in other towns are far more impressive"
Tennessee Riverpark,4.5,E-bike paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a lovely city Chattanooga is! Stayed at spring hill suites right on waterfront path.

Tennessee Riverpark,4.5,This business is closed,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Tripadvisor agents helped us to book the tour by phone, assured us it was still operating, then the day of the event there was no boat or captain to be found. Also, no one answered at the business number. I'm not sure how this listing got here. If someone is trying to spoof the old Chattanooga Cycleboats biz that closed, perhaps that is what is happening."
Tennessee Riverpark,4.5,Indefinite closure,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"A major portion of the park east of downtown has been closed indefinitely due to the vaccination effort.  Surely, with some forethought, ways to accommodate both recreational use (so vital during this pandemic) and vaccinations can be found.  At a minimum, the website should expand the current minimal closure notice to explain why the extensive closure is needed."
Tennessee Riverpark,4.5,Had a Great Family Gathering,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our family had a family gathering and lunch together here.  The park is clean and beautifully maintained.

Tennessee Riverpark,4.5,10 miles of fun,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This 10 mile long park is mostly by the river, but there are areas where it curves into some industrial locations.

Tennessee Riverpark,4.5,We visited,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For our spring break. I really wanted to see that water on the stairs, but it was off and it looked like there was renovation going on in this area. The river was higher then what I seen in pictures and there was any railing on the walkways. We made the best of it. Because it had rained earlier and I had already had rainbows for my clan, we where able to slash around and have fun. I would really love to come back when it is warmer. "
Tennessee Riverpark,4.5,Calling all runners!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you enjoy road running, this is a must for you. Great 8 mile run from the Chickamauga Dam to the Riverpark.

Rainbow Point,4.5,the last stop in the scenic drive,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s located at the end of the scenic drive, the elevation is 9115 feet, there is a parking lot, for there, you can go to Yovimpa point which is a few minutes walk. There is also a trail called “Bristlecone loop” that you can walk, it’s a 1-mile loop easy level trail. There are exhibition boards explain the geology of the Bryce canyon. If you don't walk the trail, you may spend less than 1 hr here, but if you walk the trail, may need more time."
Rainbow Point,4.5,Amazing High Elevation Views in Bryce Canyon National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rainbow Point is at the end of the Bryce Canyon Road in Bryce Canyon National Park.  It is one of the highest points in the park.  The elevation is 9,115 feet.  It was considerably colder and windier at Rainbow Point than down near the Amphitheater.  The views are terrific from here.  It is a little bit of a drive to get up here and the drive is winding and uphill, but it is worth the journey.  There is parking right near the Rainbow Point overlook so there is no hiking involved.   I recommend a visit the Rainbow Point."
Rainbow Point,4.5,On a clear day . . .,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"They say you can see forever from here, looking north across the expanse of Bryce Canyon National Park. Unfortunately, we didn't have a clear day. At the park's highest point (elevation 9,115 ft.), we were in the clouds. Still, I recommend coming here directly after stopping at the visitor center."
Rainbow Point,4.5,Go here first,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s beautiful and less crowded here. Not quite as amazing as others, so go here first before you get jaded."
Rainbow Point,4.5,Gorgeous,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The view at Rainbow Point is very expansive and really gives you a long range perspective of the beautiful panorama.  It is definitely worth the drive to the end of the road.  There are also some trails to hike which depart from the point.
Rainbow Point,4.5,Great views and hiking trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A great view here with some difficulty of parking when driving your car.  Arrive early or later in the day, or take the park shuttles.  It is at the end of the scenic drive and takes about 20 minutes to get there.  It also offer access to a couple hiking trails."
Rainbow Point,4.5,The Far End of the Canyon,3.0 of 5 bubbles,This is located at the very end of the Bryce Canyon National Park.  It's elevation is 9115 feet. It offers a nice view of the plateaus of Utah.   This viewpoint has several wonderful picture story board that help illustrate Bryce Canyon's geology and how the canyon was formed.   This helps to put into perspective the wonders that the other viewpoints have to offer.
Rainbow Point,4.5,Rainbow Point is a great mix of views and enchanting Alpine Forest.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Everything in Bryce is stunning, but Rainbow Point just puts and exclamation point on everything that you have seen up to this point.  The highway finally ends at the southernmost point and you are 9100 ft. up in the air. "
Rainbow Point,4.5,"Beautiful, also, take the twice-a-day tour bus",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Everything at Bryce is worth seeing, honestly -- we booked seats on the Rainbow Point Tour Bus (it's free with park admission and runs twice a day, the tour is 3.5 hours total), and naturally it comes to Rainbow Point.  The best part of the tour is that you find out so much about the area, the features (they come and go, as part of the erosion!), and our tour guide was incredibly experienced and knowledgeable.  Rainbow Point, LOVELY!  Go there, however you can do it.  The bus tour is highly recommended."
Rainbow Point,4.5,The highest elevation in Bryce Canyon National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Visitors to Bryce Canyon National Park are often encouraged to begin their automobile tour by driving directly to the very southern end first. From here, at Rainbow Point, at the highest elevation in the park at 9,100 feet, the entirety of the park stretches out before you back to the north. But before you leave Rainbow Point, make sure you walk to the southern outlook, Yovimpa Point. Here is one of the places you can get a good look at the sequence of rock layers called the Grand Staircase. The sections or steps in the Grand Staircase are named for the dominant color of rock. You are standing on the top step known as the Pink Cliffs. Directly below you are the Grey Cliffs. As you look into the distance you can see Molly's Nipple, which is part of the White Cliffs. Looking down into distant canyons near the horizon, you can just make out some red rock underneath the White Cliffs. This red rock makes up the Vermillion Cliffs. Hidden from view but directly under the towering Vermillion Cliffs are the comparatively diminutive Chocolate Cliffs. The tree-covered hills that meet the horizon belong to the Kaibab Plateau--the  North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Back to Rainbow Point, where visitors can look northward and clearly see the Pink Cliffs out of which the Hoodoos have been sculpted. The cliffs curve around amphitheaters carved by the headward erosion of small streams and tributaries to the Paria River in times of flow. The entire Pink Cliffs of Bryce are but a single step in the much larger Grand Staircase. At Rainbow Point, the forest is dominated by Blue Spruce, Douglas Fir and White Fir. This kind of forest makes good habitat for grouse, woodpeckers, owls and a variety of squirrels and chipmunks. Spending a few minutes at Rainbow Point and Yovimpa Point will give you a geologic and geographic orientation, helping you to better understand the landscape and land forms that surround Bryce Canyon National Park."
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,Thank God it's free,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you're wanting to see any wildlife, you'll be disappointed. Saw a couple geese and a couple turtles... Yawn.  If you enjoy walking through the woods and seeing trees and plants, you'll enjoy it. The boardwalk is beautiful, itself, and well maintained. We only interacted with one employee and he was polite. Bathrooms located at both ends were adequate. There were a few people enjoying the water swimming or rafting. Aside from the jets flying over and the sounds of traffic on both ends, it's very quiet and peaceful. There are trash cans throughout the boardwalk which helps keep the wetlands clean of trash. Sadly, there are more trash cans than animals."
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,Disappointed but understand,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were so looking forward to a hike on this trail as we have heard so much about it.  Once we got there we found out that our two small dogs (that stay confined to a stroller) could not go into the park with us.  As a result, we had to leave.  Since we are traveling and do not wish to leave the dogs unattended in a hotel room, we had to leave. "
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,Nice hike ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This place has mile long boardwalk With swimming and kayaking spots also along creek . Very nicely maintained and restrooms avail at both ends of  park. Is nice relaxing stroll or can jog and dog walk. 
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,Just do it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the nicest,and unexpected, things to do in the FWB/Destin area. Take a couple of hours and chill out. Walk the deck and enjoy the nature. If water is high you can do the float, if not, just enjoy the walk. Can’t go wrong, peace out, "
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,Nice place to walk and see nature ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We took a morning walk here before going to the beach. Very nice board walk trail. Kept up very nice. It’s a 2 mile round trip walk along turkey creek. If you want to tube down the creek you must bring your pie tubes. I wish we would have had some the water looked so refreshing on a hot summer day. 
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,So beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a beautiful scenic walk over a built walk way.  The walk is just over a mile one way.   There are a few areas to stop and look over the water, people swam in areas, definitely a place to drop a tube and go with the current .   "
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,Too many rules,3.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a beautiful park. Great for walking and swimming. They just have so many rules you can't even enjoy it. Everywhere you look there are signs telling you all the things they won't let you do. They also have old people that I assume are volunteers that strictly enforce these rules. You can't even bring a coke in the park. No food or drinks except water. If they would get rid of these enforcers and tear the signs down it would be a great place. I always feel like I am in a police state when I am there.
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,What a great place to just walk and relax......,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You can have a picnic here, walk, run, or get your tub or raft and just float or canoe down the creek. The temp of the water stay pretty consistent around 65 I believe. Just a bit of a warning on several things: there is no smoking on or around the nature trail, and if its hot out it will be fairly crowded and there are lots of teen aged kids there hanging out and running around it can be kind of intimidating at times. But the good news is they have people who patrol the area so you are safe there. As with any place don't leave your things unattended. "
Turkey Creek Nature Trail,4.5,"Beautiful, peaceful and clean",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since I live in the area, I have been to Turkey Creek many times. I always feel safe even walking by myself.

This place is a treasure!"

Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,Great Colorado Variety for Visitors,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Visiting for an extended weekend and loved this area.  It has many well marked trails traversing different areas from steep ascents with stunning views to flat gravel trails alongside crystal clear creeks, gorgeous rock formations, and picnic tables.  Our advice:  arrive early in the day, as parking is limited, especially on the weekends.  We grabbed what spots we could find along the road in and ended up with 2 days of enjoyable hiking in completely different areas.  Our 10 and 12 yo boys loved it!"
Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,Experience Nature,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are from Indiana, so the altitude made a difference in our hiking, in that we did have to take some"" catch your breath moments"" I am 77 so maybe that is the reason. The forest and water are so refreshing, and the trail is well marked, although steep in some areas. We got hit by a thunderstorm that included hail. That however made the experience more memorable. If you are not used to hiking, or are not physically active this trail could be a little challenging. It is up  the mountain all the way. I did not find the trail well marked. From the parking lot, look for a gravel road going up. If you take the one going down, you will end up in Colorado Springs! About a mile down the road, there is a trail to the right, no sign. Take it. You can stay on gravel road and hike, but not sure what you see. On seven bridges, you have water in sight as well as a well shaded path. We saw families with young  children on the trail. I am not sure that made it to all 7 Bridges and then the top."
Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,"Wonderful trail, but crowded",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a lovely, shaded trail next to a beautiful sream. There is a great view at the top as well. However, parking was difficult on an off-peak weekday, and the trail was relatively crowded. Also, the uncover colorado site says the trail is rated ""easy"". The length (5.5+ miles) and the elevation gain (1500 ft), combined with the high altitude (8200 ft) would make it more of a  ""moderate"" hike to this sea level flatlander. It was beautiful, and free. Worth the visit, but very crowded and noisy, so that detracted from the beautiful scenery."
Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,Great hiking trail!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hike! We went with our two kids ages 7 and 10. It was a clear day with excellent views. Be prepared to hike. We got there early around 8:30 and were able to get parking. I think we got the last spot at the top! When we were leaving, there were several cars trying to get spots, so we told one to follow us to our spot. We also wanted to avoid too much heat on our hike by going early.  I would definitely recommend lots of water and going early. We got through all seven bridges and enjoyed our view from the top."
Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,Fun family trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So good! Family of 10, ages 11-45 years old. Everyone enjoyed this trail! Beautiful trail following the path of rushing water.

Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,"Great hiking experience with easy to moderate, well maintained trails.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hiking experience with easy to moderate, well maintained trails. We drove on the acres road which turns into a gravel road for the last 15 minutes or so, to include 2 short tunnels for cars within the mountain. At the end of the road there is ample parking space. We took the uphill trail which then will lead to the Seven bridges side trail.  All together from the parking we walked 45 minutes to reach the fourth bridge and then turned back. There was light snow part of the way."
Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,Family favorite!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We have lived here over 25 years and this is always a family favorite. I've read lots of the reviews and I'm pretty sure they are reviewing 7 Falls not 7 Bridges. There is no food, stairs, elevator or fee to park. The bad reviews are definitely referring to 7 Falls."
Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,Beautiful Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very beautiful trail.  Parking can be a little tricky - we got lucky and got the last spot!  You do have to walk about 3/4 mile from the parking lot to the trail head.  Obviously there are 7 bridges on the trail and depending on the snow melt, the water levels can vary.  It was very beautiful last week and the flowers were blooming.  We found this to be a good trail to help us ""flat-landers"" adjust before going to the higher elevation mountains.  Drink lots of water if you are from lower elevations and you will be just fine!"
Seven Bridges Trail,4.5,Good Hike - check peak season,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Pros - great hike with pavement or dirt trail, lots of stop points, great views, cute shops, neat cave to elevator if can’t or don’t want to do the stairs to the lookouts, shade available with trees if need a break, great picture backdrops"

Atlanta BeltLine Eastside Trail,4.5,This is a must do to really immerse yourself in the city.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I discovered this by complete chance and loved it. It got me away from the mid town tourist area. It is safe, clean, and has lots of restaurants and shops along the way. The only thing I did not like is too many bicycles and scooters so it can seem precarious walking. But that was more of a nuisance than a reason to stay away. I loved my evening strolling along."

The down side is Atlanta carries a heavy weight of crime.  And it's at the beltline trail. Do not go alone.
Atlanta BeltLine Eastside Trail,4.5,Best place to visit in the city of Atlanta,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Beltline is a wonderful place to visit. I first found out about the Beltline in 2013 and having been visiting it regularly since then. The possibilities are endless when visiting this awesome trail. Go for a run. Go for walk. Go for a bike ride. If you start on the north end, you can visit Piedmont Park for a day in the park, or grab a bite to eat at Park Tavern. After that, head further south and you run into Ponce City Market. Stop here for shopping and/or more eating and drinking. Keep heading south. Keep an eye on the skyline. Beautiful views of the city are all along the trail. You will eventually pass an open field where people are playing football, soccer, Frisbee, yoga, etc. Head under the bridge and you will be in Inman Park, which is one of the best neighborhoods in Atlanta. Incredible restaurants are located in this area. Keep moving south and you will run into Lady Bird, a bar/restaurant tucked away in the trees off the trail. Stop in here for another drink. Keep moving south and you eventually run into Irwin Street and Krog Market. Once again, another fantastic place to eat and/or have a drink. The temporarily stops here, but construction is underway to continue path south. Eventually, the Beltline will circle the entire city. We are all excited to see how many more cool things come out of this trail. Before the trail was officially called the Beltline, it’s prior use was as railroads for trains that traveled around the city many many years ago."
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Note about Yampa River,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My note is about the Yampa River, not the core trail (I couldn't find a category for the Yampa River alone).  We visited in July 2021 and were looking forward to tubing the Yampa River with the tubes we had brought.  The local publications recommend tubing from June-August, BUT when we arrived, they had shut down the river to all recreation.  Apparently the water temperatures are getting too warm for the fish, and tubing makes them even higher??  Just a warning for others hoping to tube.  //  If you visit the core trail, make sure you check out the Sulfur Spring close to the library.  It smells worse than anything we smelled in Yellowstone.  A must smell!  ;)"
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Challenging and scenic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I took long walks every morning I was in Steamboat along the Yampa River Core Trail.  It winds along the river to downtown.  You can walk or run as far as you like.  It was chilly in the early morning (40 degrees) but just take an extra layer.  I stayed on the side of the mountain so I got a good uphill climb on the finish.
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Do it on a Fat Tire Bike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented some fat tire bikes from Wheels Bike Shop (Ski Haus and Orange Peel had sold all their summer rental bikes already) and rode the trail up and back. It was cold (wear good gloves) but a silly-easy ride. We are experienced road cyclists, so we were in it just to look at the sights and get a fell for the fat tire bikes. You can rent them for one hour or three. We rode for an hour and easly saw everything we wanted to see."
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Beautiful but Dangerours Tourists,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great bike path BUT....  This is advertised as a non motorized bike/hike path.  Howerver, the number of tourists on eBikes with a throttle is downright dangerous.  As a regular bike rider you are traveling under your own power at a moderate speed.  But when we were there, many tourists were on the path traveling at a high rate of speed with no regard to speed limits.  They were also passing on blind corners creating a big hazard.  I had to YELL at several for being reckless.  The town of Steamboat Springs definitely needs to addrss this.  I doubt I will ride this trail in the future."
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Fun trail..,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Have used this trail many times while we have visited Steamboat in the summer and winter.  Summer time is great for walking, biking, and just taking in the sights.  Winter time is great for snow shoeing and just enjoying the views of the snow everywhere.  It is easily accessible and has a number of stopping points to relax and take a break."
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Great scenery,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail us flat and scenic. Good for biking, running or walking. It was busy mid day, during the week. It is most scenic in the middle third, which goes through the downtown area. Nice views of the various ski runs. Great access to restaurants. Seems like a great artery to various spots, including the botanical gardens, over its 10 mile stretch. Look for an Osprey nest right by the botanical gardens bike gate."
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Easy trail with nice views and very convenient to both town and ski area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great easy trail with nice views of the river.  Main part is paved. We parked once near Rotary Park and another time near the Botanic Garden. Both times we walked a few miles. The Rotary park area has a nice boardwalk. Fun to see the fly fishermen in the river. The Botanic Garden is very nice with a pond and washrooms. Nice variety of plants.  
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Nice and easy walking trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Walked from The Steamboat Grand hotel to the Yampa River (total round trip walk was about 2.5 miles) along this paved and partially shaded path. Nice and wide! Easy to walk, run, or bike! See picture for elevation changes and details of this part of the trail. "
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,This photo is the best part,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you were drawn to this by the photo someone added of the trees hanging over and shading the trail, then enjoy the photo. While the trail is nice and wide and easily shared by walkers, bikers, joggers and rollerbladers, most of it is not nearly so picturesque. The river is impressive in June with the snowmelt, true. And the vista across the river is pretty. I would not recommend it for a walk because it isn't a loop; it's a meandering trail. So when you want to go back to your car or whatever, you have to turn around and go back the way you came. That can get a little boring, and when the sun is beating down on you, it can get very hot."
Yampa River Core Trail,4.5,Nice wide trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail is great for walking or biking on.  It is all concrete and a lot of it runs along the Yampa River.  You do have to watch out for the biker though, most of them pay attention and warn you they are coming up behind you, but not all of them. Lots of nice scenery."
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,Cascade of falls which reveal themselves as you climb,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Cascade of falls which reveal themselves as you climb the stairs beside them. Careful when the ground is wet. You can see the lower falls without too much effort, though. Note that a portion of the trail is closed as of May 2021, so you can climb only so far and then have to go back down the same way."
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,Disappointed that trail was not open,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were so disappointed that the gorge trail was not open while we were in Ithaca.  Apparently the spring rains were damaging to parts of the gorge and they had to do some safety repairs and check to some areas.  The one thing I can say is that there is limited parking (only three spaces on the Triangle Park side)  in the area of the gorge.  We were able to park a short distance away in on street parking but always check before you leave your vehicle.  There are many permit only parking sections in Ithaca.
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,Most scenic route downtown to Cornell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If the weather is good and you have time, this is the best way to walk between Cornell and downtown Ithaca. Almost continuous waterfalls the whole way. Lots of stairs, so also a good workout going up. A little tricky to find. There are railings along all the steps, but it is not a good idea if it is rainy weather as the steps can get slippery."
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,How many towns have a 3/4 mile trail with 8 waterfalls running through them?,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I mean, it pretty much blows your mind, the amount of waterfalls in the area and right in town, the number on just a short stretch of creek.  We're used to hiking a couple of miles to see one single waterfall, not going less than a mile, right in town, no less, and seeing eight.  "
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,Falls Close to Downtown/College Area and Easilly Accessable,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Falls were just a short walk from street side parking. There was a lower falls are and an upper falls area. They were smaller most that we visited that day but the walk, trail and stair case were the easiest that we navigated on the day"
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,"Short, beautiful trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is absolutely beautiful. It's also super easy. We found parking easily on a Sunday late morning and did the whole loop (including east of College Ave) and explored Cornell's campus too. The portion of the trail east of College Ave doesn't have any falls, so if that's what you came for, you could skip that portion. You absolutely have to do this if you're in the Ithaca area."
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,Gorgeous!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is much less visited than some of the other gorge trails in the area, but it may have been our favorite on our 5-day stay in Ithaca. It's not a long trail, but you're constantly coming upon new waterfalls all along the walk. It's a narrow and steep climb up many, many steps, so those with mobility issues will unfortunately probably not make it very far."
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,Better late than never!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was so enjoyable, especially for the first time ...despite going to school at Cornell more than 45 years ago, I never had the time for this type of activity back then. It is quite beautiful, but not too taxing from a physical perspective.  There is ample room to rest at various spots, if you desire to let faster travelers pass you. However, if multiple long flights of steps (especially when going downhill) freak you out, this may not be an activity you will enjoy. Note -- there is always a handrail to steady yourself, if necessary. It took my wife and I about 2 hours to make the full roundtrip circuit, but we had parked about 1/2 mile away on campus, and that time also included stopping in the Ithaca Commons for coffee.  Highly recommended for anyone at any age, if walking isn't compromised."
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,Different views at every turn!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Such a gorgeous way to enjoy a hike (via stairs) and see a variety of waterfalls along the way. The landscape was ever changing as we continued through the gorge. Kids ages 4&7 easily walked through, we made it about half way before we ran out of time and had to head back down but wish we could have kept going! Highly recommend!"
Cascadilla Gorge Trail,4.5,awesome,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a terrific hike, starting at the Treman Triangle park in Ithaca. There is a gravel hiking path and many, many, steps next to the river, rising up a reported 400 feet. It comes out on the Cornell campus, and then continues on much flatter. There are several waterfalls along the way. It was totally awesome. If you like hiking and nature this will not disappoint. Just be sure you have good shoes for hiking, and bring a couple of water bottles, which you will need especially on a hot day. One problem is parking near the Treman Triangle park at the bottom. Seemed like all metered parking with a 2 hour limit. I think even if you are in great shape you would have trouble making it to the end of the trail and back in 2 hours. We turned around about halfway but would have loved to go the whole trail. We saw someone getting a parking ticket so they do enforce the 2 hour limit."
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,Fun hiking day!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Horsetooth Mountain is easily accessible by car. We drove up the mountain and hiked down. Ate our picnic lunch on a rock, put our feet in the lake (at the base of the mountain), built a rock tower and then hiked back up. I am 74 and my granddaughter (a freshman at Colorado State) enjoyed our hike. It was an “easy to medium”hike."
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,Horsetooth Mountain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is so pretty.  Take the drive. Just be careful where you stop because in some places you're expected to pay for use of the little beach areas, etc. Lovely brief drive. Wish there'd be more spots just for folks who wanted to make photos."
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,The Rangers are thieves,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"I purchased my fishing license, signed my fishing license, paid to register my boat, paid to register my trailer, paid for a parking pass for my truck, paid for a parking pass for my trailer (🙄), and obeyed what seemed like an endless number of “no wake” zones.  "
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,"Nice hikes, worth the climb up to the Horsetooth Mountain.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well maintained trails with lots to chose from. Flush toilets, water and picnic tables at base. Downside was we had to pay for parking but it was for 24 hour period. We went up to the falls and another day did a sunset hike up to Horsetooth Mountain. The view was spectacular at the top! "
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,Beautiful drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We drive the Horsetooth ever time we are in FoCo.  Love the view and the smells of nature.  We did hike down to the water once and fished but didn't stay long.  It was very busy that day.  Love the drive from the Damn to Watson Lake.  The sun sets are amazing and its looks so pretty when there is snow on the ground
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,Awesome views all around!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The reservoir is easy to access from Fort Collins. Wonderful views of the water on one side and the valley on the other. It’s a great way to feel like you’ve gotten away from the ordinary without a long drive. We loved it and look forward to spending more time there, especially to hike."
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,A warning to hikers and bikers,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I used to live on the West ridge of Horsetooth reservoir for many years so I speak from experience.
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,The hike to Horsetooth Falls is good with kids,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Horsetooth Falls trail is long enough to be a trip, but short enough that most kids over the age of 6 should be ok on it (and you won't have to carry them back).  The falls themselves are a bit small (in mid-summer, it's more like a bathroom shower than a waterfall) but if you can hit it after a storm in the spring time it can be pretty amazing.  But the hike itself is very pleasant and as you get near the end and start into the canyon, it's lovely."
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,Someone has to lower entrance fee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Much for scenery, a throng of people always gathered despite the high entrance fee. I guess the charm of the place is still there."
Horsetooth Mountain Open Space,4.5,Breathtaking!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The drive up the mountain overlooking the city of Fort Collins is spectacular. Being one with nature is almost spiritual. Cleanses the mind and soul.  Add a little music and you'll be in heaven.  
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Small boardwalk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a rather small boardwalk and walking the whole boardwalk shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. There's some gift shops and restaurants as well as some hotels. The beach is accessible from the entire boardwalk. The walking area is quite narrow. There aren't any rides or games and the area appears to be residential with a few shops near the parking area. However parking can be hard to find. I visited in October and had to park several blocks away. Great place to visit but not something that's going to take a whole day.
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Charming wooden boardwalk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lots of shopping for all even in the off season. Easy pre paid parking just use a credit card and set a timer to come back in time. Plenty of benches to rest on.
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Nice DE Boardwalk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This was our first trip to Bethany Beach as we used to always go to Ocean City.   This boardwalk is smaller but very pretty and lots of fun.  Lots of places to shop and eat and even though we didn't go they offer music on Thursday nights in the summer
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Had a little time before lunch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,so we walked the boardwalk and the shops along the parking area.  Surprised how many of the shops were active considering all the closures back home and in other vacation destinations.  Salt air and rolling waves and food and shopping is always a great combination
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Off Season is SLOW,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived on 9/8/20...one day after Labor Day.  The Boardwalk was pretty quiet.  A couple of restaurants were closed for the season or had diminished hours.  There were lots of sales on clothing/suits, but nothing my gang really wanted.  "
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Nice Beachside Strolling,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked along the boardwalk and visited a few stores on a recent visit. It was excruciatingly cold with biting wind, thus we were all wearing our winter coats! I can only imagine the boardwalk and stores are really crowded in the summer. It was very busy when we visited, cold weather be darned. It’s a nice clean boardwalk, with a good selection of eateries. The beach is quite nice, but the cold wind eventually drove us away. The town allows dogs on the beach and boardwalk until May, so there were many pups, impervious to the cold, frolicking with their people on the beach and boardwalk. Parking lot was filled and I imagine it’s kind of a nightmare in the summer. Still, very nice beach and boardwalk."
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Beware of Delaware,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Bethany beach has very limited parking to access the beach. One cannot get within miles unless you live there. Very expensive to pay for parking if you manage to find a spot 3 blocks away. Only one street allows for the public. Five spots reserved for handicapped to accommodate a 38 mile beach. Delaware sucks in providing beaches for the public. Go to Maryland where all people have access.
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Nice beach but way too crowded,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Never go on Labor Day weekend! It was way too crowded, got there at noon and literally spent like 20 min trying to find parking, which they dont have any big parking lots smh u have to just try and find spots along the street or little lots, it is a cpl dollars per hour. Ppl were crammed on the beach like sardines, when looking down at the beach you couldn't even see sand just polka dot of umbrellas on every inch.😩 It was our first time so I'm not sure if this is how it is every weekend in the summer or  just bc it was labor day wknd. The beach itself was actually surprisingly really nice, sand was nice and water was blue and pretty clear not like the beaches in MD where u can't see the bottom but waves were way too rough for my 3 yr old to get in so ended up being a wasted 3 hr drive. There's public bathrooms, but no changing station, and only outside showers to wash off sand. It's a super cute beach town with a nice boardwalk full of cute shops and food stops. But super expensive $18 for just a 4 chicken strip basket😱. On top of it all there was this really rude family that didn't want us to sit in front of them bc we wud ""block their view"" news flash rude family its a public beach and u picked the wrong day to be stingy with space that isn't even yours, next time put your things down in front of u if you want to be stingy and don't want ppl to sit there. "
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Family vacation,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family and friends have been going to Bethany Beach for years and we love it. It has a small town feeling, with a wonderful July 4th parade, concerts in the evening, ice cream shops, candy shops, clothing stores, restaurants, and a short boardwalk--with no games or rides (which keeps it simple and relaxing.) Over the years, the beach has gotten much smaller since they built up the dunes for protection from the storms, and this also limits the view from the boardwalk, but it was important to do. We will keep coming back as long as it maintains its family friendly atmosphere."
Bethany Beach Boardwalk,4.5,Nice Small Town Boardwalk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well maintained and nicely traveled boardwalk.  Near downtown there a number of shops, residences and dining establishments.  Easy access to the beach to see the surf and sand.  Depending upon the time of year parking can be challenging.  I enjoy boardwalks wherever I go and this one was nice."
Tunnel Drive,4.5,Spectacular hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited on a sunny afternoon in early March. Spotted 3 bighorn sheep, a sleeping skunk, and lots of cool cactuses. Plus: cool tunnels, beautiful views along the river, kids had fun climbing rocks and looking for wildlife. Never a dull moment. (We honestly enjoyed it more than the visit to Royal Gorge we'd made that morning, and this didn't cost a cent!)"
Tunnel Drive,4.5,Beautiful Walk by the Arkansas River,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I gave this a 5, because the hike/walk is worth it for my health and it got my husband moving!  We did our walk around 10:00 a.m. and we felt the heat.  We had plenty of water, a hat, tennis shoes and our Fitpro to check our steps (distance).  The Arkansas River, the peacefulness and beautiful scenery made the walk worth every step.  We took lots of pictures, sat at most the benches for 1 1/2 mile walk (2 miles original).  We loved the bridge walkway, the tunnels, especially the dark tunnel (very cool during the heat), we waved at the riders on the  the 9:15 a.m. train coming back through.  This is a must see and do for the adventure."
Tunnel Drive,4.5,Fantastic family friendly trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We got our morning wiggles out by walking the 4 mile total length. Wide trail and well maintained. Incline at the beginning but the rest is flat. Went through 3 short tunnels at the beginning of the trail. My boys loved throwing rocks in the river. Climbing the rocks and waving at the people on the train and on the rafts. 
Tunnel Drive,4.5,Hidden Gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This one is not on the main path, look for this one for sure and don't miss it.   A short (but steep) hike and the views and experience is well worth it.  We found it late one day and loved it so much we went back early the next day to walk it all."
Tunnel Drive,4.5,Cool hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's not too far to get to the tunnels, which you walk through on this hike and the path continue quite a ways beyond.  It is a wide path that doesn't involve scrambling over any rocks.  Past the tunnels, you look down on the Arkansas River. We saw the Royal Gorge train go by in the valley and watched the white water rafters return from rafting through the Royal Gorge.  There were a few resting spots along the way. We enjoyed the rafts go by so much that we booked a white water rafting trip, based on what we saw on this hike."
Tunnel Drive,4.5,"""Easy"" trail with lots to explore ",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Visited with 2 adults and 1 child age 12. Weather was gorgeous, we got lucky. The trail is said to be ""easy"" and overall is... that 1st incline was harder for me, someone who is out of shape and not from Colorado. After  that though it was good, nice trail to walk and we took an easy pace. Saw the 3  tunnels and at about 3/4 mile we turned around. It was very cool to see in person. Free. There was a lot of dog poop every where...shame. There is an outhouse at the start of the trail. "
Tunnel Drive,4.5,Beautiful and Peaceful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As the other reviews stated, there’s a climb at the beginning but it’s short and worth the effort. Once the trail flattens out, you soon hit the tunnels which provide a beautiful photo backdrop. One tunnel is very dark so be aware. "
Tunnel Drive,4.5,Easy and peaceful way to end the afternoon.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy and quick hike. Like others said, small incline at the beginning but then it levels out. The first two tunnels aren't that spectacular, but the view of the river is great and peaceful. Don't turn back after the first two tunnels because the 3rd tunnel is the best - it is dark but is pretty cool to walk through. At the end of this tunnel is another great view. You can make this hike as long or as short as you want, the trail continues past the tunnels for a few miles."
Tunnel Drive,4.5,A different sort of trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very different sort of trail.  No charge.  You can go as far as you want at your own pace.  the trail is very smooth, wide, and easy.  I just wish there was more information along the way to explain the history and geological formations."
Tunnel Drive,4.5,"Outstanding scenery, great walk for all levels of walkers",5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best walking trail in the area.  I took my dog on this jaunt and loved it.  It can feel very remote once you get past the tunnels so be warned if you don't like that.  The scenery is outstanding!  Other than the first few hundred feet it's a very easy walk for all levels of walkers.  The only challenge is parking but there is a giant shade tree diagonally across the parking area where you can park as well.  There was a school track meet or something going on when I got there so that's where I had to park.  Pit toilets at entrance in case you need them but I didn't use them.
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,Beautiful day on the glacier!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This gem is about an hour's drive from Anchorage and on a gorgeous sunny day in March was an amazing hike.  Views were unreal and the hike was moderately strenuous. The ice cave was unfortunately covered, so we didn't get to see it.  Unsolicited advice: snowshoes highly recommended, bring plenty of water, and a shovel for emergencies. Highly recommended."
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,Hidden Gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Can't say enough about this place... a very short/flat hike in with some amazing views along the way. We took a short path off the trail to a river (see pic) with a great view of the mountain. The views are 360 around... can be a very short/quick trip that is well worth the time!
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,Do not miss this awesome experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a must see. The hike to the glacier is about 3 mile round trip and worth every step. It is relatively easy on well marked trail. The reward at the end is an open tundra leading to an ice cave, which is totally awesome."
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,A phenomenal experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I travel a lot and I love to explore. I’ve seen many amazing things and this trail (and glacier) are I think literally the most amazing things I’ve ever seen/experienced. 
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,Beautiful glacier and a river flowing through an ice cave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I highly recommend the Byron Glacier trail! This is a short, easy trail with a beautiful river flowing through an ice cave and an amazing glacier. We were able to walk on the glacier which was really cool. We spent about 1.5 hours here on our way back to Anchorage from Whittier."
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,Amazing Trail (Easy - Family Friendly),5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing trail.  You can walk about 1.5 miles to see glacier.  We all actually walked-up in the glacier for about half way to the top and had lots of fun.  Very easy trail and can be done with young children.  
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,fun stop on our driving route,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great little Glacier trail easy to get to and quick hike.  It was a gorgeous day so we couldn't resist a stop.  Direct path, pleasant people along the trail and lots of stops for lovely picturesque scenery.  We didn't hike up the snow field, but lots of people were up there. We weren't comfortable without proper footwear."
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,Touch and feel glacier ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing hike to the glacier. You can actually access it and touch the ice which makes it so unique. Its a hike with awesome views and a picture shot at every corner. Its about a one hour hike total time. Wear sturdy boots and dress warm. There is a river that runs along the way. The glacier has a little cave formed. There is pebble and rocks near the glacier and you can see waterfalls. Its incredibly beautiful. There is plenty of parking at the trail head.
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,Stunning Scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the trail with three small children and strollers.  It was a bit foggy when we started, but the sun shining through made for beautiful pictures.  The children loved the glacier.  About a two mile hike round trip, not a difficult hike."
Byron Glacier Trail,4.5,Great Day Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our group of 6 hike to the glacier. The snow along the trail was a little soft and we had to step in the footprints of the previous group, but it was totally worth it. The hike out there and back was beautiful, it took about two hours round trip. "
Katy Trail,4.5,New to Dallas,1.0 of 5 bubbles,So disappointed that there are no public restrooms. I just moved to Dallas. I am a hiker/avid Walker and cannot use any of the trails as there are no public restrooms. I found Katy trail yesterday and could not walk it as I could not find a restroom therefore I had to turn back. 
Katy Trail,4.5,Work off the jet lag or business meals,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is my go to place after a flight into DFW or a few days working in town (or eating high calorie USA meals).  It's a path full of locals walking, talking, jogging, roller-blading and even cycling through a central Dallas location.  An easy as you like 5km up and back trail central(ish) to downtown."
Katy Trail,4.5,Katy Trail Rocks,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Katy Trail really helps to make Dallas a great city.  It is pretty busy, with a wide variety of people (and dogs) walking and running and riding and skating.  Very popular.  Mostly shaded.  Native plants.  Bag dispensers for dogs.  It follows what was the track of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, a/k/a the Katy."
Katy Trail,4.5,Awesome rail trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great pedestrian path through really cool Dallas neighborhoods. Wide paved path that is also quite surprisingly shady. Popular for walking, jogging, bikes and roller blades. Apartment buildings spill out onto the trail as well as eateries. Definitely check it out."
Katy Trail,4.5,"Great 3 mile trail to run, walk or bike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a little gem in downtown Dallas.  I had a great 18k (12 mile) run starting and ending at City Hall.  
Katy Trail,4.5,"Good, Urban Trail",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great paved, multi-&-single use 3 plus mile trail running through & past downtown Dallas. Clean, great plantings alongside, good signage, one path for just walkers, other, wider path for bikers, walkers, runners, pets, et al. Multiple entrances, both legit & carved out. There are a few stop-off places to drink & dine (although they are expensive by virtue of their convenience). It is busy almost any time of day, any time of year. Thankful to have this."
Katy Trail,4.5,Unexpected tourist gem! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I was visiting Dallas after 30 years since my last trip and was really positively surprised by some of the changes. 
Katy Trail,4.5,Busy pedestrian/biking trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice trail in the Turtle Creek / Oak Lawn area -- nicely paved and divided.  Great for walkers, runners, and bicyclists.  Plenty of people using it so I felt completely safe.  Saw plenty of dog walkers as well."
Katy Trail,4.5,GREAT running and walking venue,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We lived in Dallas for 20+ years, part of it right on the Katy trail. This is a well maintained, popular trail for humans and dogs.  There are occasional problems with people riding bikes too fast and skaters, but all in all very nice."
Katy Trail,4.5,Do explore this trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful trail with great shade and beautiful off trails. Love the fact that they have  concrete and walking trail separate. There are multiple starting points and majority trails has shaded area. Ton of walkers and dog walkers who really keep the trail clean.
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,Loved The Cardio!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The 5 mile hike to the waterfall was a beautiful way to spend a sunny Autumn afternoon! The trail is rated as moderate, so brink a good pair of walking or hiking shoes. The waterfall at the end is beautiful. There are restrooms at the trail’s entrance. Be aware the roads getting in and out of the trail become congested and take some time to navigate."
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,New trail improvements make a huge difference,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Thank you GSMNP & Friends of the Smokies, for the recent improvements to this trail. "
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,Favorite hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was my favorite hike on our visit to GSMNP. The hike is a bit rocky in places, so watch your footing. The falls were very pretty. We got an early start, so it wasn’t too busy. The lot is located on Cades Cove drive. There were few cars when we arrived, but the lot was overflowing when we left. There are pit toilets at the trailhead. Most of the hike is wooded, so we were shaded from the sun. "
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,Average hike,2.0 of 5 bubbles,I wasn't impressed with this hike to the falls. I will admit we were a tad under prepared but never the less I didn't think the falls were worth the strenuous hike. The water was better at some of the open points along the path than the final falls. The path was well cleared but I wish there were more scenic parts cleared to show the little rapids. This would have allowed for better break and view points. I wouldn't recommend this for families. Also make sure you have a good amount of water and protein sources.
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,Fantastic View,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We took a hike up the mountain to the falls.  It was so pretty.  The falls and rippling water all the way up.  So peaceful.  Puts you next to nature.  Had a picnic lunch after the hike to refuel..A great place to visit.
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,Abram Falls was gorgeous,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had no clue we were going to hike so we were very unprepared. Me, my husband and our 2 daughters age 5 and 7 made the hike in 2.5 hours. We didnt stop much and kept a great pace. We got some beautiful picures from it. This is a must if ur at cades cove."
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,Great view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail was advanced, although I have asthma and my husband and my friend are over 60 I'm over 50. I timed the walk there and it was an hour We stopped and took pictures spent a little time at the falls and then an hour back. It is very steep wet tennis shoes were sufficient but bring pretty of water, bring toilet paper (lol) and snacks. The views were well worth it and the quality time with family was the best. I would say anyone can do this just be prepared for at least an hour to an hour and a half in and back."
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,Amazing Scenery and  a Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We make it a point to do this hike every time we visit the area. The trail is very well maintained and an easy hike - if one is in decent shape. One is rewarded with amazing views - especially at the crest, which is my son's favorite photo spot. The falls are nothing short of spectacular. The water was a bit cold but  we enjoyed a nice dip after the warm hike to the falls. A definite must for anyone who loves hiking and water falls"
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,A Waterfall Worth Seeing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This waterfall was worth seeing.  You can find the trail in Cades Cove.  As I wrote in my Cades Cove review, I recommend going early.  I debated whether or not to finish Cades Cove first or doing the hike to Abrams Falls.  I did the latter first and I am glad that I did.  I had the waterfalls to myself.  In fact, I did not see anyone until my walk back to my car and the parking lot was almost filled.  It is a moderate hike and requires walking uphill a few times, but it is nothing strenuous.  I thought Abrams Waterfall was worth the hike."
Abrams Falls Trail,4.5,Great trail with awesome ending,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Trail is 2.5 miles one way. There is no restroom available and I would bring plenty of water and snacks. Trail is moderate with its fair share of elevation changes. I would bring a swimsuit to swim in the falls area, and there is plenty of places to wander off the trail and swim along the way.I would bring water shoes for swimming as some of he rocks are slick and or sharp."
Bubble Rock,4.5,Coming back to the old friend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"On a sunny morning we drove to the Bubbles trailhead parking to do our favorite hike combo: Bubble Rock, South Bubble, North Bubble. To our pleasant surprise, the rocks were completely dry and there was hardly any trace of the yesterday’s rain. We had done this hike countless times in the past and hiking it again was like meeting an old friend after years of separation. I cannot describe the views properly, so I will post my pictures and you will see the Acadia magic yourselves. The ocean, the islands, the mountains, the woods, Jordan Pond were in their full spring glory on a bright warm and sunny day. "
Bubble Rock,4.5,Really nice hike with awesome view hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very easy hike. We went to south bubble rock first. The view on Jordan Pond was spectacular even on a foggy day. After that we decided to try north bubble hike. It was more difficult but too crazy. If you go there don’t go back. Keep going on the trail. You going to get to the cliffs with a view on Eagle Lake. We went about one mile and came back. We had really good time.
Bubble Rock,4.5,Glacial Erratic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked up to the Bubbles from Jordan Pond Path with our dog.  The Bubbles Trail leads from Jordan Pond Path at the northeast end of the lake to South Bubble and then North Bubble.  The section between Jordan Pond and South Bubble has a few difficult sections, especially for a dog.  Alex had quite a bit of trouble at the Fat Man's Squeeze, but eventually got up.  He was very proud of himself for getting up to the top.  Bubbles Divide Trail is an easier route to access the Bubbles.  Bubble Rock, a glacial erratic that seems to be balanced on a cliff edge is near the summit of South Bubble.  Both mountains have views towards Jordan Pond from above.  Overall, a great hike, but keep in mind the route for Jordan Path is difficult."
Bubble Rock,4.5,"For new hikers, stick to Bubbles Divide or the parking lot",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are a few trails that lead to Bubble Rock. Despite having a map, we accidentally took our dogs up a very rocky/steep one and when we finally got to the top, there was a ladder rung that we could not get past. So we hiked all the way back down and took Bubbles Divide instead (still challenging but doable). If you are a novice hiker or have young kids, I would definitely recommend starting at the Bubbles parking lot for an even gentler hike."
Bubble Rock,4.5,North Bubble and South Bubble VIEW - but the rock...who cares....,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked up to south bubble and saw the large boulder. I was unimpressed.  However, as you continue past the rock to the overlook it was a great view of Jordan Pond.  North Bubble had an even better view and less people - don't skip it!"
Bubble Rock,4.5,South Bubble trail is easier ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got to the Bubble rock parking around 830am and got the last parking lot on a Thursday . We did the South Bubble trail which is easier as I read from Pinterest blogs and did the same trail to return to the parking. The Bubble rock is unique and wondering how this gigantic Boulder just sit there 🤔 . After further hiking,  it reached the South Bubble trail summit with the marvelous Jordan pond view. We saw hikers came up from the Jordan pond and learned that there is more rock scrambling from the other Bubble trail. We told them the South Bubble is easier and they were relieved and glad to hike down from there😊."
Bubble Rock,4.5,"South Bubble, Bubble Rock and North Bubble",5.0 of 5 bubbles,My husband and I hiked to all the “Bubbles”today in the afternoon. For the umpteenth time… we never get tired of the sweeping vistas from the summits. 
Bubble Rock,4.5,Love the Bubbles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The rock is cool to see, but hiking both the South and especially the North Bubble are some of the best hikes in the park.   Stunning views, moderately challenging terrain.  Do it early - the parking lot is small and is full by 8am;  and you don’t want to be there with huge crowds"
Bubble Rock,4.5,One Hike First Timer Should Make Even for Those with Vertigo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I believe the round trip is about 1.5 miles from the parking lot to and from Bubble Rock.  The real problem with Bubble trails - both North and South - is the parking lot.  Not many parking spaces at the trail head on the Park Loop Road at any time.  There are plenty of parking spaces around Jordan Pond, but if you start your hike from there, it would be a longer hike.  It is lovely around the Jordan Pond trail then hiking up to the Bubble Rock. If you're not pressured for time, I recommend this route.  Bubble Rock should be the first hike up for the first time visitors.  Even if you have a fear of heights, this trail would be fine.  We're casual hikers and we thoroughly enjoyed the hike."
Bubble Rock,4.5,Great hike and views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this as part of a loop hike.  We started at Jordan Pond House, hiked across the Jordan Cliffs Trail, then down to the Jordan Pond Path, then up one side of Bubble to Balance Rock, down the other side, then a nice easy walk on the Jordan Pond Path back to the start - about 5 miles and less than 4 hours.  It was our favorite hike in the park.   There are great views on top of Bubble and the balance rock is definitely neat to see.  The hike up is steep either side, but not too long; it is a bit of a boulder field, so it's uneven and slow.  One side involves some hand rungs and pulling yourself up, but nothing difficult."
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,Not worth the drive if you are a hiker.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was highly recommended to me but it fell short of expectations. One of the trails was closed during our visit because of ""bear activity and salmon spawning"".  We did not get to see any animals, and saw just one salmon swimming alone. I think this would be a good place to visit if you are older and not able to hike other trails, or if you have young kids who are not able to handle longer hikes. For us it was a short visit, there is a short loop trail with 2 viewpoints. Nice views but not worth the extra drive. I would only recommend it as an activity of older visitors or visitors with  young kids."
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,Gorgeous Hiking with Well Marked Trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although the Nature Center is closed due to COVID-19, we went here to do a self guided hike.  We planned on doing the Albert Loop, but it was closed because the salmon spawning brought a large influx of bear."
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,Nice for a variety of hike options.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice little nature center building and shop. Indoor clean bathrooms. Beautiful view right out of the door. We took the short Rodak trail hike and all ages handled it easily from young kids in the group ahead, to our group of teens, parents and grandparents. It's a well-kept gravel trail that has more difficult and lengthy options available as well."
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,"Nice Views, Bring Bug Spray",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We ended up there after the center was closed, but the trails are open 24/7 (although hiking at night is not recommended for safety). We liked the short, Rodak Nature Loop Trail, but the Albert Loop Trail was a bit monotonous through the forest, with lots of flies and mosquitos swarming around."
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,3 Mike loop was OK and easy but mainly forested,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The nature centre was closed when we visited. However, there are maps available outside in a little flip top plastic container. You are expected to pay a 5 USD usage fee. "
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,Great Day Hike Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The nature center serves as a gateway to the Chugach State Park, which is the third-largest state park in the United States. The center log cabin (mile-12) has access to many self guided hiking trails. The interpretive displays inside the center showed the original log cabin was a popular bar known as the Paradise Haven Lodge. The nature center offers a variety of activities and programs for visitors of all ages, including hiking, wildlife viewing, educational exhibits, and guided nature walks. It is an excellent destination for nature enthusiasts, hikers, and those interested in learning about the local flora, fauna, and the natural history of the area. The friendly and knowledgeable staff shared with us trail maps and wildlife information."
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,Interesting small nature center with trails,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We stopped by on our way from Denali to Anchorage.  We needed a little leg stretcher so stopped to walk a short trail.  We were warned of a mama black bear and cub in the area.  Two other people concerned about the bear joined us for the walk.  Safety in numbers!  We didn't see the bear but enjoyed our walk
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,Serenity,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great place to explore. The trails range from simply walking out to the observation decks, a few miles, or doing the entirety of the Crow Pass Trail (23.1 miles one way). There are both brown and black bears here so ensure you have bear spray. I did the hike to the yurts and river access. The topography switches from dense aspen groves to high-like elevation small conifers. Will definitely do this area again. "
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,Saw salmon spawning there. Was muddy conditions.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wish I could return there in better conditions. This is where the Chugach hikes begin. We took a  short walk to see the beaver pond and the salmon viewing boardwalk. One trail was closed for Bear activity, but seemed to be an annual closure. Other trails were apparently flooded and muddy."
Eagle River Nature Center,4.5,Trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We stopped in to hike and were greeted by friendly staff. The little visitors center has a lot packed into a small place. There are different furs and animal artifacts that are touchable as well as other useful information. There are comfortable chairs to just rest in the warm building for a while. The bathrooms were large and clean. They offered helpful advice an which trails would meet our needs. The trails were groomed and although the snow packed trail had about 2 ft of snow it was easily navigated. The views are spectacular!!
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,lots of animals,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We liked seeing all the animals and displays inside the nature center. Of note, they have an aquarium that kids can walk/crawl underneath. We also liked seeing the massive collection of active bees and the live birds. They even have a fort-like reading area. If we had had more time, we would have considered doing some of the trails, but the inside has quite a lot of stuff to entertain, and it's free too!"
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,Rochester’s best spot,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What an absolutely amazing place.  We attended a bird banding class.  We went to a festival.  We walked the trails.  We rock climbed.  We explored a cave.  We paddled in a canoe.  We came multiple times during our month in Rochester.  If we lived here, we’d come all the time.  This place is fun, interesting, and educational for all ages."
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,Nice Walking Place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Quiet, beautiful place to walk or hike with paved and natural trails. We were in Rochester Minnesota  for an appointment at the Mayo Clinic and wanted to get sway from the hustle and needles for awhile so took a really nice walk here. I recommend it highly for hikers or walkers.  There are some really neat things to see while hiking the trails."
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,Needed a break and we found Quarry Hill. It was a wonderful respite.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great for a family day out. The trails are easy to walk and are well marked. The activities were fun and educational. My 13 year old son loved the nature center. It is really well done. This is a great place to leave your stress and chill. The nature center and  some trails are wheelchair accessible.
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,Wonderful Experienc,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"No matter the season, a visit to Quarry Hill is well worth the time.  Family or solo, it's a great place to connect with nature. I/we particularly enjoy walking the trails and soaking in the sights and sounds of the outdoors."
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,"Relaxing, beautiful and Edicational",5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were in Rochester for a couple of Mayo visits. My husband and I like to find quiet park spaces where he can nap in the shade while I read poetry and journal! Mission accomplished here! We set up “camp” in the old state hospital cemetery. It was down in a valley with a great breeze and some large shade trees. A reflective quiet space. 
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,Quiet at west entrance,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a great short walk with the family. We entered via the west entrance and did not see the center. The first part is paved, then gravel, then cleared paths. Liked the green of the forest! Saw dragonflies and a black butterfly"
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,"Great place over and over, but twice now",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I don’t even know how to mention this; don’t even want to mention this, but I will because this is the number 1 family destination in Rochester.  I first must laud the place.  Hiking, summer programs, exploration, truly a family friendly place.  This spring, in February, and then on Tuesday (June 4, 2019) and Lord, I wish I would have said something in February, but I thought it was an isolated incident.  But when we came across it again, I had to write about it.  AND I will be writing the staff about this.  On Tuesday early afternoon before the storm, we hiked up one of the off paths and came across two men.  One of them was performing and act on another man.  And that is the same thing we saw in February (but different people).  Best place in Rochester to do family stuff, but twice now, my wife and I have seen this as we have been on some of the off-paths.  I wonder if others have seen this too.  There has got to be some kind of up-tick in monitoring.  What if a family came across this?"
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,A Lifetime of Great Experiences,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been visiting Quarry Hill Nature Center for my entire life.  It is a true gem in Rochester.  The nature center includes many native MN species, classroom and meeting space.  The staff is knowledgeable and kind and strive to educate anyone who walks through the door.  There are a variety of unique ecosystems located in the park including; the lake, the quarry filled with fossils, an oak savannah, butterfly garden, picnic areas, paved trails and snowshoe and cc ski trails in the winter.  QHNC is a beautiful, peaceful place to visit."
Quarry Hill Nature Center,4.5,Surprising Good Nature in the City Limits,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"They have kept this little nature center going for years by improving it and expanding and providing classes, activities and education to the community.  It's not big like a zoo.  If you are going just to see a few turtles, fish, birds and bee hives you will not be disappointed.  It is worth the visit inside but the outside is what is great.  Trails, paved or not, a climbing wall (rugged), a decent pond and a few docks to walk or fish on.  You can get out of it what you want.  You can sit and relax or hike/walk, nature adventure.  Any classes are terrific and the birthday parties are great too."
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Hiking trails,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trails need to be marked with names and miles. None of the trail heads have maps! The boardwalk trail in the woods was the best (near the kayak launch) but it is not marked either. The nature center is closed permanently, why is that?"
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Serene,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful area with hiking paths and nature identifiers.  Great tower overlook.  The office is open short hours (there are nature displays and rest rooms there), but the trails have longer hours.  Highly recommend."
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Fun little trek!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Keep an eye out for the turn into the parking area. There is a small sign but it’s easy to miss. There is a fair amount of parking available, and it’s mostly shady. We took the Pine Beach Trail. It was a nice little walk/hike out to a private beach. There is a lookout over Gator Lake and Little Lagoon. There is also a porta potty about halfway that is well cared for; i.e., it was clean, didn’t stink and had toilet paper! It’s mostly a flat, easy hike until about the last ¼ mile to the beach where you walk through sand and between dunes. There is a bench strategically placed just before the sand part so you can take off/put on your shoes.  It was fun! We didn’t see much wildlife other than a heron and seagulls. Recommend this for a relaxing trek out in nature!"
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Pine Beach Trail Enjoyment,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Our family visits  the area every year in early spring and the Pine Beach Trail is one of the trails we hike routinely. 
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Beautiful walk with no bikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice park. We walked the trail/path to the lake, climbed the stairs up to the observation deck and then on to the beach. "
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Birdwatching and Animals OH MY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Went to the visitors center first and was directed to go a on multiple trails to see the local wildlife.  Was a little hot going on the trails but well worth it for the family.  Highly recommended!
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Beautiful area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited the wildlife refuge on a recent trip to the area.  Its a beautiful area.  We hiked the Jeff Friend trail, which is very easy and maybe a mile or so for the loop.  Lovely scenery and sub tropical forest.  We'd like to visit again when we have more time to see more of the park."
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,What a great spot!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This place is great...so beautiful, quiet, and relaxing. I hiked most of the trails, did some bird watching, jumped in the Gulf...what a great day! I documented my adventure and posted it on YouTube. You can find it by searching for Nash Potatoes Outdoor Show."
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Bring bug spray. We were just there this past week and the mosquitos were so bad. It is a gorgeous place and we were so sad we had to leave after only walking a short distance because we forgot bug spray. My kiddos loved all the small frogs hopping along the path. This is a must do when in Gulf Shores.
Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge,4.5,Enjoyable hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stopped on your way back from Fort Morgan. It was a fold windy day.   We owere looking for a place to hike out of the wind.  Pine beach trail was just the ticket.  Walked 1 1⁄4 miles until the sand trails started turned around and walked back. Nice easy trail. Saw several heron, one even talked to us.  Look for little.paths off the trail, one by bench to get closer to marsh area, also by tower, to beach area. Saw the her on in those spots.  Look closely as the her on blend in to the landscape.  Plan to go back and Chechen out the Jeff Friend section of the refuge."
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,Wonderful and relatively mild walk if the temperatures are in good time of year,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So i started the trail from the Hoover Dam Lodge where i stayed.  The trail down and up from the Railroad trail  is a bit steep but once you traverse this short piece of trail real estate the rest of your journey is reasonably flat and once at the Hoover Dam you can choose stairs or an elevator down to the dam level and come out at the gift shop snack area   below the Dam parking lot.     The trail itself   is wonderful the five tunnels are fascinating and make anyone's pictures look good lol   I did not see any bats on this day nor thankfully rattlesnakes as other reviewers have mentioned but then temperatures had gotten a bit cooler by early November as well so maybe less reason for them to be hanging out in the tunnels during the day.  In any case the tunnels make the first part (which will also be your last part) of the round trip go fast.  The trail from where the Dam area technically begins is not part of the railroad trail and has a couple options at one point one of which claims to be a ""shortcut"" but is really not much difference in time to walk.   Also keep an eye out for the offshoot to walk over to and up on the Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Bridge.... super windy up there as it was in morning on other parts of the trail so make sure you got a hat that stays on or don't wear it lol       But the bridge walk has some cool views as well.   Overall a great walk i think was at least 10 miles overall but not bad."
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,Loved this Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This 8 mile trail is a moderate to easy one.  It has excellent scenery overall and a constant view of Lake Mead.  
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,Great hike with amazing views sprinkled with history from a great era in American history!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Historical railroad trail let’s you get away from the hustle of Vegas and offers a great trek to hike, bike or walk with amazing views and landscapes.  The hike is super easy, more of a walking path opposed to a hiking trail but offers a good distance with plenty of historical markers, observation areas and benches to stop at and take in all the natural beauty of Lake Mead!  This is definitely family friendly and a great spot to bike.  Highly recommend it for a short day trip, running path or just an excuse to get off “the strip” for a bit.  Lots of photo opportunities as well.  Very close to Hoover Dam!"
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,Great hike for cooler weather,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went in the late fall and the weather varied between perfect and very cool (in the shadier parts). It's interesting to see the old railroad tunnels but there aren't any tracks left. If you keep hiking you can go all the way to Hoover Dam, which we did. Great views of Lake Mead and plenty of benches to sit and relax along the way. "
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,Great afternoon walk and adventure ..,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My oldest granddaughter & I love to hike with our pups; this trail is more of a long walk than a hike, but is well worth it.  The trail is very well maintained and, leaving from the Lake Mead trailhead, is only a slight incline.  As usual, we took our husky's and noticed several other people brought theirs as well.  This is a very popular trail and we crossed paths with many people, ranging from young families with children in strollers to elderly couples to people jogging and on bikes.  The views and tunnels are amazing and there is a small rest area after the 5th tunnel where we stopped and had a nice picnic lunch."
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,Interesting but neglected,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"It ends/begins on the top floor of the parking garage at the Hoover Dam.  There was hardly any signage so we pretty much found it by accident and only because we knew it was there somewhere and were looking for it!  the signs along the trails were very worn and not legible in places.  It's a shame that it isn't maintained.  Bikes aren't allowed in so if people rode over, there should be a safe place for them to leave bikes inside so they could tour the dam.  We walked out from the dam and was hoping to see some of the tunnels and views but ran out of time.  A trail map with distances would be helpful.  I was glad I got to see some of it but there wasn't enough information on this end to explain what we were walking on."
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,View of Lake Mead,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this walk at sunset. I enjoyed this much better than a late morning/early afternoon walk. The sunset colors looked great with Lake Mead in the background. Bring a flashlight if you go at sunset as well as it gets dark in the 5 tunnels. Plus, you can use it to see bats. We saw a couple flying around. Most were out feeding. The trail is pretty smooth. It’s an in-and-out trail. We parked at the Hoover Dam Lodge as there is a trailhead there. They have clean restrooms and places to eat after your walk. It’s a huge parking lot."
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,Love It,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This really is a lovely walk, we always walk to the Hoover Dam have lunch and walk back. Great views of Lake Mead, we were lucky to see the Mountain goats on a stroll. Would recommend if you like walking."
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,Great way to spend an afternoon,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We ""hiked"" this trail.  Not much of a hike in terms of effort.  No real elevation gain, and the trail for the most part was just a smooth gravel path.  It was 3.7 miles each way from the trailhead, which is a parking lot near the Alan Bible National Park Visitor Center.  The trail ends at the Hoover Dam.  Round trip was about 4 hours, including about a 1/2 hour stop at the Dam.  Very relaxing.  "
Historic Railroad Trail,4.5,My favorite place for a day hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I used to hike back in here a long time ago when it wasn't open to the public and we'd have to hide from the ranger!  But now that it is public I go quite often.  It is scenic and historic.  It is not strenuous and I an take the kids or elderly folk here.  The tunnels are interesting and quite unique to this area.  
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Hickman Bridge Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Our family loved hiking the Hickman Bridge Trail in Capital Reef National Park. The parking lot was very busy and we were lucky to get a spot. There is street parking in the area as well. This 1.8 mile round trip trail starts off in a very scenic spot with rock walls built along the river. There is an almost immediate elevation gain but after that initial push it gets easier. Depending on the time of day there are some shaded spots and the varied terrain keeps it interesting. It was fun to walk under and around the bridge. We didn’t have time for much but this trail fit into our trip perfectly.
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Get there early.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Couldn’t find parking at the trailhead parking lot in the am so I went back @ 7:00pm after visiting the park.   There was only one auto in the parking lot then.  I hiked a little but didn’t have the daylight left to do a full hike.   I went a little way then traversed the river.  What a great place to visit.  My lower river walk came across a beaver slide and a few downed trees.  A must see, next time."
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Beautiful hike!  The Natural Bridge is Stunning and I did it with a newly injured knee.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a moderate 1.8 mile round trip hike with a 400 foot elevation change.  The hike itself was a gorgeous trek up the side of a mountain.  Rocky up and down parts and sandy parts.  This week we have learned that almost anyone can to a moderate hike if you take your time, rest often, wear proper footwear and use hiking sticks if needed.  I had just twisted my knee three days prior on earlier hike and had mild swelling and a moderate limp.  We decided to try the Hickman Bridge Hike and by using two hiking sticks and taking it very slowly we made it to a breathtaking view and vista.  Remember the tortoise and the hare?  The Natural Bridge isn't going anywhere and will be there when you get there."
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,As advertised,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I took several hikes during our time at Capitol Reef, this was as enjoyable as any of them and made for some of the best photo opportunities. This is one of the most popular trails, so expect to see other hikers and evidence of human activity, including graffiti and litter. We hiked in the early evening to avoid the masses and the heat, which proved to be a good decision. Would hike again in the future."
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Not much shade but worth the trek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hike to Hickman Bridge took at 45 min each way, which includes a few breaks in the shade for water. We arrived around 11. It was hot but not terrible. There are few steep areas but they’re fairly short. The view once you get to the bridge is worth it. There’s a pit toilet at the trailhead and the parking lot was nearly full when we arrived, however spots seem to turnover steadily though."
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Easy and short hike to beautiful natural bridge,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Hickman Bridge Trail is an easy and short (2 hours out and back) trail in Capitol Reef NP. It is definitely worth hiking this trail, but do it early in the morning, as it gets very hot here, even as early as 10 AM (bring water!)"
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Busiest Trail in Park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This might be the busiest trail in the park. The hike is definitely family friendly, but go early or late in the day if you want to get pictures of the bridge without tons of people underneath it. Not a lot of shade en route either."
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Wonderful hike with the stunning bridge in the end,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is a little steep in the beginning, but it is definitely doable. The bridge is so pretty, and we loved you could walk right up to it. Great photo opportunity! We also noticed some smaller bridges on the right when you are about 2/3 of the way in. We hopped down to check those out as well. "
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Nice trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is a nice loop trial to go to the Hickman bridge. I would rate it between easy and moderate, leaning towards easy.  One of the popular hikes in Capitol reef, but crowds were nothing compared to Zion,/Arches "
The Hickman Bridge Trail,4.5,Not as easy as the reviews say,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were there in the afternoon and it was warm. I'm in my 60s and not in tip top shape, however,  I  was surprised to discover the hike was not as easy as  MANY  reviewers indicated.  Yes, the bridge is glorious and beautiful to behold, but the trail is uphill mostly the while way. The first part is especially steep. There wasn't shade along the way. It was also the most crowded trail of the six I did in Utah last week. So, older people take note."
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Beautiful Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful, although challenging hike.  It is definitely worth hiking to the lake.  The views are just beautiful.  Be sure that you drive all the way to the parking by the Gulch.  It is a winding dirt-like road, so it is a little deceiving and you will see other cars parked for another trail along the side of the road.  I also suggest going in the morning and wearing layers.  "
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Excellent adventure! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an awesome hike. My husband and I are in relatively good shape for being in our early 50’s. We hiked all the way up to the lake. It was late August and there was still some snow. It was steep and challenging great at times, but if I could do it, just about anyone could. I was a bit afraid at first but so glad I did it. "
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Challenging and incredible!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This hike was incredible.  There were beautiful sights along the way.  It definitely climbs and there are a couple short but technical parts (going up and across larger rocks where no trail is present).  The top is so rewarding though.
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Great Hike in the Mountains near Breck,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very varied trail - bit of a road march to start but solid elevation gain, good views of lakes, waterfalls and mountains. Hiked to the second lake and only saw one other hiker on the way out. Go early to avoid heat and crowds."
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Great Hike in the Mountains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked Lower McCullough Gulch Trail on a beautiful Fall day.  It was about 2-3 miles and moderately challenging.  We were rewarded with beautiful mountain views and pretty foliage - including wonderful yellow Aspens.
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Loved This Trail ... But PLEASE Don't Wear Flip Flops!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this trail with our two daughters, aged 8 and 13.  We started around 9 am and arrived back to our car around 1:00, which included a half hour lunch stop at the waterfall.  Some tips:"
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Moderate Hike with Fantastic Panoramic views of the Mountains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved this hike! It was about 2 miles in and 2 miles out, and took us about 3 hours to complete, stopping for lots of pictures.  I'm not a fan of big drop offs, so the ride to this hiking trail was ROUGH for me, but slow and steady and you get there.  We arrived early - around 8:30 or 9 to avoid the larger crowds and ended up getting a close parking spot.  You have to park about a third to a half a mile away from the gated entrance to the area and then you have about another quarter of the mile before you reach the actual trail.  Some spots on the trail are hard to tell where you are going, but it is almost impossible to get lost.  Gorgeous views of the mountains, a waterfall, and a beautiful lake that feeds the falls await you on the glorious hike.  I would rate this trail as an easy to moderate hike for people that are active and well due to narrow bridges, uneven rock and some steep inclines.  I also highly suggest taking water with you and possibly a snack to eat.  Get up early to beat the crowds. There is one part of the trail that was clearly washed out by a rock slide. The trail completely disappears, so you must traverse the rocks to continue on your journey. The beautiful part of this hike is that everywhere you look and go, there is something spectacular to look at.  This is a must do for active folks when visiting Breckenridge."
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Breathtaking! Literally!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This beautiful hike climbs along a mountain creek up to a glacial lake. The scenery is gorgeous and the trail is usually well marked. The lake is at almost 12,000 feet, so unless you are used to that kind of elevation, plan on stopping frequently to catch your breath on the way up. Make sure and take plenty of water as well. But push on to the top -- it is so worth it. Take a break at the top with the nice little lunch you brought with you -- you'll feel exhilarated once you've rested a moment! And the climb down is much easier."
McCullough Gulch,4.5,"Waterfalls, cliffs, a lake, a rushing stream, rocks - it has it all!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is hands down my favorite hike ever.  We do it every year.  It is easy (as far as hiking at 9K feet goes!) - up and down in less than 3 hours including a nice stop for lunch.  Or you can make it harder and keep climbing after you reach the lake.  The scenery is stunning.  My teen kids love climbing over the rock quarry.  We all like jumping rocks across the lake to play in the snow - even in August!
McCullough Gulch,4.5,Parking for McCullough Gulch trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail was doable for us (mid 50's crowd) but we thought it was more on the difficult side of moderate. Probably due to the altitude and the rocky terrain. We had heard we should go early because it gets crowded so we got out there about 8:15 a.m. That was a good call because there were lots more people heading up as we were coming down. I'm posting this review mostly to let you know where to park for the trail. The first parking lot you come to is for Quandary Peak. A few feet beyond that you see the signs for McCullough Gulch and a few parking spaces before the gate.  Don't stop there! Drive through the gate and past the few cars that might be parked on the side of the road - they are still for Quandary Peak. Drive another 1.5 miles or so and park on the side of the road. People park on both sides of the road. It's not the best road but our minivan made it fine. There are signs right before the entrance to the trail ""no parking from here to gate"" but you can park anywhere before that. We recommend trekking poles as there are many, many rocks and tree roots and the poles were a big help. We made it to the falls area and the last stretch up to the lake is pretty steep and again the poles were helpful going up and coming down. It was a beautiful hike but we found we had to stop a lot on the way up to catch our breath. It ended up taking us about 3 hours to go up but only 1 hour to come down."
Congress Trail,5.0,Do not miss the Congress Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is accessible from the path to the General Sherman tree.  If you make it to see the Sherman, do yourself a favor, and spend another 30 to 60 minutes to walk in the grove and see the adjacent giant Sequoias, including those on the Congress Trail.  The walk among these trees is fairly easy and not strenuous.  If camping in nearby Lodgepole, take the free shuttle to the General Sherman upper parking lot.  After seeing the General Sherman tree and walking through the Congress Trail, you can pick up your ride back to camp at the lower parking lot at General Sherman."
Congress Trail,5.0,A Must Do if You Are Able,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked at General Sherman Tree parking lot. From there, the paved trail heads downward, with some few steps. The Congress Trail is well signed and you reach the turnoff just before the General Sherman Tree, which is just a tad beyond. We checked out that tree then headed out on Congress trail, which is also paved and has a bit more elevation gain. The trees here are stunning, truly awe inspiring. I found the plentiful evidence of fire damage to be, well, humbling and soulful. This trail is a pure jewel. It loops around, back to Sherman, and by then, gotta say, uphill to the parking lot was a bit of an effort. We entered Congress at9:30am, mid week. When we arrived back to Sherman, there were lines of people to take pictures.  "
Congress Trail,5.0,A photographer’s dream.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wow. I was not expecting to be so impressed by this place. The soft light filtering through the giant ancient Sequoias was ethereal. Walking this trail early in the morning after the sun has risen and before the crowds is a must. I spent hours wandering around.
Congress Trail,5.0,Ethereal just after sunrise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wow. I was not expecting to be so taken with this place. Getting there darling in the morning before the crowds is a must to experience the ethereal beauty and calm. The soft light filtering through the massive ancient Sequoias was a photographers dream!
Congress Trail,5.0,Touch a tree without breaking the rules.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing amount of sequoias and the trail gets close enough for touching without going off trail and damaging vegetation.  We went toward the evening around 6pm and had less people.  We were easily back up at the car before sunset which we went to Moro Rock to see.  Bathrooms are in parking lot above the hike.  Same area that you will see the General Sherman tree.
Congress Trail,5.0,A highlight of our visit to Seki..,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are only gonna do one day/trail in Sequoia this one should probably be considered. Maybe the largest collection of the biggest trees in the park (including General Sherman nearby). Easy access from the shuttle stop. In addition to Sherman, saw several others in the Top 20 including the President tree (equally as impressive as GS IMO), Chief, Lincoln, Washington Tree (not technically on the CT) and several amazing stands labeled The Senate and The House. Much of this trail is paved and a gently elevation gain that most people physically should be able to conquer. If you are only up for a few miles and have physically limitations.. do this one!"
Congress Trail,5.0,Overshadowed by Grant and Sherman but combine with Sherman Trail for lots of interesting trees,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Admittedly the General Sherman and General Grant trees and their trails take top billing, and deservedly so.  But if you want to avoid those crowds and still want to see numerous examples of the prime specimens, the NPS has done a good job of making the trees, or groups of trees, noticeable among their peers with special mark and signage along the trail.  A paved and easy trail, can be taken off the Sherman Tree Trail, so you can combine both and still not have a moderate walk at most."
Congress Trail,5.0,Magnificent ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went there with a group of friends. Impressed as we all left. Amazing gigantic trees around, free park entrance fee, easy and plenty parking, it has filtered water station and decent public restroom. It was surprisingly cold when we went there so bring your extra jacket. The trail went is quite easy and not too gruesome. "
Congress Trail,5.0,Great trail through the Giant Forest grove of sequoias,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Congress Trail is one of the connecting paths through the Giant Forest that starts near the General Sherman Tree in Sequoia National Park. The trail is just under 3 miles in length and mostly paved through mostly barren forest with a few streams and lots of sequoia trees to see. 
Congress Trail,5.0,Best Area for Lots of Giant Sequoias!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Parking for this trail is at the Sherman Tree Parking area (restrooms available here), off of Wolverton Rd (off of Generals Hwy).  We visited the General Sherman Tree (Wow!) first and then continued onto the Congress Trail.  The “Giant Forest Trail Map” we had purchased ($3.50) earlier at a visitor center was extremely helpful for this area of the park with all its many intersecting paths.  There had been a snow storm 2 days before and the Congress Trail was covered with snow/ice/slush.  We were glad to have our trekking poles with us for this hike.  We had to walk slower than usual to watch carefully where we placed our feet.  The Congress Trail was Great as it was so nice and quiet we felt like we had it all to ourselves - maybe because we started fairly early at 8:35 a.m. from parking area.  In addition to the Congress Trail we hiked a bit extra on the Alta Trail to see the Lincoln Tree (route is shown on the purchased map). That was well worth the extra effort as you can stand inside the open base of this grand sequoia tree.  The parking area was much more crowded when we returned at 11:05 a.m.  We spent 2 hours and 30 minutes total hiking in this area, but we hiked slower than usual due to the condition of the trails.  We felt this area of the park had the best concentration of giant sequoias.  If you only have time for one hike to see giant sequoias, be sure to do this one."
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,Lovely Little Rest Spot!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"As part of the Waterfall Corridor, my boyfriend and I stopped by here after visiting the Wahkeena Falls and before getting to Multnomah Falls. There is a small parking lot available right in front of the falls, and it's just a short walk to get there. Luckily, it wasn't so crowded when we arrived, so we were able to get some nice up close and personal shots. Would definitely recommend stopping by here!"
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,Nice waterfall with a short hike to see more,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We unfortunately didn't have a lot of time to explore the Columbus River Gorge area but this was a nice stop.  The view of the lower falls was very easy to get to and with a short hike we were able to get to the upper falls as well as the lookout point.  The hike did have a steep start but leveled off and was easy from then on.
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,Great hike to break up a long drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stopped here after visiting Crown Point (a beautiful historic ""rest area"" for travelers along the old scenic byway.) It's not as busy as Multnomah Falls, and parking was available (a free lot plus parking along the road.) The hike is uphill until you get to the upper falls, but it's in good shape The lower falls are pretty spectacular - you can drive/walk right to those. The upper falls are even better! The trail goes back behind them for a great viewpoint. You can walk down to the pool where the water hits to swim or enjoy the mist. Continue on the path to a beautiful overlook above the Gorge. But be warned: there are no guard rails and it's a sheer cliff to the bottom. A small sign nearby was a sad reminder to be careful: a young man died there years ago when he fell from the cliff. The trail continues to the next canyon, but we turned around after about 1 mile. "
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,Smaller waterfall but worth a visit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"On the road from Portland to Boise is a turn off for these falls. It’s not far off the main road and there is a decent amount of free parking. Like many others, we parked, had a look, took some photos and then drive into Multnomah Falls. But these falls are well worth a visit."
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,Very pretty.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Well worth the drive to stop and see the Horsetail Falls. It is so very lush and green here.  The ferns are huge. March was a great time to be here as the water flow was heavy making for a very pretty show.
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,Good spot for a picnic lunch,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We honestly wound up here because all the parking was full at Multnomah Falls but it turned out great. The falls are right on the roadside with parking and no hiking required. You can hike up to the upper falls but we didn’t. The falls sit in almost an amphitheater where the water spray keeps it very cool even on hot days. There are a couple picnic tables but the low walls and rocks are also perfect for sitting. There is a big, shallow pool where you can wade in the cool water. Nice stop."
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,Don't drive by it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful, robust waterfall right along the road, an easy stop for anyone.    Seemed to be plenty of parking on a rainy day.  Nothing else to do there but be amazed at the water!  (or start a hike at the nearby trailhead). "
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,A smaller but still impressive falls just down the road from Multnomah Falls,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the somewhat scaled down falls within a mile or so (east) of Multnomah Falls. It has a small parking lot; we were able to wait for a couple of minutes and get a space. Once in the lot, you merely have to cross the road to see the falls. "
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,"Beautiful waterfall, even if you just want to park and admire it.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This waterfall is right off the road and you do not have to hike to see it (I am sure the hike is great, but I was glad not to have to hike to see it!). At the base of the waterfall is a pond, and kids enjoy that area a lot. A very pretty spot, DEFINITELY worth a stop."
Horsetail Falls- Columbia River Gorge,4.5,Easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Make sure to hit the .4 mile to the upper falls. You can walk behind the waterfall. Upper falls also called Ponytail Falls. Great views. Stunning waterfall. 
Fairyland Loop,5.0,great photos. excellent experience with a mid hike surprise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,we started early from the parking and did the loop. it took about 4 hrs not including our stop at the general store. it was awsome with incredible views. I recommend start early to avoid the sun as much of the hike is exposed. there are amazing views so take photos. when you reach the rim trail take a detor to the general store. there is food and the amazing surprise of beer for as cheap as 0.75 per can. 
Fairyland Loop,5.0,Just a little snowshoe hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"In winter, the road is closed but groomed as a trail.  Once can cross country ski or snowshoe in.  In fact, the trail was so well groomed that people could actually hike in to see Fairyland.  They ask that if you leave more than 1"" deep track of any kind, that you do not use the groomed area.  Most were respectful of that and used just one far side of the trail.  Once you reach the overlook, you can then descend on another amazing trail.  It is best to take your ski or snowshoe pole.  And definitely have on some kind of hiking boot as the mud areas are quite slippery."
Fairyland Loop,5.0,Wonderland in Fairyland.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I've hiked hundreds of miles of trails all over Utah. I live in Moab and that should tell you something about my walking experience. This is the most beautiful trail I've ever stepped on. Hiked the Rim Trail to Sunrise point where I ran away because of the crowds and dove down into Fairyland Loop from there leaving all people but a few behind. It was breathtaking to say the least. Bring lots of water and take it all in. Not an easy trail. With Tower arch and everything else I clocked almost 9 miles. Loved every single step of it. 
Fairyland Loop,5.0,A happy mistake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We meant to take the Queens loop but got on Fairyland trail from sunrise point. We don't regret a step of it. It's hard to gawk and walk at the same time so we took a looonnngg time to get to tower bridge area and then returning but the hoodoos all look so different from various angles, it's hard to walk with purpose. We also spent a lot of time finding shapes in the hoodoos. It's definitely a moderate trail. My 78 yr old husband did this and he's the reason we turned back before tower bridge, when he says it's time to go back, we go. Towards the top he was tired but was glad he did it. After a picnic lunch he was recovered enough to walk the bristlecone trail at rainbow point."
Fairyland Loop,5.0,One of our favorite all time hikes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,On the lodge’s recommendation - thank you Donna!  We did this connecting hike from the Rim Trail all 8 miles and 1700 ft elevation change through to  Sunset Point.  One of our top all time hikes that takes you deep into the canyon ( several times!).  The differing hoodoo vantage points and changes in landscapes from the pinion pines at the rim to twisted gray bristlecone trees.  Did in April with Hardly an animal or insect in sight. Bring hiking poles if you’re 65+ like us.
Fairyland Loop,5.0,Best hike in Bryce! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Woo! One of the most beautiful and secluded hikes we’ve been on. There are highs and lows (literally and mentally)! You see everything- hoodoos from the top and bottom, all kinds of different formations, Sandhills, and forest! The change in terrain and landscape was mind blowing! You go down, up a pretty steep incline, back down and 1 more steep incline! It was like 50% easy and 50% hard incline. We went clockwise so, at the trailhead looking out on the canyon we went left which provided lots of shade on the way back and walked the rim on the way back too which was cool because we got to see all that we hiked from above! We left at 4:15p on a Thursday and got back at 7:45p. We hiked the whole trip without seeing anyone (~6mi) until we got to the campsite (the last 45mins)! Must-do hike in Bryce! Hiking boots helpful and lots of water! "
Fairyland Loop,5.0,"Second only to Wall Street in experience, but without any crowds",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have done almost all of the hikes in the Bryce newspaper given to visitors, and this is at the top.  Okay, tied with whatever means you use to access Wall Street, but that is a far more demanding hike and no place to look for solitude.  Fairyland is at the far end of the trail system, out beyond the crowds near the lodge and visitor center.  It is longer in distance, but less physically demanding than many shorter hikes because the elevation changes are gradual.  Wonderful scenery looking into the ampitheater from an angle you don't get from any other trail.  Even the rim walk doesn't do this area justice, while Fairlyland gets you down into the ampitheater so you can walk among the formations and look at, or sometimes up, at them instead of down on them.  Plenty of places to stop and rest.  As long as you're making the trek be sure to take a very short (100 yards?) side trail to Tower Bridge, something you cannot see from any other vantage point or trail in the park.  Note:  the shuttle system will take you to the start/end of the trail, when operating, so you don't have to be concerned about leaving a car or arranging for pickup."
Fairyland Loop,5.0,Difference but fabulous views than the amphitheater.  Do both if you can,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did the hike from Sunset Point to Tower Bridge and than back again.  We did not do the loop.  It was about 4.6 miles in total and 830 ft ascend.  Of course you are going all down into the canyon to Tower Bridge and then the ascend is mainly all on the way back up.  The view are significantly different than what you will experience at for example Navajo and Queens trail so I'm very glad we did this one also.  The trail was pretty quite.  Some other hikers but all stretchered out along the trail
Fairyland Loop,5.0,Hot but Gorgeous,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went in July so of course it was going to be hot.  We knew that going in.  We started at Fairlyand Point at the small but almost deserted parking lot and hiked the 8 miles in a counterclockwise direction.  This means the last mile and a half or so were very steep as we came out of the canyon.  We started about 7:15 am and so the heat only got bad right at the end.  Took us about 4 hours.  Gorgeous.  If you have a choice, I think the fall would be a better time."
Fairyland Loop,5.0,Amazing and varied views on this hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose this hike for the length (8 miles) and for the fact that it is a loop that does not include the main amphitheater area. So glad we did it! The trail (starting at Fairyland Point and heading down from there) takes you into the canyon for beautiful views of hoodoos from below. Then you hike up and over a ridge with more beautiful views from above. Then you go back down to see Tower Bridge and up to Sunset Point. Amazing views all around! And then the last part takes you back to Fairyland Point on the rim trail for even more great views from above. This was one of the best hikes we have taken in a long time! Lots of varied terrain and so many different things to see. But we didn't see a lot of other people, which was another plus for this trail. Highly recommend!"
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,A disappointment,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"This park is apart of the the Echo Rangers program which is an educational program that focuses on the county’s ecological, cultural, heritage and outdoor resources. The program is offered at more than 50 sites including parks, museums, libraries and historical sites for children in grades 1-5th grade. "
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,A great place to visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"An hour and a half from Orlando, this is a hidden gem, although there are many beaches along this coast, the one at this park is outstanding and all for $10. Huge stretch of white sand, with life guard, a concrete boardwalk that reaches out into the ocean. You can also walk along the park towards a very large sandy bay. This isn’t a huge park, but well maintained, with clean bathrooms, shelters with picnic benches and BBQ grills. We saw many birds, lizards, gopher tortoises and we were delighted to see dolphins. The lighthouse is not part of this park, it’s very close but you have to pay a separate fee to enter it."
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,Beautiful place for sunrise/sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I arrived at the park at 6am when it opened, to view the sunrise. This park is so beautiful, with lots of boardwalk, and a very long jetty, it is wheelchair/scooter friendly ! With access to the beach as well, and the majestic Ponce Inlet Lighthouse looms overhead in the backdrop. I do feel that the $10 entrance fee is a little much, given there are not any facilities except for a restroom. However, if you are handicap and have a sticker, you can get in for free."
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,Great meal after a day of riding,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rode out to the Lighthouse for a meal and was pleasantly surprised at the overall atmosphere.  Everyone had a great meal for a very reasonable price, staff was friendly and informed, and surroundings were very relaxing.  Wildlife was everywhere and it was just a great place to enjoy a meal with friends."
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,For those who appreciate nature,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lighthouse Point Park is at the very end of Ponce Inlet.  The park has beaches on the ocean and on the Halifax River.  You can sunbathe, surf, fish, walk, picnic or just enjoy the view. There is a long pier into the inlet but currently, it is difficult to access because of storm damage.  If you are agile, you can still climb onto it.  There are many different places with water access.  It also has a dog beach.  There are some picnic tables(some covered)"
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,Money Trap,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"first off - as a native to this area, i remember this place before it was a park that you had to pay to visit, i digress."
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,Perfect place for a fun time with your dog.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,What a great park for a fun time with your dog.  Since Volusia Cty doesn't allow dog on the beaches this is a wonderful solution.  Dogs are allowed on the riverside of the park and there is plenty of nice sandy beaches for the pets to play.  So happy we found this place.
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,Natural Florida beauty!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Spent the morning here geocaching in a light rain. Such a beautiful park! Love the boardwalk trails. Allows you to be in the dunes without destroying them. Highlight of the morning was running into a huge gopher turtle. Magnificent creature. This park has excellent facilities and leashed dogs are permitted. $10 per vehicle entrance fee and worth every penny. Highly recommended!
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,Off weather outing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to visit this attraction based on the recommendation of my niece who lives in Orlando and has visited the site previously. The admittance  fee was very reasonable. The grounds were very well maintained and the exhibits were well kept up. I did not go all the way to the tp of the lighthouse due to my fear of heights, but my wife did and enjoyed the view."
Lighthouse Point Park,4.5,Enjoy the history,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Love seeing the lighthouse and surrounding structures. You can take a tour or just enjoy the gift shop. I have visited several times and I learn something new each time.  Had the pleasure of meeting Nelley, the lighthouse cat!"
Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Not what I expected,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a bucket list thing I should have removed from the bucket. The evening tours start at six which is when the nature center closes, so get there early if you want to walk around and watch the videos and go to the gift shop. Here’s the thing - yes, the cranes come in and there are a huge amount of them but they are quite far away. Really far. Even with an expensive scope you can’t see them very well. So this idea that you’re going to be up close and personal with the cranes is not based in fact. The footbridge tour is cheap and it should be. We had good binoculars so we could see them and quite a few flew overhead which was fun. But all in all, this wasn’t what I wanted. God bless them for taking care of the cranes, don’t get me wrong. If you’re going to do this, spend money to go to the blind in the morning. Or just go to the Nature Center and watch the live stream. Also, when you drive into and out of Grand Island the cranes are right there on the side of the road. They were closer than we were at the footbridge. So maybe pull over. :)  The staff was very very nice. Oh also mind their advice about dressing in layers. It was really hot at 6 pm and freezing at 7:45."
Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Fabulous Place - Please Support!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were in Nebraska to specifically view sandhill cranes. We were actually on our way home when we decided to stop at CraneTrust. I am so glad we did. This place is an oasis in the midst of corn fields. It is beautiful and does a wonderful job at supporting efforts to protect sandhill cranes and other wildlife. The walls are covered in local art (I purchased a piece to take home) and they offer a short introductory video. The staff was kind, friendly, and helpful. The gift shop had the best selection of gifts we had found. I was so impressed by everytjing here, that I decided to purchase a membership and support it further."
Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Family trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited the Crane Trust in the afternoon/evening March 9, 2023.  We were promptly created by staff and told all about the birds and where to go to see them.  We really hoped to be able see them go to roost relatively close, but they stayed away from the observation deck. My kids (9, 11, and 13) enjoyed the stop."
Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Grand purpose excellently achieved,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Magnificent even though we arrived after the cranes had departed. Short trail to bridge across the Platte. The art work displayed is all outstanding. Loved the displays showing the many different varieties of ducks, especially exhibits displaying size comparisons between cranes (sandhill vs whooping, for example.)  Amanda greeted us and shared tips about how to visit during the migration period; she also helped us package up three Rick Rasmussen photos we purchased. "
Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Great experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We stopped by because we’re Crane lovers and have missed the spring migrations. We just wanted to see the visitors center as a preview of next year when we can see the cranes in person. They have a few videos and more Crane information than the normal person can absorb. There is beautiful artwork for sale and plenty of Crane souvenirs. The attendant was very knowledgeable and helpful. We’ll be back next March. 
Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Perfect Timing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had warmer weather so early March was ideal. The rhythm of nature is very much alive and well here in the heartland.  Thanks to Deb and Guy, our naturalists; they were great to talk with and passionate!  The blinds are enclosed, dry and comfortable, I could camp in there if they'd let me!"
Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Incredible experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The tour was well organized by enthusiastic, knowledgeable volunteers. The blinds were right on the riverbank, and the view was amazing. We chose the evening viewing and would like to come again for a morning tour. Can’t say enough good things about the center and the viewing experience. I wish I had taken more time in the gift shop."

Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Fantastic Experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We attended both the evening and the morning blind experience. Staff (who volunteer) are super knowledgeable and share so many facts about the sandhill cranes. They were all kind, patient, helpful and very considerate of the birds! Seeing them was an incredible experience that we will not forget!   Jill"
Crane Trust Nature & Visitor Center,4.5,Great trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I made a quick trip to the visitor center today.  It is only open for trail use and not the indoor visitor center, but it was a nice day and the path was well marked and easy to access.   My timing could have been better for seeing the sandhill cranes (sunrise/sunset) but it was a nice walk and area to expore.  There are lots of informational signs that make the visit even better."
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,tough hike and tough to find parking space,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A very popular trail near swanky Vail, so obviously the one I decided upon if you get to do just one hike in the area. It's a tough 2-mile climb to the falls, but the trail continues past the namesake waterfalls if you wish to go further. You can take a little breather near the stream where it plunges down to form the falls. The mountainsides are dotted with beautiful aspens, making this one particularly spectacular in fall. I suppose you could perform this hike in a tight two hours, but count on three hours to do it comfortably. Being a very popular hike, with its trailhead near Vail and near the Interstate running along it (there is some noise pollution from it), parking is very, very hard to come by (we were lucky somebody left when we got there). If you have enough time, I would probably recommend the (free?) shuttle service the town of Vail offers."
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,Perfect family hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of our family's new favorite hikes ever. We went early (8 a.m.) and it was a quiet hike up. More crowded on the way down. Took my family of four (kids 10 and 12) about 3 hours to hike up as we stopped frequently to enjoy views, etc. One hour to hike down. Steady climb up, with a bit of scrambling near the top, but this hike could be accomplished by almost anyone if enough time and care is taken. There were no dangerous points as long as not raining and even dogs and children younger than ours were hiking it. At the top you are rewarded with a waterfall and stunning views, although the entire way is picture worthy. My kids are not avid hikers and both appreciated this hike through and through. My 12 year old son even thanked me for picking it which was highly unusual. "
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,What a hike!  We were proud of ourselves ! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is not for out of shape people or people who suffer from any leg or hip issues.  It took us just under 2 hrs to get to the water fall , which was awesome ( the lake is another mile and and half further- we did not do ) Beautiful country along  the hike.  People were so friendly and very courteous on the trails when passing by or you having people pass by you.  Us flat landers were very proud of our accomplishment! You don’t realize what you just did until on your way back down. Take a backpack with waters and snacks. I saw some that had packed sandwiches.  Have fun and do it ! "
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,Stunning views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous canyon with beautiful wild flowers in the summer, a stunning waterfall to spread out and enjoy, and tons of green trees. Really a beautiful trail worth doing in Vail. It can be a bit steep right at the start and not recommended with dogs since it is narrow. "
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,Pretty but steep climb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We didn't make it all the way to the falls, but the trail is beautiful.  The trail is well maintained.  It is fairly steep though and for us we didn't want to push things with only being at altitude for one day.  I wish we could have made it to the falls!"
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,Very nice!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was my second trail experience in my like, and I liked it very much. The view is amazing right from the beginning, even though is summer it was not too crowded. All hikers wore masks and were very respectful trying to do social distancing where the trail was narrow."
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,Terrific but challenging hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful trail with several challenging sections.  At start, there is a steep climb for first mile. Then it gets easier with wonderful vistas to enjoy. Towards the top it gets very challenging again - in late May there were many treacherous areas of ice and snow and mud. We are a couple in our early 60’s that work out vigorously everyday and in great shape, but this was hard at times. Once we got to falls, we turned around and the rains started. Coming down in the rain with all trails reduced to mud became even more challenging. It took us 2 3/4 hours to get to Falls and 2 hours to come down. But it was worth it. "
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,Take Vail bus to this incline hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I must have read outdated trail reports on Booth Creek because there was no parking anywhere near the trailhead. You must ride the Vail bus and then walk 5 min up the road thru the neighborhood to the trailhead. Once there, it’s a breathy incline up for the majority of the way. My husband and I are in our mid-50’s and in good shape. Our mid-August hike had many of the flowers past peak, but there was a fair amount of color as we wound thru the meadows and aspens.  Perhaps we were looking for a sign of some sort when we “arrived” at the falls, but there isn’t any."
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is quite a hike to the top. But if you are up to it, the trip is rewarding. Be sure to bring plenty of water and clothing for the changing environment. The falls are where most people turn back. It is still a good walk to them and worth the effort. The trail is easy to follow and wide enough to let people coming the opposite direction get by pretty easily. There are a few steep areas but nothing too challenging. The altitude will get you if you are not used to it. Be sure to look back down the valley for the great views. Also, leave enough time to get headed down before the typical summer afternoon thunderstorms roll in. That, and again, don't forget to bring enough water."
Booth Falls Trail,4.5,Not worth the hype,2.0 of 5 bubbles,With all the wonderful hikes to experience in Vail I found this to be the most disappointing based on the reviews. You have to take a shuttle to the trailhead but the bus lets you off a quarter mile from the trailhead. You walk through a neighborhood to enter the trail and listen to road noise for the first half of the trail. The trail is steep and rocky. The falls is underwhelming.  I don’t see what the fuss is about. Go hike somewhere else. Not worth the time and energy.
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,Closed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Mount Timpanogos Cave National Monument is a cool system of caves that you can walk through. We knew ahead of time that the caves were closed and that we would not be able to enter them. However, we had assumed that we would still be able to hike up to the cave. Unfortunately, this is not the case. There is a gate preventing entry about one-third of the way up the hill to the cave area. So while you can still walk part of the way up to the cave, mostly you will not be able to visit the monument at all."
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,Lovely if challenging hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great activity near Provo Utah.  Hike was steep but lovely terrain and views.  Well maintained despite weather related damage over the spring.  The cave tour was interesting.  The caves are not large like others I've been in but there are interesting small formations.  You do need reservations and I would make them well ahead for larger groups as they only allow 16 people per time slot.
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,Nice place to picnic...6/27/2020,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Looking for a picnic spot between Zion and Park City, we found this along the way. We had a babbling brook and the perfect temperature for eating our lunch. The cave was closed due to Covid-19 so we didn’t hike, but we then drove up over the winding alpine loop road to end up with a terrific sight with chair lifts moving! We had to ride to the top of Sundance! What a find."
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,Excellent Facilities and Great Staff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You're hiking up a mountain so even though the trail is paved and well maintained, it's all uphill. We hiked at midday in August and found decent shade cover from the trees, very little of the trail bore the full brunt of sun. Also note the time on your ticket is when you check in to the Visitors Center below. From that time onwards they give you 1.5 hours to get to the cave's entrance; so if you ticket says 12:30, you are scheduled for the 2:00 cave tour. Be assured 1.5 hours is more than adequate for even the slowest of hikers. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed our tour. Our ranger Sabrina Santos was very knowledgeable and welcomed every question asked. It was clear she loved the subject. We never felt rushed. She gave us so much fascinating information and history that I am certain our group came out much wiser than when we'd entered. Sabrina was all the best parts you'd hope to meet in a Forest Ranger. I feel quite lucky that we got her as our tour guide."
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,"Don't underestimate - it IS a hike, but so worth it.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is actually 3 cave systems connected together with fascinating differences.   One of the better cave tours is terms of variability of landmarks.  Well worth it.
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,Strenuous Hike with Fantastic Views! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fairly challenging hike to the top, but the views are well worth it... even if you don't make it to the caves themselves.  While there is elevation and incline to give you a work out, the trail / path is a paved surface.  The cave tours were running at limited intervals when I visited, so I missed out on that, but I'm glad I stopped here anyways.  Well worth a stop if you're in the area. "
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,Fun hike and tour,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The great part of a fall hike, is the leaves changing.  Intense reds and oranges from the scrub oak were perfect for the day.  The hike to the cave is strenuous.  The attraction itself is amazing.  So many features in this series of caverns.  Be sure to take a jacket with you."
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,Pretty and fun,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked this prior to the  Covid-19 shutdown.  It's a steep hike up  but it's on a paved trail with nice views. Take plenty of water and go slow and easy both up and down.  The trail has some beautiful views however the cave isn't that impressive. It seems like the cave doesn't have that many formations compared to the others we've been to.
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,"Strenuous hike, but worth it",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"You can visit the park without hiking to the cave, but that's like going to a football game tailgate party at the stadium and never going in...fun, but not the full experience. The trail took us about 1hr to climb at a consistent, but not fast pace (we had kids with us down to age 6). The hike is strenuous and though there is shade on the trail it can still be hot mid-summer (we went mid-July). The trail condition was very good--it's paved asphalt the entire way with walls and guard rails when really needed."
Timpanogos Cave National Monument,4.5,Hard Hike Cool Cave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We lucked out and went on a partially cloudy day in July.  It was hot, but not scorching.  The hike is hard but it has beautiful views and a great reward at the top.  The cave is really neat but if I had to choose only 1 thing to do on a single day stop in Utah, I'd take Zions or Arches over the Timpanogos Cave without any question (5 stars as a cool local attraction).  On our way up we met a heavy couple (mid 70's) that had only made it 1/2 way and had turned around.  There are no strollers or wheel chairs allowed on the path.  You are not allowed to jog or run on the path."
Wildcat Trail,4.5,Sunrise Wildcat trail walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We left just before sunset. The monuments emerged against the backdrop of the wide open space. It was beyond peaceful.

Wildcat Trail,4.5,Don't take you own vehicle there,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"make new, or a road. Thank God we had a Jeep rental. Compared to a national park like Yellowstone, it is a shame such a short trail, image of the Navajo People in the reservation is in such a deplorable condition and presentation."
Wildcat Trail,4.5,Great Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The 3.8-mile Wildcat Trail starts near the driver's entrance of the 17-mile loop of the park. The tribe asks that you sign in and out at the trailhead. As I recall, the hike took my family 2-3 hours. The hike is easy/moderate until the last maybe 0.5 mile where you climb back out of the valley through soft sand. It takes you around the West Mitten Butte with great views of multiple monuments. Great hike!"
Wildcat Trail,4.5,Beautiful hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the only trails open available for the public to hike. After we did the morning backcountry tour, we went back in the afternoon and did this 4- mile hike. It was an easy hike, pretty flat, and took us through some incredibly beautiful scenery."
Wildcat Trail,4.5,September Visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Was here in late September this year. We arrived around 5PM so the car tour was out of the equation, and we decided to take the Wildcat Trail. "
Wildcat Trail,4.5,Monument valley is bucket list!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Amazing place to visit.  Highly recommend doing the Wildcat trail hike. It is easy and how many folks hike in Monument Valley? Great hike.  Then do the 17 mile drive through the valley which is amazing.  Lots of photo op places to stop. We stayed in Mexican Hat which was great!  Other places to see - Goosenecks State Park, Mexican Hat Rock, Mesa Verde National Park.  Great trip! "
Wildcat Trail,4.5,Beautiful flat easy trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We went later in the day when not as hotandlighting was beautiful.  Easy flat trail with great vistas.  Can go at whatever pace you with  Road areas are dusty and some drivers are a little erratic so use caution

Wildcat Trail,4.5,A must-do if you visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You really can't get the scale and variety of this place without a least walking part of this trail. To walk all the way around the Mitten is amazing. It's not a hard hike (although challenging in high winds), and well worth it. Get some exercise!"
The Holden Arboretum,4.5,Beautiful area cannot wait until springtime to do it again,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice area to walk around with all the trees, plants and ponds. Decorated very nice for Halloween. The canopy walk was nice and the Emergent tower had breathtaking views of the area and you can see Lake Erie.   "
The Holden Arboretum,4.5,Perfect Fall Afternoon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent the afternoon here and had a great time. If you receive SNAP benefits you can get in for $1 each simply by showing your card. Our dog was free and was allowed anywhere on the grounds but not in or on structures (visitor's center, emergent tower, canopy walk, etc.). One of our group does not like heights, so the rest of us were still able to experience the tower and canopy walk. We did have to wait a bit for the tower, but it was worth it. Just be aware that it's a lot of climbing. I was quite dizzy by the time I got to the top. The view is definitely worth it though. If you are afraid of heights, please be aware that the tower sways. Two members of my group immediately headed back down because they didn't like the swaying. The canopy walk did not have a wait and was lower, but the bridges between the trees do move. It didn't seem to bother anyone though. All of the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. We really liked the Stickwork sculpture and the walk around the lake was lovely. Fall is a great time of year to visit because there are extremely clever displays of pumpkins, gourds, and scarecrows everywhere. I would love to return to see more of the grounds."
The Holden Arboretum,4.5,Meh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,I’ve been looking forward to going there for a couple years now.  I was actually a little disappointed.  It’s pretty but I don’t feel it was worth the cost of admission.  The canopy walk was neat.  We did that twice.  I didn’t care for the emergent tower.  After the long walk up there’s really no view except just a typical tree line.   The flowers and landscape is pretty but don’t feel like it was worth $50 for the family.
The Holden Arboretum,4.5,Nature walking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had beautiful weather when we visited. Our bucket list was to do the canopy walk and the emergent tower. We were able to do both. My children have a fear of heights as well as I do. We all faced our fears and saw incredible views! It was a small hike from the parking lot to the area we climbed. The Holden is also part of the museums4all organization so you can get discounted tickets and parking if you have an EBT card. Right now, the flowers and trees were still bare but I bet it should look great in the summer or fall."
The Holden Arboretum,4.5,The perfect way to spend an afternoon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The grounds and trails are lovely and peaceful.  This is an excellent way to reconnect with nature not too far from the city.  Plan to spend some time. Three hours is about right unless you are going to hike some of the longer trails.

The Holden Arboretum,4.5,A Tonic for the Soul,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hadn’t been to Holden in years and decided to visit while the October weather was still mild.  We bought tickets on-line in advance and were treated with a beautiful, warm and sunny day.  The grounds are beautifully maintained and many of the Fall flowers were still in bloom.  We spent several hours exploring the many gardens and ponds including the tower and canopy walk."
The Holden Arboretum,4.5,Out and About,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful location to explore — Butterfly garden & canopy walk are highlights. Different spots shine in different seasons. Most walkways are paved. Although they advertise grab and go food, this is pretty limited so might not want to rely of that resource."
The Holden Arboretum,4.5,So amazing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,So cool...go when it's not busy so you don't have to spend the same time with loud obnoxious idiots! The place is SO serene and beautiful -  must see if/when you can.  Mostly handicap accessible.  You'll need about an 2-3 hours. Go and enjoy!
The Holden Arboretum,4.5,Special Holden Arboretum,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the more peaceful and beautiful places I have been on a weekday in late October with colorful leaves, gorgeous trail walks, and easy trails for a senior with a cane and even getting to the Murch Canopy Walk through the trees was accessible.  My husband did the 200 steps up to the Tower and the view was incredible.  Stickwork Tilt a Whirl was phenomenal but gone now.  Well worth the admission."
Height of Land,5.0,Breath Taking View!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,While staying at Coos Canyon and heading to Rangeley this was a great stop along the way.

Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,"Easy, but great for families and dogs",3.0 of 5 bubbles,We were in town from Houston for almost 2 wks.  Had our dog with us who is used to walking 2-3 miles/day. Disappointing the National Park trails are not pet friendly except this trail and one other.  Every time we drove by the trail was BUSY so never gave it a try.  Tonight we decided to go since it was a week day and purposely tried around 6 pm hoping all the tourists would be gone and enjoying their evening meal.  That was the magic time!   We had the trail almost entirely to ourself with our dog.  Was wonderful!  
Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,Great for biking or hiking! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail is great for a bike ride or a hike. Can be a little difficult to find parking if it gets crowded so it’s best to go early. Has some hills but they’re not that bad. It’s not a loop. It’s 2 miles there and then 2 miles back. Saw a lot of nice scenery and a lot of people walking with their dogs. 
Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,1 of the only 2 trails dogs are permitted on in the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This a short, easy, 4-mile “hike” (more like a walk) on the Gatlinburg Trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This is 1 of the only 2 trails dogs are allowed on due to bear encounters. We parked at the visitor's center, walked to the town of Gatlinburg, and back. We saw a graveyard from the 1800s, a small waterfall, lots of beautiful foliage, and the GSMNP park sign (fun to take a picture with the sign)."
Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,"It’s ok, not strenuous at all",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was not a favorite hike, but at least we can say we’ve hiked it.  There is no reward at the end, only went because dogs are allowed. Had I not been walking on a fractured foot...we would’ve hiked to the waterfall (dogs aren’t allowed on that hike). Beautiful area, nice Easter hike, river was a great addition."

Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,Fun & Easy Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I recently walked this natural terrain trail. Walked roundtrip from Gatlinburg to the Sugarlands Visitor Center. Running between the Little Pigeon River & Newfound Gap Road (US 441), the footpath is wide, mostly level and well maintained making it a viable option for most people. At the 1.8 mile mark you will reach a group of Park maintenance buildings. At this point the trail ends and you will walk along the road for the final stretch to reach the Visitor Center. Really enjoyed my time here. FYI… One of only two trails in the National Park that is Dog Friendly (must be on a leash). The other is the Oconaluftee River Trail."
Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,Scenic path ruined ny traffic noise,1.0 of 5 bubbles,While the trail looks like the picture and is easy/ flat to walk it is the worst hike I have ever taken! The mountain road is nearby and the traffic noise is very disturbing on such a scenic walk especially since there were quite a few motorcycles speeding on that road. One actually passes under the bridge where the traffic flows. Very irritating - we turned around at that point.
Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,Great trail to go with your dog!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very neat trail, one of two that dogs are allowed on in the Smokies. Nice and soothing stroll beside the river. Only negative is that you have to walk alongside the road for a little while and there’s no trash bins along the way. Parking next to the Ranger Station gives best access to the path. Has access to the water as well to cool off for warmer months."
Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,A must hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We unfortunately didn't have time to hike this trail in full. Which is a shame, because it's beautiful.

We were able to take the stroller down this trail with no issues as well."
Gatlinburg Trail,4.5,Nice Leisurely Walk Along Side The River,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My brother & I recently walked the Gatlinburg trail. The trail runs between Gatlinburg and the Sugarland Visitor Center. Just under 4 miles round trip, this natural terrain trail is mostly flat and runs through the forest along side the West prong of the Little Pigeon river providing beautiful river views along the way. If you want a nice leisurely walk through the woods then this is it. This trail is one of only two dog friendly trails in the GSMNP. Trail is also bicycle, & kid friendly. Limited parking at trailhead in Gatlinburg."
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Great Hike along the Piedra River.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I hiked in this area two days while staying in Pagosa Springs. We hiked both ways from the trailhaed near where the county road crosses the river. A lot of the trail is down in the canyon just along the river. Beautiful views. In one area we met and visited with a group of young people, mostly just off from college. They seemed amazed to see a 70+ couple walking the trail! It was great fun and lots to see. "
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Beautiful Hike that's accessible year round,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went for a hike on Piedra River Trail in early April.  Many of the other trailheads in the forest were inaccessible due to closed roads but the road was open as far as the trailhead.  In the first mile, the trail heads into a narrow gorge along the river.  There were a lot icicles and snowy patches and it was really beautiful.  After the gorge, there is a bend in the river and it opens up to a wide river valley with great views.  The entire trail is about 11 miles, but we only hiked the first 4 miles to Weminuche Creek.  It's a great trail for a day hike or backpacking, especially in winter and early spring when other trails are inaccessible."
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Great trail for everyone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The first 1.5 miles of the trail has been a family favorite for years. We take it every time we come to Pagosa. Close distance to the Piedra river so you can see and hear it as you walk the trail. The first .8th of a mile will take you to a bend of the river. A nice large flat area for family's with young children to hike to and then turn back. During this part of the hike there are interesting rock formations that the trail goes through. The river bends here as does the trail for a fairly level walk through meadows. At the 1.5 mile mark there is a bridge that cross over a stream that is running into the Piedra. A nice place to stop and snack.  Here is where often our family members turn around to walk back the 1.5 miles to the parking area. If you hike another 1.5 miles you come to a larger bridge that crosses the Piedra. This is on a different trial that goes down to the left, You will see the bridge from the trail. We hike to it and stop there for a rest and then return back the way we came to the parking area for a good 6 mile hike, If you stay on the main trail and not go down to the bridge, the trail just keeps going (climbing a bit now) through the trees. We went a good distance (until we came to another bridge) but this part of the trial wasn't as interesting so we turned around. "
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Beautiful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great Trail, beautiful scenery.  It took a little while to get to from Pagosa, but within a half mile of the hike it was totally worth it.  We only went 2 miles out to the bridge and turned around.  I'd probably recommend only going 1 mile out with small children."
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Beautiful hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were only able to spend 2 hours hiking this trail, but we will try to get back and hike more of the trail, as well as the ice cave region adjacent to it.  The river cuts a deep canyon, but the trail is pretty well maintained and walkable.  Beautiful scenery; great experience.  "
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Exciting,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Half mile trail fairly easy except for about 50 feet where trail narrows and slants downward to the rocks & rushing water flows.  Just be careful.  Falls were running beautiful when we went.
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Great hike / GPS locator not correct,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful Trail shaded by towering cliffs. Lots of trees and rocks to climb. Water was a great temperature and fun to wade into. This is a great place to hike with your family. Lots of water sounds make it really relaxing to have a picnic. Our GPS took us to the wrong location initially. It is about 16 miles from Highway 160. 6 miles on the pavement and 10 miles on the dirt road. The trail head as well marked and on the left. 
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Well worth the trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a gorgeous trail with Mountain View’s, river views, meadow views. The road to the trail head involves 9 miles of rough gravel road but so worth it. Trail head well marked. Rated easy there are rocky ups and downs, smooth dirt and meadow trails. The River running by your side is amazing. The view on the road to the trail head are not to be missed!"
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Soooo beautiful!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My hubby and I hiked this trail to the 3 mile mark and returned.  We are in our early 60’s and active.  May be tough if you are older and not doing much physically.  There are several places that are rocky and narrow.  Wear hiking boots or shoes with good traction.  The views are beautiful.  
Piedra River Trail,5.0,Beautiful Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had been told when you started the trail you could go left on the river trail or go right on a trail that would lead you to some ice fissures.  We went to the right.  We were also told once you got there you could find a trail that went to the right, go 1/4 to 1/2 mile and you would come to the top of a bluff .  We did and were we rewarded.  You are looking out over a large valley with the Piedra River running down through it.  It was gorgeous!!  We then followed the bluff around and came back to the river trail.  So, we went several miles down that and back.  A lot of hiking but well worth it.  I wish they had signs up for more.  It was beautiful."
Grandview State Park,5.0,One should get ready for stunning views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Grandview has unbelievable views of the New River and the Appalachian Mountains. The fall foliage was past its peak, but it was still wonderful to see. The parking lot was moderately sized, but it was not crowded. The park was near Interstate 64, but it was to the north of it. There were some nice trails to hike, and there were bathrooms, sports fields, a playground, and some places to grill."
Grandview State Park,5.0,Grand Indeed!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Grandview has been upgraded to a portion of New River Gorge National Park since the beginning of 2021, and I am glad its status has been lifted. Some of the best views of the gorge, and certainly the best sunrise I’ve ever seen! The parking lot is massive, and the best view is easy to get to. I hiked 10 miles on the trails in this area, and loved every minute!"
Grandview State Park,5.0,Panoramic,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was in Beckley with a friend and this came up as the #1 attraction.  It was pretty easy to find, had ample parking, but the visitor center was closed so I drove around and found it.  The wooden ramp was covered in snow (hazardous?/maintenance?), but the stone path was clear.  After soaking in the view we explored some of the local trails and rock formations.  This is a good place for some nature therapy."
Grandview State Park,5.0,Best trail in the National Park.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stumbled upon Grandview just driving around and found a gem. We hiked the Castle Wall trail, which was surreal. I felt like I was on a movie set of Lord of the Rings. Castle Wall meets up with the Grandview trail which is scenic, fairly level, and well marked. The trail ends at Turkey Spur with a beautiful view of both sides of the mountain. I had read it's the highest elevation trail in the Park."
Grandview State Park,5.0,Grand Views Indeed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Grandview is a former West Virginia State Park and now part of New River Gorge National River.  Aptly named, the park provides spectacular views of the New River Gorge.  There are three main overlooks connected by the Canyon Rim Trail.  The main overlook is right at a horseshoe bend in the river and is really beautiful.  We also hiked the Castle Rock and Tunnel Trails for some great views of rocky tunnels and towering cliff walls.  Absolutely beautiful place and definitely worth a visit."
Grandview State Park,5.0,Beautiful park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I've been to a few national parks and this is a must see. The grounds are kept in great shape. You can drive to each over look with just a short walk from their. The hiking trails are well marked. The view turkey scrap is amazing.
Grandview State Park,5.0,Beautiful weather & area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful area and the rangers are pleasant. Great trails too and they're still adding more. Take bug spray, and be aware of the potential for wildlife encounters, especially black bears."
Grandview State Park,5.0,Great park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is part of new river gorge national park. Grandview trail is short and easy to see the grand view. We walked the 1 mile rim trail, it was great. There are several lookouts to see the river. "
Grandview State Park,5.0,Best Views of the New River Gorge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Grandview is now part of the National Park Service’s New River Gorge National Park and offers the best views of the New River Gorge.  Be sure to see the view both from the Main Overlook as well as from the Turkey Spur Overlook.  We actually preferred the later but it does take a short walk and some stairs from the rather small parking area at the end of Turkey Spur Road.  There is a view from the parking area but it pales in comparison to the three from the tail, the last one being the best.  There is also a small NPS visitor center here but it is very limited compared the Canyon Rim or Sandstone visitor centers.  The park also offers seven hiking trails of different lengths and degrees of difficulty, nice picnic facilities which we used, a playground, ball field, campground and an amphitheater where the “Hatfields and McCoys” play is presented; but the big draw are the fantastic views of the New River Gorge."
Grandview State Park,5.0,See the Hatfield and McCoys Outdoor Drama,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The only part of the park I know much about is the outdoor theater area. My family has been  to 3 outdoor dramas up there and all were fantastic. The Hatfields and McCoys drama is a must see and a GREAT SHOW. Get the show and dinner. They had some great ribs last time we ate dinner before the drama.
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Excellent Hike with closeup views of Tetons!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"On Jun 6th, I hiked from Jenny Lake Trailhead to the end of Cascade Canyon, via Inspiration Point and Hidden Falls. Cascade Canyon is about 4miles from Inspiration Point."
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Beautiful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The cascade canyon trail is definitely of my favorite hikes I've done! It was about 10 miles round trip and there's spectacular views the entire way. We got to see a moose eating just off the trail and a bear in the distance up on the side of the hill. The scenery is beautiful and pictures don't do its justice! We took the 7am boat ride from across Jenny Lake which was also beautiful and saved some time. I recommend getting there early in the morning since the trail was pretty busy on our way back down.
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Very nice hike!! Narrow and step but worth it.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Pros: great hike and beautiful scenery! Hidden falls, Inspiration Point and then into the  canyon where you'll see the river, and several waterfalls.  We only hiked .5 mile in from Inspiration Point. "
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Beautiful Features!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The falls, lookout and canyon were all beautiful and we saw numerous cascades as well as waterfalls on the opposite peaks. We arrived in the parking lot (go as far as you can down the Visitor Center lot) at 6:30am to make the first boat. A bonus that I didn’t know is that the first boat passengers are charged $10 RT vs the usual $18! We took our time going all the way down the canyon until the junction toward other trails so the falls and outlook were very crowded on our way back and we waited for 4 boats before boarding for the return--we counted on both of these congestions so best to be patient (mostly with rude people who were rushing on the rocky trail at the overlook, much to the dismay of others who needed to take it slower). If you can't do the whole trail, go really early or late enough that the crowds have thinned out. Hiking 3 miles or so (RT) with 500 people wouldn't be my idea of a good time. :)"
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,"Amazing walk, and we saw a bear and cub and a moose",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous walk. we got the ferry across Jenny Lake and then did a long walk up the canyon, it was gorgeous, couldn't stop taking photos of the amazing views. Ferry ride lovely too."
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Really great hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked Clockwise around Jenny lake from visitor center early in the morning in June.  I think it's about 3 miles to Cascade Canyon trail, Don't pass it up. Then get on Cascade Canyon trail which takes you up to the beautiful Hidden Fall's just off the trail. Then start up to Inspiration Point. It's a climb but does not take long. ( be careful with kid's) Beautiful view !  Then keep going up on trail which is easy hiking and to me the best part of trail. Here you are now in the mountain's.   Go early ,It was not many people going up but passed a lot heading back down .Here are some Photo's."
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Fantastic hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I took the 3rd ferry of the day and it was great; the lake was still like glass, smooth ride. A beautiful waterfall (Hidden Falls) is almost right off the ferry landing. A brief but moderately strenuous climb takes you up to Inspiration Point with great views of Jenny Lake. The rest of the canyon is pretty level and has beautiful views of the mountains.  I saw a moose cow and a pika along with plenty of butterflies. The canyon seemed overrun with wild flowers. It was beautiful. On the south side of the canyon about 3/4 of the was to the fork there was a beautiful little waterfall that I didn't see a name for. Plus this is about the only way to actually see the Grand Teton. Many people (including myself) mistake the beautiful teewinot for the grand teton, but you can't actually see it from the main road; you need to get on the trails to get a peek."
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Across the Jenny Lake from the overlook,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Across the Jenny Lake from the overlook are Cascade Canyon, Hidden Falls, and Inspiration Point. Taking the shuttle boat gets one across the lake faster and reduces hiking time. These places are accessible from the Cascade Canyon Trail; part of the Jenny Lake Trail Loop, which goes around the lake and into Cascade Canyon. From there one can go further north to Solitude Lake, or south to the South Fork of Cascade Canyon, and beyond that, to Hurricane Pass, and Schoolroom Glacier. These hikes are rated strenuous."
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Go at 7 AM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Last week of June, parked on a Wednesday at 7 AM, actually walked right onto the shuttle boat with no wait, and had a lovely hike up into the canyon, with only a small number of other hikers.  Hiked down around 11, increasing numbers of people, trail from Inspiration Point to boat dock was tourist hell.  45 minute wait for a boat in hot sun with many line-cutters.  Still worth it."
Cascade Canyon Trail,5.0,Must Do Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a must do hike.  I am from Iowa and not a seasoned hiker, so take that into account when I rate the difficultness of the hike.  We took the ferry over and back to save us 5 miles of hiking.  The beginning of the hike, the hike to Hidden Falls, was a moderate uphill hike.  Not too bad.  The hike to Inspiration Point was a more difficult uphill hike.  It is doable with several water breaks.  We took our time.  Note, there are some places that may cause those with a fear of heights some trouble.  My wife was able to do it and she is not good with heights.  Beyond Inspiration Point is the Cascade Canyon Trail.  At this point begins some easy uphill sections but mostly flat sections back into the canyon.  Most people stop at Inspiration Point and that is the hardest part of this hike.  I strongly suggest another mile or 2 into Cascade Canyon to see some breathtaking views.  Remember, it is all down hill on the way back."
Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,Easy coastal path with great views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We use this trail on road bikes so we can only travel 5.5 miles of it before the road turns into gravel.  This 11-mile roundtrip trail beginning at Pillar point offers a great scenic ride on a twisting paved trail that is great for both bikers and walker/joggers alike.  The trail passes through various beach parks that provide resting spots as well as restrooms.  There is currently a clearly marked detour around a specific bridge repair and riders must take great care when sharing the path with other users.  Riders face the challenge when riding against the wind, but it's otherwise an easy level ride."
Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,Great biking trail along the Half Moon Bay coast,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got the mountain bikes from our hotel to ride along the coast.  This trail runs thru the hotel so a lots of people are using it.  At one point on the trail, the golfers are using it to go from one hole to another.  I think it's unsaved if people are not careful and alert of those carts."
Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,Nice Walk at Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were in Half Moon Bay on a wonderful warm sunny August day.  We enjoyed taking a walk.  Views of the Pacific Ocean were awesome.  Many were there playing in the water, taking a walk, surfing, and more."
Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,Nice quiet walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Did an early morning brisk walk along the coastline during the long weekend. It was quiet and awesome. Did trail walking for a while and switched to sand walking close to the water. Walked all the way to Pillar point harbor. Will do it again
Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,Beautiful Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My husband and I rode our bikes on the trail from the Beach House Hotel to the Ritz Carlton.  Its a flat trail  shared with other bikers and walkers.  The trail is flat and you pass several beautiful beaches.  I will be back!!!
Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I wrote a previous review titled ""One of Half Moon Bay's Best Kept Secrets!"" which is still true, but with explanations. The long bridge that looks so beautiful in the photos is rusted out and collapsed and unsafe at one end. It will be closed until a new bridge can be planned and funded, which unfortunately will take a long time. In the meantime, one can still enjoy the trail by planning ahead and walking a part of the trail north or south of the bridge, which roughly bisects the trail. That still gives you about three or four miles to hike in each direction. If cycling, you can still bike the entire trail by taking the long non-scenic detour inland to the Highway 1 trail between Kelly and Kehoe Avenues to bypass the bridge. Be advised: reviewers who describe the trail as boring clearly have not hiked very much of it, or don't care about viewing wildlife. Along its entire length there is quite a bit of variety. Normally I would choose the southern half as containing my favorite segments, mostly because of the birds and wildflowers. Although not diehard birdwatchers, we carry binoculars to stop and watch the white-tailed (black-shouldered?) kites flying and hovering in pursuit of their next meal of voles or gophers, or the northern harriers dipping and swooping low over the ground, or strings of pelicans cruising the coastline at eye-level along the blufftop. Extremely rarely, you might even see a bobcat or coyote. If you have difficulty walking on unpaved, irregular trails, be advised that the segment from the western end of Poplar St. to the western end of Redondo Beach Rd. is mostly unpaved. The hilliest portion is the southern-most stretch, from Redondo Beach Rd. through the golf course and the grounds of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, and especially south of the Ritz Carlton through the golf course to the southern end of the trail. But the northern half of the trail . . . two days ago we and our greyhounds were hiking the Miramar to Surfer's Beach (just south of the harbor) part of the trail and were treated to the most amazing sight. Thousands of seabirds (gulls, terns, pelicans) were gathered en masse, fishing just offshore due to what must have been huge schools of anchovies or sardines. We are used to seeing pelicans diving for fish in the bay here, or northwest of here in the harbor. But now many of the pelicans were simply floating on the water, dipping their beaks in the water to catch fish among the myriad gulls. But the real treat was to watch a large humpback whale, out beyond the surf break, not only spouting and giving us glimpses of his back as he dove, but coming up head first and showing his head briefly before diving again. We chose a bad day to leave the binoculars and cameras at home! We saw sea lions in the surf as well, and expected to see the dolphins that sometimes show up when there is a seabird feeding frenzy going on, but perhaps they were staying clear of their big cetacean cousin. If you come out to the trail and see two tall humans being walked by four different-colored leashed greyhounds, be sure to say hi!"
Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,One of Half Moon Bay's best kept secrets,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'm always surprised to run into people who love to visit Half Moon Bay but who have never heard of the Coastside Trail.  It runs from a little south of the Ritz Carlton south of town north to Pillar Point Harbor a few miles north of town.  From there, you can wend your way through Princeton-by-the-Sea and pick up the trail that takes you around the marsh to Pillar Point, and the beach north of the point that faces Maverick's, the famous big-wave surf spot a mile offshore.  When the tide is very low there is great tidepooling here; when the tide is very high there are powerful waves and almost no beach.  Most of the trail is paved, but there is a long unpaved (e.g. dirt, rough in some places) section between south of the western end of Poplar Street to the west end of Redondo Beach Road.  From there, the trail is paved again and passes through the golf course and around the coast side of the Ritz Carlton Hotel until the trail ends at a farmer's field at the southern edge of the Half Moon Bay Golf Links.  The coastside trail is open to pedestrians, bicyclists, and leashed dogs. No motorized vehicles. For the southern unpaved portion, mountain bikes are fine but I wouldn't take a road bike there, nor a pedestrian who requires smooth, level surfaces.  In spring and early summer you will see a variety of wildflowers and birds along various parts of the trail.  There is beautiful, changing coastal scenery along most sections.  We live in Half Moon Bay, and walk our three greyhounds on one part of the trail or other several times every week.  Say ""hi"" if you see us!"
Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,Coastside trail near Ritz Carlton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Highly recommend this for people who want a very easy hike along an ocean trail. You can navigate your maps to Ritz Carlton- Half Moon Bay. At the entrance, tell the staff that you are here to see the Coastside Trail. The staff gave me a detailed map (see attached), along with the access code of FREE parking. (Only 25 public parking spaces per day between sunrise and sunset) Signage pointing to coastside trail is very clear. They even have two public restrooms at the spot! The Ritz-Carlton is a very beautiful colonial style building, non hotel guests can walk outside the parameters and take pictures with the garden and lounges outside, it’s such a nice photo spot :)"

Half Moon Bay Coastside Trail,4.5,Bridge closed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sadly, an unthinking State Parks employee drove a tractor over the John Hernandez Bridge, leading to a small section of the bridge collapsing. As a result, our (almost) daily bike rides have been reduced from 8 miles to 4. Since Cal State Parks has no money allocated for repairs, it seems like it will be many months before the bridge is fixed."
Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,A million hermit crabs!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Cabrillo tide pools are fun to visit. We looked at a tide chart, and found out that on the day we were going to visit that the low tide was at 2:00pm. We had seen a very long line into the park a couple of years ago, so we decided to get there about 2 hours before the lowest tide.  It was a great decision- as there was no line to enter the park and we could easily park near the tide pools! (I see that parking could be extremely difficult during low tide.) "
Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,AWESOME way to spend an afternoon!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked along the upper rocks and then spent about four hours (the two hours leading up to low tide and then the two hours after) exploring the tide pools below ...  But we could have kept going! We saw crabs, hermit crabs, a sea star, a couple of sea slugs, a nudibranch, and an octopus! The volunteers roaming around are happy to share their stories/experiences and direct you to areas where you are likely to see something interesting. "
Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,Tide Pools Were Cool !!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We visited Cabrillo Tide Pools and were not disappointed.  The tide pools crash along the rocks and the tides splash heavier than usual at different peak tidal times.  We enjoyed the rock formations and the sunset that shoots over the cliffs.
Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,Natural beauty/rock formations,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I would highly recommend this spot to any nature lover visiting the San Diego area. We checked out the visitor center and went right to the tide pool area. There were some other things we could have seen but we were tired from our flight. The tide pools was phenomenal. We took loads a pictures and you can do a bit of hiking along the water too!
Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,Fantastic experience during low tide,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited the tide pools before, but this time we read an article that talked about visiting the tide pools during low tide. Critters get caught in the crevices and it’s fascinating. You can also walk so much further. "

Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,One of our favorite places,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love Cabrillo Tide Pools.  When my husband was stationed in San Diego with the Navy in the early 80s, it was one of our favorite places.  We returned for a visit to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and could not wait to see the tide pools again. We spent an entire morning walking throughout the area, taking pictures, and enjoying a relaxing time together."
Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,Awesome place to hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Cabrillo National Monument and the tide pool are our favorite place to walk around. Visits this serene place at least once a month using our access pass from National Park Service. Every armed services veterans  can get access pass for free if they have service Donny disability 
Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,Extraordinary Place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Today I took my kids to Cabrillo National Monument. The views are extraordinary with the waves crashing into scenic cliffs. I also liked the walking path as well.  Well worth the price of admission!
Cabrillo Tide Pools,4.5,Great place to take kids!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We spent hours here looking for all the creatures we could find. There were park rangers (?) around while we were there as well and they answered any questions we had and pointed out interesting things to anyone near by them. This was my girls (ages 11 and 13) favorite thing that we did in San Diego!
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,Rewarding views at the top of this summit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started with Beehive at 7am and did Gorham Mountain Trail thereafter, followed by Ocean Path, Thunder Hole, Sand Beach and the full loop around Great Head Trail. The views on this particular trail were beautiful of the ocean. Oh my goodness, pinch me! We parked our rental car in the Sand Beach parking lot. Found restrooms throughout, good signage and all around really enjoyable with an early morning start. Gorham isn’t an easy trail, but reasonable for a family. "
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,Gorgeous as always,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of my favorites in the park… It is our usual afternoon hike on the arrival day because it is not difficult, rather short, and offers stunning ocean views. Another advantage is that it is a coastal trail, so mosquitoes are not too oppressive (they are going wild in the woods at the end of May and June). In the afternoon, it is easier to find parking at Sand Beach and go to the trailhead (when you cross Park Loop Road, you will see the signing post)."
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,beautiful views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail was well marked and not too difficult. We took the quarry path down to start our hike and enjoyed a nice view of the water before getting onto the gorham mountain trail proper. We were hiking probably by 9:30 or 10:00 and it was already pretty busy. There's a lot of rock scrambling, and I definitely wouldn't have been comfortable coming down from the peak without hiking shoes. "
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,Nice easy hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Less crowded than some of the more popular trails, but still go early - the parking lot can fill up by 8am.  The views are different at the faux summit and the true summit - make sure to do both.  Not a strenuous hike by any means.  A fairly easy hike, over granite and through forests.  The views of Sand Beach, Otter Cliffs, the Atlantic, and the surrounding mountains are stunning."
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,Very difficult if you have mobility/stamina issues,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked this trail with my husband and 2 daughters (41 & 20). My husband had asked at the visitors center for a easy hike since I have a disability and due to past medical issues I have not hiked in a while. That being said, this hike was recommended yet it was extremely difficult for me (thank goodness I had trekking sticks).  There are a lot, I mean a lot, of climbing over rocks. And then climbing down rocks. There is no flat places to hike. The views are spectacular and the scenery magical but I was so stressed by trying to complete the hike it was difficult to truly enjoy the journey. My husband had the stressful task of making sure I didn’t fall (I have balance issues and vertigo).  My 20 y/o daughter had no trouble as she was hoping over the boulders. My 41 y/o completed it without to much trouble. Bring extra water and be sure to use sunscreen even though much of the trail is shady. My daughter got a bit of a burn. I rated it a 3, not because of the views and scenery, but because it is a difficult hike if you have some medical/stamina issues."
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,"Solid Location, Moderate Hike",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My suggestion for reaching Gorham Mountain Trail is to take the FREE Island Explorer to Sand Beach. From there, walk Ocean Path to reach Gorham Mtn Trail. If you take the Gorham Mtn Loop (to the parking lot/ bus stop) it will be about 3.5 miles and take 2-3 hours. This is a moderately challenging climb up but not at all scary or treacherous. The views are nice at the top. If you combine Gorham Mountain Trail with either Ocean Path or the Beehive, you will have a full day’s hike."
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,Large flat mountain top with great views in all directions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We would suggest combining a hike up The Beehive (ladders), then over to Gorham Mountain, and Cadillac Cliffs Trail, then back up to your parking spot via the Ocean Trail. The views from the top of Gorham Mountain (525') are lovely. There is some rock/boulder scrambling, but overall the Gorham Trail is moderate."
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,"Sunrise Hike—HIGHLY worth it, not busy",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this as a sunrise hike. The trail was about a mile, and as such only took about a half an hour to reach the summit. Not too hard to do comfortably in the dark. Stop at the false summit to watch the sunrise, since the peak is covered in trees. "
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,Family Favorite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorham Mountain is not among Acadia's most strenuous trails, but it's a wonderful warm up. Great views, and interesting terrain (especially on the Cadillac Cliffs split). Beware that arriving early may be advisable, as parking can be a challenge. For more experienced hikers, Gorham can also be combined with an ascent of the Beehive and/or a hike up the South Ridge of Champlain Mountain, which has wonderful views and passes the Bowl, an excellent place for a mid-day swim."
Gorham Mountain Trail,5.0,Nice hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this as a loop - we parked along the road, walked up Ocean Path to the trailhead, up over the mountain, down the Bowl trail back to the road, then walked the Ocean Path back to the car.  It took less than two hours for 3.5 miles.  It was a relatively easy hike, not too rocky or steep.  There were great views off both sides of the mountain.  There were a fair number of people hiking this.  It was a nice hike."
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Hike to the spectacular Morning Glory Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"FYI this has been renamed as the Grandstaff trail. It's about 5 miles round trip through a very scenic canyon ending at the amazing Morning Glory Arch which I though was as good as anything in nearby Arches NP. The trail gains some elevation but it is not difficult, but be warned that you have to rock hop across a stream 10 times and a few of these crossings are tricky. My husband slipped and got a wet boot which was not good in 20 degree temperature. In winter conditions the trail has packed snow and is icy in spots so spikes are definitely advisable."
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Go early for the trail to yourself,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just outside of Moab, we did this trail at first light (before sunrise) to beat the crowds (that we heard are here).  Did this on a Saturday so another reason to get there early.  There’s a pit toilet there.  We had to walk through about 8-10 streams EACH WAY but all had rocks to help – and I had my hiking poles so didn’t get wet.  It was a lovely hike. You hear the stream most of the hike.  The Morning Glory Natural Bridge (arch) is at the end of the hike.  It’s beautiful there.  We had about 20-30 minutes to ourselves there.  Definitely one of our top hikes in Moab."
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Best hiking experience of our trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We went on a Sunday morning when it was not hot yet.   We arrived at the Arch when people were base jumping down.  The trail itself is gorgeous and goes back and forth over the creek.  We were supposed to go back to the Arches in the afternoon and decided this was better anyway.  
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Nice views but lots of poison ivy and  easy to get off trail.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I arrived someone late in the day so most people were leaving.  It would have been helpful to see the route with others.  I got really off trail a few times and wound up much higher on the rocks than I should have been.  It was just really unclear where the trail went at times.  I enjoyed the multiple creek crossings, although these were spots where it was easy to get off trail as well.  The natural arch/bridge at the end was nice.  I was hiking by myself and didn't want to be lost in the dark so I needed to run out to avoid being there at dusk."
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Fun!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did a lot of hikes in Moab over a week and this was my fave! We went on a sunny day in early November. It was perfect. It did involve crossing the stream a few times but I managed to find places to cross that had rocks to step on. So only the soles of my sneakers got wet, but did require a bit of balance and hand holding. My fiancé had hiking boots on so he wanted to walk thru the water and got his shoes all wet. There was one part that the steps were washed out but another path had been created on the side and just required a few big steps up holding some roots. We met several people of all ages along the way and some with dogs. The reward at the end and the views throughout were worth it. It took us 4 hours, with a bunch of stops for pictures and snacking."
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Favorite trail in Moab ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"First let me say that we did not make it all the way to the end as we had an obligation but we did hike for about an hour and 20 minutes and loved this trail. For the most part it's an easy trail but there are some parts that require maneuvering up and down some rocks so be sure to wear good hiking shoes. Also, expect to get your feet wet as you will cross a stream many times and there aren't always rocks yo get you across dryly. This is a very busy trail - lots of other people and dogs, including hiking groups. It's shaded in a few spots but mostly sunny. Beautiful views.  It's probably our favorite trail in Moab. "
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,So much to see,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a stunning hike with so much variety. Walking along the creek looking up at all the rock formations is truly a fantastic experience. The journey is every bit as good as the destination. The day I was there, a group of rock climbers was repelling from the bridge. This did not add much to my visit but I'm sure it doesn't happen every day. The trail is generally easy but definitely has some tricky parts. People carrying young children and people with mobility difficulties were definitely struggling. Overall, if you did this hike everyday for a year it would be a different hike based on where you placed your gaze along the way. Highly recommend."
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Great Family Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We definitely enjoys this hike.  A little over 4 miles.  Lots of crossing of the river so be prepared to get wet.  There are options for rock jumping but when rocks are wet it gets slippery .  This time of year the waterfall at the end wasn't running but the arch was a nice surprise.  This trail is also great for dogs just start early and the sand will heat up. 
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Very Good ~5 mile hike with payoff views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I are hikers and heard good reviews about it after we enjoyed the delicate arch trail in Arches.  This wasn’t as vertically challenging a hike but still had medium difficulty due to some larger rocks to traverse and some tricky creek crossings.  The payoff views along the way and at the end were worth it + the great workout.
Grandstaff Canyon Trail,4.5,Enjoyable hike next to water!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice hike, I think it took us about 3 hours round trip. Get to walk over the creek multiple times, shoes may get a little wet! The views were very beautiful. I enjoyed watching the crawdads in the water."
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Challenging and beautiful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are not mountain hikers, but we are in our early 50’s and we work out.  After speaking with friends at the hotel who hiked it, we had to try. Knowing that they do rescues on the mountain every week, we took precautions to try to be safe and agreed that if we didn’t feel safe that we would turn back. We had a backpack and had 6 bottles of water.   We only drank 4. It is a climb, not a hike.  We used our hands most of the climb. We started at 6:50 am may 1 and we were thankful for the shade on the whole climb up. I couldn’t have done it in the hot sun. By the time we hit the top the sun had come over the mountain. The sun was fine for the way down. We went slow and took lots of breaks. We only had tennis shoes, so not the best footing but after watching enough experts move quickly up and down the mountain we noticed how they used the rock tops to step instead of the slippery gravel in between the rocks.  The view was spectacular and we are grateful we did it.  "
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Wonderfully challenging,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wonderful challenge. It’s not sooooo hard like some have said. I’m in shape and was with a group of women with varying fitness levels. The first day we went half way and then turned around with the group because everyone felt accomplished without pushing too hard. The next day I went solo (completely safe with ALL the people around) and finished it. Know your limits and be willing to turn around at any point. Take a big bottle of water (32 Oz was great for early morning in June) and wear sunscreen. I wore worn down tennis shoes and certainly wished I had hiking boots a couple of times for the traction, but was totally fine. You will enjoy it!"
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Excellent trail and workout!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Echo Canyon Trail is one of the two popular trails that will get you on the Camelback Mountain. We hiked here on the last weekend of February, when the weather got up to 27C (80F) which meant we needed way more time than anticipated to complete this trail. The trailhead is well marked, there’s facilities incl. water fountains (there are plenty of bees in this area!), and free parking. The trail goes steeply up and up, the terrain is rocky; there are a couple of spots where you may have to be on all fours or hold on to fencing/ railing or whatever you can find to hoist yourself up there. It was quite fun actually, however, with the beaming sun and hot weather, it turned out to be difficult for hubby (bigger guy, we also lacked in form after winter). We ended up taking many breaks and all in all it took us 90 mins to get to the top. Plenty of people on the trail, but it was a Saturday morning and a beautiful day. Saw plenty of beautiful plants including cacti, and many big lizards. The views are very rewarding throughout the trail. The way down from the mountain took us another hour, mainly because we were taking our time to ensure we don’t fall on the big boulders. Total time 2.5 hours, and a challenging but very doable beautiful trail. Highly recommended! Take more water than you think you’ll need, and good hiking boots."
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Great outdoor gym substitute during Covid times,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Really good workout for the quads.  There are two levels to the parking lot, but the parking is a bit limited.  There was adequate availability at 0630 on a Sunday morning.  "
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Take Difficulty Seriously ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice free parking area with restrooms. A box of bananas and warnings gave us the clue that this hike was not for the casual stroller. Things started out gradual with a slightly inclined sandy trail but soon it moved to a staircase and then it became more of a bouldering exercise navigating up a rock face - some times there was a metal railing to grip on to. There are a few views prior to the trail getting really steep but it was a lot more intense than any of us expected despite the number of warnings. Still, a beautiful place to go and try out your endurance. "
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Challenging and rewarding,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Excellent trailhead facilities with restrooms, water, and parking. Summer has plenty of parking but busy season is almost impossible. It took about 45 minutes to reach the summit and about 35 to decend back down. It can be challenging so do not recommend if this is one of your first times hiking trails. Bring water bottles. "
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Tough Climb but You don’t have to be a pro ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were concerned bc of mixed reviews on what to expect with this trail. We’re not “pro hikers” or in phenomenal shape, but rather just like to adventure and challenge ourselves on trips. I’ll try to talk to those folks like us. "
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and two children (6 and 10 years old) hiked this on New Years Day. Started out around 10 in the morning. Parking lot had gotten quite full by then, when we pulled up they just were letting a few more cars in. Hike was beautiful. Very different from the Piestawa Peak trail we had done the day prior. Glad we hiked in the morning as the end of the hike we were already getting warm. Lots of spots along the way up to the summit to sit aside to have a break and snacks. View from summit was beautiful. This hike was a great workout. I was hesitant from reading other reviews about taking my kids on it but they handled it better than the adults did I think at times! :)"
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,Hiking up Camelback Mountain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Just did this hike up Camelback Mountain with a colleague. It was one of the rare days where the sky was cloudy. Pretty humid though so no typical Phoenix conditions. During the week there was ample parking space for our morning hike. Lots of people already on the trail. Takes around an hour either way if you are reasonably fit. Not suitable for people who are not used to using their hands from time to time. It's pretty much an ascent rather than a hike. Water is really important. The view from the top is awesome. You should definitely do it when in the Valley of the sun.
Echo Canyon Trail and Recreation Area,4.5,"It's a challenge, but if I can do it, you can do it.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was really challenging. It gets narrow in a few spots, but it's doable and people are friendly and take turns. Take at least one bottle of water. I took two and drank one-and-a-half bottles in about eighty degree weather. There are no restrooms along the way, so go at the bottom of the hill before you begin your climb. It gets progressively steeper going up. There were moments I wasn't sure I could make it, but you can do it. If I can do it, you can do it. Definitely worth the burning muscles once you're resting at the top and taking in that view."
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,Favorite but Crowded,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wow, it was crowded but this was my favorite trail.  DO NOT GO BACK DOWN THE STEPS!  Go up the steps and then past Nevada Falls take the John Muir trail down.   There will be less people on the John Muir trail and you'll have magnificent views.   The park rangers should make this trail one way.  if everyone was headed the same direction you wouldn't have to wait in the narrow parts of the steps.  It would be much safer."
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,Best hike in Yosemite!  Don't even debate it; just do it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Nevada Falls loop is PHENOMENAL!  The hike is a bit strenuous (there are sections with some steep stairs), but it is totally worth it.  You get great views of both sets of falls (Vernal Falls, then Nevada Falls).  "
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,Scenic and challenging hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Nevada Falls Loop is a nine mile hike with about 2,000 feet of elevation.  The major sites are the Vernal Falls and the Nevada Falls, as well as scenic vistas over the Yosemite Valley.  It's a long, steep hike, but the trail and the footing are good throughout.  The key to the hike is to make sure you take the John Muir loop trail from the Nevada Falls.  I realized this only after going back down the steps past the Falls, squeezing past hikers climbing up the narrow path and wreaking havoc on my knees trying to traverse the hundreds of steep steps on the way down."
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,Hiking poles would help!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I are 40 and in average shape. We found the climb doable, but the route back down was harder (probably because we were tired). Our hiking poles were accidentally left behind, and I wish we had them, as it would have taken pressure off our legs. We opted to come down the John Muir trail and it was steep, hot, and we were tired! The views were the best on the way up, so take your time and savor them. The views were worth all the hard work, but I would hesitate to do this hike again unless I prepared with training. "
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,Good Detour off the Panorama,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had hiked up 4-mile trail and were on our way down on the Panorama. We were tired, but later glad we took the detour to Nevada Falls.  The falls are very cool and you get a unique viewpoint from the top of the falls that you don't get with most of the other falls in the park."
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,One of the top hikes anywhere,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I (in our mid-50s) hike frequently.  We have walked in many countries and many states.  For a relatively short walk close to civilization, this trail has to be one of the best anywhere -- certainly it offers the most spectacular views per mile walked!"
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,Stunning hike up to Nevada falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are experienced hikers and the trail is marked strenuous. I’d say it was moderate if you’re used to hill walking. We parked at Curry village car park and took the shuttle for a couple of stops to the trail head, starting the hike around 8.30am. The hike up to Vernal falls on the mist trail, followed by Nevada falls, returning on the John Muir trail took about 5 hours which included lots of photo stops and a lunch stop at the top. Take plenty of water and pack food in ziplock bags so the wild animals don’t get attracted to it! Wear hiking shoes, not trainers and take sunscreen. The views are incredible"
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,Worth it. Bring plenty of water and a lunch.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this trail on the last day of June, and luckily for us, the falls were still glorious. This hike took us a total of about six hours, including a few twenty minute breaks and an 45-60 lunch break. We had a couple of litres of water each, plus bottles of Gatorade, plus our lunches. The sign at the bottom recommended 3 litres of water per person, and you shouldn't count on refilling unless you have a solid way to purify water.  Fortunately, we left well hydrated. We left a little later than we would have preferred, just before 8:00 am, but 7:00 would have been better.  If you have a choice between hiking boots and sneakers, boots are absolutely the way to go, you won't regret their weight on this trek. "
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,15 tips for enjoying the Nevada Falls Loop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"1.  For those people who want more of a challenge than doing the Mist trail up to the top of Vernal Falls, there is the hike to the top of Nevada Falls."
Nevada Falls Loop,5.0,Do this hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,You get to see Vernal Falls and Nevada falls.  Beautiful scenery along the way.  Go up the Mist Trail and down the John Muir trail so you don't have to navigate the rocky steps all the way down. Took a total of about 6 hours to do the whole hike including a 30-40 min rest at the top of Nevada falls and lots of stops for pictures on the way up.
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,Good for walking/running narrow for bikes,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We parked and paid for parking at the San Clemente Metrolink Station at the north end of trail. We were riding our E-Bikes. Wasn’t a weekend thankfully but there was plenty of morning Walker/runners. It’s only about 2 miles or so long and lots of it is between fences/railing and its narrow. We just casually ride and not fast at all but it wasn’t a relaxing ride having to steer around or stop to try and get around people. It follows and crosses the Metrolink line.
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,Great place to escape to on a touristy holiday.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Caught train from Anaheim to San Clemente station and then walked to San Clemente Pier (and station). Really nice walk. We did this on a sunny day in January/winter, around midday, and it was the perfect temperature - not too hot, but certainly not cold. Really is a nice place to get away too, especially if you're in the Anaheim area as it was less than an hour by train, and felt good to get out of the theme park crowds for a day. Nice restaurants at the pier, too, to relax and enjoy the sea air before returning to Anaheim."
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,beautiful walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked the pier and the coastal trail Saturday morning.  It took a long time to find parking, but it was worth it. From the pier, we saw people fishing, whale watching, and surfing.  On the coastal trail, we saw magnificent mansions perched on cliffs, interesting vegetation, people walking their dogs, riding their bikes, jogging/walking their babies, sunbathing,  and playing beach volleyball. The Amtrak train arrived during our walk. I would love to come back and eat at one of the nearby restaurants and maybe tour Casa Romantica."
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,No Dogs Allowed,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful hard packed sand trail that I have walked many times over the past 10+ years. However, yesterday, 7/14/ 2021 there were ""No Dogs on Trails"" signs up which I didn't notice until I was half through the trail. Luckily, animal control wasn't waiting for me at the end."
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,The best walk starts with the first step!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A great way to start my morning is a nice walk and it does not get much better then this! Along the ocean front Boardwalk of San Clemente from North to South is about a 2.3 mile walk, bike ride or jog. Its quit popular with the locals also. Bring your beach supplies cause you will want to stay."
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,Great path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This path is nicely kept and is compacted sand. It goes along the ocean and gas plenty of benches and umbrellas to rest and/or have a picnic. The path goes right by the pier which is a nice side visit. You can take your 4 legged friend on the path but not on the pier. This would be a nice place to see the a sunrise or sunset.
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,Delightful path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ideal for either a brisk walk or a stroll starting at the pier and walking south.  Many people with strollers, friendly dogs, and joggers.  Bikers also respectful of space.  Perfect trails along a gorgeous beach.  Well maintained."
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,A wonderful  hike along  the Pacific Ocean,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Park at the parking lot where Pacific Coast Highway heads into  San  Clemente and turns into Camino Real.
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,Miles of Fabulous Surf and Ocean Views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lovely place for a walk, stroll, jog along the beach.  The trail is mostly open.  Between El Portal and Mariposa, the bridge over a sensitive beach habitat is closed.  However, you can zig zag down onto the sand and keep going.  At low tides, the area is passable.  Be careful at high tide!  Round trip, the trail is over 4 miles.  "
San Clemente Coastal Trail,4.5,Great exercise ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great trail for easy to moderate level of difficulty.   Moderate only in the sense of distance.  I walked from North Beach to Cottons Point.  6.86mi. 2hrs.  So moderate exercise. Any way one segments the trail to their needs would be easy and the entire experience great.  Ocean front, obviously, several restrooms Along the way, and even couple snack shacks.  "
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,"No falls, tough hike",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The granite ""stairs"" are a misnomer. One crawls over boulders, steeply uphill, only to be rewarded w/a faucet leak. Hopefully winter snow melt will make a Spring climb worthwhile. The biggest bummer, surprisingly, was the horde of people on an early weekday in latter Oct.! coupled w/the large # NOT wearing or even carrying masks as they passed on narrow, rocky path. "
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,Amazing hiking trail to falls & lake with spectacular views.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Longtime Tahoe visitor for life. Done Eagle Falls trail many, many times over years' with our kids growing up and continue every summer. IMPORTANT - get there early ! [as limited parking along highway other than small parking lot]."
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,Upper and lower falls a must,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Eagle falls has 2 falls, the upper and lower and it is in your best interest to see both of them. You can continue on up to the lake but it is going to be a good hike to get there and you will need a free permit day pass to do it. You do not need a pass just to see the falls. It is a short hike to the upper falls and well worth your time. Parking is going to be the biggest obstacle so plan accordingly. "
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,Many steps uphill,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My friends and I did the upper eagle falls trail pretty early on in our trip, and in theory this was a perfectly nice hike. We were there on the 4th of July weekend so everything was packed. We had parked along the highway at some point near Emerald Bay and were just walking the highway to various hikes and vistas. The lower falls looked very popular with families in their bathing suits splashing in the water."
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,Disappointing,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went to visit this place in early September, and I guess that is a little too late, if you want to see the actual falls.  Its a short hike, but be prepared to walk on an uneven trail which are rocky and sometimes a bit challenging.  But we were disappointed once we got to the actual falls because its more of a trickle than an actual falls.  So we will try again maybe in early spring, once the snow started to melt."
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,Nice hike but get there early!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Weekends are very busy. Plan to get there by at least 7:30-8 am to get a parking spot. The hike itself can be a little challenging if you're not used to the elevation. There were ""stairs"" on part of it, some were pretty steep. But once you get to Eagle Lake, it's worth it.  People are good about social distancing and mask up when they pass. There is a little ""swimming"" hole about halfway up by the bridge."
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is a family tradition every year.  It is an easy hike up to the beautiful eagle lake.  Stop along the way and soak in the beauty.  Go Early!!!!!!!!! not only because it gets hot in the afternoon, but also because there are so many people and it can get crowded and parking is bad.."
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful falls  / short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The hike to the Falls is short and sweet. It's a good way to see a lot of beauty in nature.  If you keep going you get to Eagle Lake.  I recommend the full hike to Eagle Lake and back if you can do it.  Parking is a factor- we parked on the road but watch the signs.
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,Eagle Falls & Eagle Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was recommended by a fellow traveler and offers stunning views. Along the trail you can see and overlook Eagle Falls. If you have more time to spend, continue on to Eagle Lake for a swim. It's totally worth it! Many fantastic mountain ridges and views!"
Eagle Falls Trail,4.5,A must do hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What a scenic hike down to Emerald Bay Area.  Hike down was on a wide paved path which mead it easy…slower going back up! Worth the trip down and then explored the paths around the waters edge.
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,Rugged,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Thhis is a very rugged and long trail. Make sure your weari;ng good hiking or very sturdy athletic shoes and take a small backpack with protei;n snacks lots of water.
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,Memorial Day Weekend Hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I went on Memorial Day weekend (Sunday) and it was pretty packed. The parking lot, which don’t have a lot of parking in it anyway, was over flowing. We had to park in a mud hole off on the side and do some acrobatics getting out of the car. About a quarter of a mile up the trail you come to a river crossing where I think a bridge used to be (maybe)? But it’s not there so you cross what looks like a beaver dam. I’ll post a pic of the crossing. I’d suspect people fall in alot. After that it was a typical hike up to the falls. There were beautiful views and other smaller falls. There were lots of trees down so we crawled over or under all the trees that were on the trail. It’s 2.5 miles up to the falls, waking beside the creek almost the whole way, and we were able to do the round trip in 3 and a half hours."
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,Beautiful falls great hiking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great area for hiking with several water falls along the way.  The hike is 5 miles round trip if you make it to the top.  It’s rated easy but you have to be in good physical condition to make it to the top and NO everything is easy.  It’s mostly up the hill with rocks, tree branches and roots on the way... but you don’t have to make it to the top to enjoy it.  The best waterfalls are on the way.  It took us 1 1/2 hour to make it to the top waking at a good pace no slow but no super fast either.  To come back we took only one hour but we were jogging for a while plus going down is easier.  The water is cold but it’s a welcome feeling since you do sweat going up.  In overall we really loved the hiking and wish we had more time to enjoy some of the waterfalls we saw along the way."
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,"Great hike, can be a bit challenging ",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was nice following the water along the way with some other smaller falls along the way.  We thought we were to the end and I wondered where the falls from the cliff were?  Then someone told us to go to go up the embankment  and we would see them which we then did.  It’s a bit steep you have to climb some rocks to get to where the falls are visible.  Disappointing to see someone had used one of the rocks as a toilet.  Like really can’t you bury it or be less conspicuous?  On the way down saw families with young kids (under 5) traveling up, they might not get to see the actual falls through the cliffs.  "
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,nice trail with view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is very nice and easy, basically no elevation gain till close to the end of the trail. The water level is high, so the creek was clean and with plenty of water. Parking space is very limited, hard to find spot, Senior pass is acceptable. I climbed to half at the end, just to the point where I could see the falls in its entirety. "
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,Great hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a fun hike. Kid friendly. 5.8 miles total. The best part was the end. If you go up the hill for another minute at the end of the official trail, there is a great view of the cliffs. The parking lot fills up fast sometimes, you might want to get there earlier in the day. Also there is a $5 fee per vehicle."
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,"Beautiful View, long hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I (31 and 25) hiked this and it was about a 5 mile round trip. It’s not a paved trail, lots of roots and rocks. There’s a beautiful view of the creek and some smaller falls pretty much the whole way there. There isn’t much to the actual raven cliff falls. It’s beautiful and tall but it’s very narrow. There is a small spot at the bottom of the waterfall where you can swim if you want, but if there are several people there it’s kinda awkward to get in it with others bc it’s not a big swimming hole. If hiking 5 miles isn’t much to you, then it’s worth it, but if not there are some really beautiful falls along the way and you can turn around at any point. We really enjoyed stopping and walking down to the creek to get a better view of the small falls and climbing the rocks. It took us about 2.5-3 hours with all of our stops bc we were enjoying the beauty!"
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,Unexpected river crossing,3.0 of 5 bubbles,The bridge is out so you have to cross the river. Not my ideal surprise in January when I was trying to squeeze a fast hike in before picking the kids up from school. I wish there had been some signage that indicated this before I paid the parking fee. I walked a quarter mile in and then had to turn right back around. I’ll come back in the spring or summer when I don’t mind splashing through rivers.
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,Easy to moderate 5.25 mile beautiful hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The trailhead is easily marked and it is a moderate round trip 5 mile hike.  You are constantly seeing water as the trail follows the creek which leads to watering holes and waterfalls.  The falls are not as spectacular as Dukes Creek but you are able to get into the creek and explore the falls very close.  No trash bins or bathrooms on the trail.  The trail is easily marked and it has lots of roots so it’s not stroller friendly.   It was an enjoyable experience and the elevation change was minimal.
Raven Cliff Falls,4.5,Great outing -- watch out for broken glass after fording creek,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"You don't have to go the whole way to enjoy the beautiful river and small falls along this shady trail. If you remove your shoes to ford the shallow creek (about 5-10 minutes in), be careful where you stand after crossing. Looked like some broken glass near one of the logs west of the creek. Hiking poles a good idea due to lots of roots. There was a very manageable flat log to cross about 20 minutes after the creek. The trail is a bit narrow and parking is limited, so go early and enjoy!"
Landscape Arch,4.5,Another awesome arch to visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was pleasantly surprised on how many awesome arches there are in this park.  It is worth noting that if you don't want to take the hike to Delicate Arch, there are still many arches that are worth visiting with easy hikes.  The Landscape Arch is one of them.  As a bonus, the Landscape Arch is not crowded because most of the people hike to the Delicate Arch."
Landscape Arch,4.5,Landscape Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose to drive to the back of Arches National Park to the Devils Garden Trailhead area after entering early in the morning. This area has a large parking lot and we were easily able to get a spot. When we started hiking the weather was cool but it warmed up quickly as there is not much shade on the trail to Delicate Arch. The hike is relatively short, well maintained and a very popular route. You can’t get too close but it was certainly worth seeing this highlight of the park."
Landscape Arch,4.5,Lovely Fragile Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This arch can be viewed through a partial or full hike of the Devil's Garden Trail at the far end or Arches National Park. If you do the partial its roughly a mile in and a mile back for a two mile round trip. We hiked this in the evening and there were certainly areas of shade to go along with the stunning canyon views along the trial. Small wildlife can be seen along the trial. The trail travels through several fins which are interesting in and of themselves and little bit different from the typical rock formations in the park. There are some area of steep elevation gain but they are short. The trail itself is well groomed and wide - it is also well travelled and solace at least up to 
Landscape Arch,4.5,"One mile in, one mile out",5.0 of 5 bubbles,Just do it!
Landscape Arch,4.5,Easy stroll - Arches Must!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Landscape Arch is impressive and is well worth the mile hike from the Devil’s Garden Trailhead parking lot. It’s not really a hike just a pleasant stroll. Just take water. It’s a desert and can get hot. We elected to go to the Landscape, Pine Tree and Tunnel Arches. These are on the same easy loop. More ambitious hikers can go further on the primitive trail but we elected to wimp out."
Landscape Arch,4.5,Very special and worth the hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the most fragile arches in the park and as such you can't actually get to it, but the trail leads you along the sand to a perfect viewpoint where the arch is highlighted by the blue sky behind it."
Landscape Arch,4.5,Probably #2 Rated Arch in the Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Delicate and Landscape Arches make up the two most popular and visited in the park.
Landscape Arch,4.5,Another beautiful arch — easy to get to,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Probably my second-favorite arch (following the iconic Delicate arch) in the Park. It is a lengthy slim one and very photogenic. You have to start at the Devils Garden trailhead, and is about one mile long (each way). Easy hike with little elevation change."
Landscape Arch,4.5,So cool!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is my 2nd favorite site in Arches after Delicate Arch. It is so cool to see this long, narrow arch that is longer than a football field. And it's an easy hike that is not far from the Devils Garden trailhead."
Landscape Arch,4.5,More of Nature's Beauty.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This Arch is in Devil's Garden.  It is a bit longer hike than some of the other Arches.  It looks older and more weathered with a smaller arch nearby.  If you are prepared, you can hike futher past to see additional arches.  We turned around as it was our second day of hiking and scrambling and adding 2 miles to the hike wasn't appealing at the time.  We did see a deer close to the path and the scenery was breathtaking.  It is windy with sand.  A good sun hat will protect you from the sand as well as the sun."
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went to the Dark Angel via the Primitive trail and looped back by the Double Arch back towards the trail head, with detours for the Navajo arch and Partition arch.  The landscape is beyond stunning, as you can see from peoples' photos. If you are on your own and on a week day, it's probably a good idea to have a GPS app, as not all the trail turns are obvious.  If you decide to take the Primitive loop I recommend you go counterclockwise, as some of the sketchier places are probably easier (or rather, safer) to go up than down - ie, take the right turn when you get to the Landscape arch.  You'll see many arches, and breath-taking formations.  An experience of a lifetime."
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,Gorgeous Garden,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Devil's Garden is located at the very back of the Arches scenic loop. The formations almost look like the backbone of a huge beast. The trailhead has a large parking area with restrooms. The way the light refracts off the sides of the close formations makes for great pictures.
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,"I Recommend Going to Landscape Arch, but Don’t Waste Your Time on this Trail if Your Time at Arches NP is More Limited.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was actually shocked that this popular trail doesn’t have a dangerous and deadly reputation past Landscape Arch, considering the fact that there are relatively narrow slick rock fins with deadly dropoffs on either side of the trail. There’s also a lot of sand covering the rocky and steep areas of the trail to make the trail even more slippery and potentially dangerous. I  saw multiple foolish people climbing up steep fins off the trail that would be a deadly fall if those people fell. So I was surprised that I hadn’t heard about fatalities on the Devils Garden Trail. The arches on the trail are awesome. However, there are better and shorter trails in the park to see a greater concentrations of arches that are just as spectacular, if not more so. I would recommend hiking to at least to Landscape Arch. Past Landscape Arch I wouldn’t recommend the trail if your time at the park is more limited. Go elsewhere in the park to see more arches once you get to Landscape Arch if your time is kind of limited. Most importantly I would not recommend this trail at all to anyone past Landscape Arch if you’re afraid of heights."
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,"Devil's Garden is Difficult, not Moderate and certainly not easy",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"For avid, experienced hikers in good shape and without fears of heights, Devils Garden seemed to be a hiking paradise, based on the conversations we had with people on the trail. We talked with people (most in their 20s and 30s) coming from the direction we were headed because we were either lost or concerned about the difficulty ahead. "
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,Great Arches Quality and Quantity ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the Arches MUST SEE and hike is the Devil's Garden trail.  The Devil's Garden is a series of fins on a ridge which have eroded to create some of the best arches in the park like Landscape Arch.  However, if you are simply looking for quantity of arches, this is your place as there are some many arches of all types.  In addition it is a great hike.  There is a section as you ascend to the top portion of the trail where you climb up the ridge of a fin.  This is where our party split as some wanted to continue on while others were uncomfortable.  I kept going and was rewarded with some amazing views.  This is a great part of the park and an Arches NP Must See.  "
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,Devils Garden Trailhead,5.0 of 5 bubbles,On our visit to Arches National Park we arrived early to try to beat the crowds and drove straight to the back of the park to the Devils Garden Trailhead area. The large parking lot made it easy to find a spot. We had planned to hike to Delicate Arch but once we started on the primitive trail we were having so much fun that we continued to Double O Arch. On the way back we also saw Navajo and Partition Arch. We ended up spending several hours here and had lunch at the picnic area that shares the same parking lot.
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,A Rewarding 6 Mile Jaunt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great way to see about 6 different arches on a round trip six mile hike.   You can get to 3 arches including (Landscape Arch) if you want a shorter 2.8 mile walk.
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,"Be sure to visit this area, but don’t hike with kids",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was a dry and bright day when we visited, but based on reviews we did not want our children hiking these trails.  We walked some of the flat trail head areas of Devil’s garden. Devil’s Garden was beautiful what we saw of it.  We then had lunch in Devil’s Garden which had covered picnic areas and restrooms. This was a gorgeous area of the park"
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,"Thursday, February 2nd morning hike.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I arrived to the trailhead around 9:45am.  There were only a couple of vehicles in the parking lot.  There was a restroom available.  It was quite chilly when we started.  The trail surface was dry, muddy, snowy, and icy.  We wore our traction devices for part of the hike.  We do hike with trekking poles. we went straight out and kept left at the primitive trail turnoff loop to the right.  We hiked to a bit beyond the Position Arch, and Navajo Arch spurs.  At that point we came to a very high, skinny ridge.  We could not see too far along the ridge to see what faced us at the end.  So between the snow, ice, and high winds, we decided to bail on going any further, and headed back.  Then visiting the pine tree arch, and the tunnel arch, before making it back to the lot.  When we got back to the lot, there were quite a few cars.  We really had a nice time, and the arches were wonderful.  I would love to try this hike again in dry conditions."
Devils Garden Trailhead,4.5,Lots of Fun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful!! The only thing that makes this hike challenging is the heat, otherwise it's pretty chill with amazing views. We started at about 8:30 in late July and it took around 4 hours including a break for lunch. Wish we had started earlier because the last couple miles were brutally hot. Lots of scrambling, slippery slopes and tons of fun. Pack a cooler in the car for something to look forward to!"
The Window Trail,4.5,The sight of the “Window” is worth the effort,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fairly easy out and back trail (5.6 miles total).  The only hard part is you have to go downhill all the way first and the return is all uphill.  But the incline is not that steep.  The view of the ""window"" (more like a ""doorway"") at the end is worth the effort.  Last quarter mile of the trail is interesting and rocky with some steps carved into the rocks. Rocks at the pour off opening are very slippery so be sure not to get too close to the edge as it's a sheer drop.    "
The Window Trail,4.5,Go Early!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We set off on the trail at 7:45am and only saw people on our return on a Friday morning (Lost Mine Trail on Saturday already many on the trail by 8:00am). We had the view to ourselves and did not have to jockey for photos. It is very slick by the window but we felt pretty safe getting fairly close (actual harder trying to get  back out of the area due to the slickness of the rocks). I am 60 and did not feel the hike  was too strenuous. This was not our favorite hike in the park but definitely in the top three. We parked by the Chisos campground and there is designated trail parking! The trail starts between 49 -51 sites) and there is a great bathroom not far from the start. Supposedly starting from the campground helps avoid some of the uphill part. Also it’s much less chaotic than starting near the visitors station ( we stopped afterwards and lots of people setting off). Note: there ARE bears on the trail. We saw one at the very end of the hike!  Enjoy!
The Window Trail,4.5,"Definitely not “easy” for most non hikers, but worth the effort!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I’m triggered by this being called an “easy, quick walk”. Definitely worth it, but it’s all incline on the way back! If you aren’t super active on the stair stepper & cardio before you go, the hike back is gonna hurt. Go plenty early so you can take the way back at your own pace. The last .1 mile involves steep stone steps with no hand rails or barriers (obviously) so if you are clumsy or scared of falling, this part may be a challenge for you. All that said, The Window is BEAUTIFUL and this was such a cool trail. We saw bears! The views are stunning the entire hike."
The Window Trail,4.5,"Good Calf Workout, Great Views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,We really enjoyed this hike.  I have read several people complaining that it isn't a loop and you have to hike the same trail back.  But it is in a beautiful area with unique views and that completely makes up for it not being a loop!  
The Window Trail,4.5,P I C T U R E. this. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Know before you go. Rangers strongly monitor this trail when busy / in hot weather. They warn you off the trail before sunset. Bring more water than you expect. You easily hike down to the Window and exhaustingly trudge (essentially a mile long staircase) back up.  Park at the campground to shorten that climb. 
The Window Trail,4.5,2 worthwhile hours,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hike. Wasn't very difficult and didn't take very long (3 miles out and 3 miles back took us 2 hours). The return is mostly uphill. We saw goats on our return. We were there during peak season and had no problem parking in the lot by the store in Chisos Basin area.
The Window Trail,4.5,early november hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"beautiful trail! we went in the afternoon in early November and it was definitely warm in the sun, but cool in the shade (which there was quite a bit of on this trail). Downhill on the way in and uphill allllll the way back so get ready! it was easy for myself and my boyfriend however we do cardio regularly at home. I will say there was a significant amount of yellowjackets at the window, which I have never been on this hike before so I don't know if this is normal or not. They were generally minding their own business but something to keep in mind if you are allergic to stings."
The Window Trail,4.5,Another 3-hour tour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We made the hike starting from the Chisos Mountain Lodge parking lot. You can save yourself a mile of walking down switchbacks if you start from the campground parking lot below the lodge. 
The Window Trail,4.5,Butterflies everywhere. Great hike with impressive changes in vegetation and scenery.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The diversity in flora and fauna from the start to the finish was amazing.  We parked at the campground to shave about 300 ft of vertical off the hike and were glad we did.  You start in typical desert and hike down along a wash that turned into a stream.  There were butterflies everywhere and a broad diversity of trees and plants due to the stream.  The trees provided nice shady spots to just sit and listen to the birds and critters in the bushes.  Towards the end of the hike, you end up in a canyon with man made stairs to get you through the tough parts.  The views are fabulous.  There was a tarantula on the wall at the bottom so watch where you put your hands.  If you have time for only one hike, it is a tough choice between this one and Lost Mine."
The Window Trail,4.5,Our Favorite Hike in Big Bend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is a moderate hike of 5.6 miles round trip from the Chisos Basin Lodge area to the Window pour-off. Going to the Window is downhill. The return of course is uphill. A volunteer at the visitor center suggested that we take this hike in the morning to reduce the sun and heat on return leg. The scenery is beautiful and varies from the lodge area to the wooded area to the rocky scrabble & steep walls near the Window. There are some concrete steps cast into the rocks to make some areas easier. Most of the stream areas were dry except after the trail splits between Oak Spring and the Window. The view at the Window is amazing. Great place to grab some rest, a snack and a drink before the uphill return. It took us three hours of hiking (RT) plus a 30-minute break at the Window pour-off."
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Wow!  What an experience!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"All in all, riding the entire GAP from Pittsburgh to Cumberland with my husband over a 5-day period (4 days of actual riding) was a phenomenal experience. I absolutely loved seeing the landscape transition from urban to suburban to rural. The abundance of nature and the vistas were nothing short of spectacular. The innkeepers we encountered were welcoming, gracious hosts. The grade, though not steep, was a bit challenging at times, and I definitely recommend padded shorts. The one real disappointing aspect was the fact that some of the restaurants along the way were closed, and therefore food and beverage choices were limited. In Ohiopyle, two out of three restaurants were closed on the same day. If you enjoy an adult beverage at the end of your ride, you might consider packing some of your own. As stated, though, the good far exceeds the not-so-good."
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,GAP and C&O bicycle touring adventure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My Salsa Vaya touring bike worked well on the ""GAP""'s 148.8 miles, and we had no rain! Met some great people cycling the trail. You need to plan and book accomodations in Jan or Feb to ride in September. The trail is shaded by trees most of the way, and the trail surface is mostly crushed gravel.  We continued on after the GAP and did the 184 mile C&O Toepath trail...but that was a whole other story. Detours, very bumpy (rocks, tree roots, mud) conditions most of the way, and towns along the way that required uphill switchbacks and uphill roads, and poorly maintained outhouses put a tiny dent in our overall great riding experience. These 2 connecting trails took us from Pittsburgh to Washington DC. A must ride for touring enthusiasts!!"
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Great place to ride a bike or hike.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have ridden the GAP many times.  I enjoy the well packed and maintained trail. During the summer of 2023 there is some construction at the beginning in Cumberland but very passable, "
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Thanks to all the volunteers & groups that make the GAP GREAT!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a beautiful, well maintained trail. You could see how much effort goes into the upkeep, not to mention the costs. THANK YOU for all those who worked to make it happen and those who keep it up- a wonderful socially-distanced vacation experience that I would do again and highly recommend! "
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Great trail and well maintained,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So impressed how well maintained this trail was.  All 150 miles I rode  no major pot holes, garbage , etc.  Also good signage and mile markers.  Even when going through towns where the trail seemed to cutoff it was easy to follow- no pulling over and guessing.  Same goes for all the tunnels - well maintained.  The Big Savage Tunnel (my favorite) while dark, long and the motion sensor lighting was a bit delayed it was also clean and well maintained.  No sudden bumps or random debris.  Plenty of water and bathrooms along the trail.  Ohiopyle was a great stop to spend the night.  I stayed at the Ohiopyle Suites (right off the path) and dined at the Falls City Restaurant and Pub.  Had good food and a well deserved cold beer.  You can walk anywhere in this small inviting town.  "
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Awesome well-maintained trail.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started in Connellsville and went up (2% grade) approximately 17 miles to Ohiopyle and back, Ohiopyle to Fort ? And back, then Rockwood to Meyersdale and back, then Meyersdale over the gap to Frostburg and back.   Wonderful trail, mostly canopied, wildlife, views, places to eat.   Great trip.  We will be going back, and will combine with rafting in Ohiopyle."
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Bike the GAPCO,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I bike all over the world and the GAPCO trail which is a combo of the Great Alleghaney Passage and the C&O canal is incredible. We took the train to Pittsburg spent the night and then road about 40 miles each day along the Great Allegheny Passage spending the night in incredible hotels or B&B and having great meals. In Cumberland you pickup the C&O canal and it is amazing going all the way to Washington . So you can the train from Washington to Pittsburg and ride all the way back and it is totally safe and great hotels & B&B along the way  
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Enjoyable bike ride,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rode the portion of the Great Allegheny Passage from Frostburg to the Eastern Continental Divide. Although most of the rails to trails we ride in PA  are asphalt, the ride here is mostly smooth stone (crushed limestone). It slowed us down a little but we had the whole day to waste. It was a slight uphill journey but a very interesting one. The Mason-Dixon line was neat and the views near the Big Savage Tunnel were awesome. Only complaints were the young couple walking the 4 dogs near the divide were leaving their dogs waste on the trail as they walked and older gentleman than almost ran head-on into my husband in the ""lighted""  tunnel."
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Access points everywhere ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The GAP trail runs the route of the old Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. There are numerous access points for a short walk with your dogs or bicycle  on the trail. This reviews for Sutersville access point. All level and plenty of free parking.
Great Allegheny Passage,5.0,Cumberland to Frostberg and Back,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nicely maintained packed gravel trail.  Slight grade up for the 16 miles to Frostberg.  Mostly shaded in the morning.   Awesome cruising on the way back!   Have lunch at the Princess Cafe in Frostberg.  Had a very nice day.
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Beautiful views but sad you can't swim,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Really nice views at this lake on both sides of access area, is nice that it's so quiet and just a few paddlers and kayakers.  No kayaking going on now with Covid the business that does that is avoiding it and good for them,  nice to see SOME businesses in Prescott being safe.  Disappointing that swimming isn't allowed."
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Pretty area/not worth the rental fee,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful area. Nice path around the lake.some pic is spots under trees. We went to the north side where there is a ramp to the lake, or stairs. Not for someone who is hindered physically. "
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Pleasant day kyaking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Enjoyable small lake, very clean, well maintained. We brought our own kayaks, but apparently there is small boat rental available - check in advance for that.  Hiking and camping on site also."
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Peaceful paved path lake view,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Thewater level of the lake was full.  It was peaceful with  lots of people fishing. We walked half way counter clockwise from the north and had shade at 4pm.  Several non motorized boots on the lake and for rent.
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Hike/paddle,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked around near Lynx Lake for 2+ hours. Very nice trail. The 2nd time we went we walked around the lake then paddled.  I would go back, but avoid weekends as they are busy."
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Enjoyable experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Temperature was about 15 degrees cooler than Phoenix.  The nights were down in the 60s. The campsites are clean and level.  The fire pit worked great.  It is an easy walk down to the lake.  The campsites are set in a beautiful pine forest.
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Nature close to town,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just a few miles out from Prescott, and Prescott Valley. Thearea arounf Lynx lake was wonderful. Easy access and well maintained by volunteers from the National Forest Service.  Great free nature center near by on the road there."
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Good for the Kids,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I took my 8 year old son to Lynx to go trout fishing. We rented an aluminum boat with an electric motor. Well, we were lucky. Someone (the forest service, the state, who knows) was stocking the lake that very day and we caught a bunch. Since we were really just there to catch (not to EAT) we put them back, but regardless it was alot of fun. And I'm here to tell you......if you haven't seen your 8 year old son pilot his very first motor boat, well that's worth the price of admission ($5.00) alone! That was in March of 2004. We've been back twice since then. You can rent the boats (in season) from the store on the south end of the lake. About $25.00 for 4 hours. Well worth it!"
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Just a day trip to the lake,4.0 of 5 bubbles,They have a great little cafe there. Good food. Excellent view of the lake. There is also a paddle boat rental and a caneo rental just below the cafe .
Lynx Lake Recreation Area,4.5,Not a difficult walk around the lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This lake reminds us so much of the lakes in Lassen National Park (CA). No difficulty in walking around it. The ground is pretty level, the trail cleared and the views gorgeous. We were there on a Sunday morning, and were surprised at how few cars were in the parking lot. In Arizona, I live in sandals, and had not planned on taking any hikes in Prescott. But, when we saw parents with strollers and small tots and dogs making the round, I decided to attempt that walk in sandals, and that was not a problem. The smell of summer was in the air, and we enjoyed our walk immensely."
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,"Busy, though beautiful",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started by viewing Bear Lake, which we thought was nice but didn't see why it was such a big deal. We then ended up hiking to Alberta Fall since it was less busy than the trail to all the lakes. From there we looked  at the map the park ranger had given us and decided to loop around to Lake Haiyaha (which is the best) and Nymph and Dream lakes back to the trailhead as it didn't look long. I must say it was long - according to my Fitbit we hiked roughly 7.5 miles by the time we were done. What we thought might take an hour or so ended up being 3.5 hours. it was a bit steep at times, but not bad compared to some of the hikes we had done earlier in the week This trail was worth it! We saw so much: waterfalls, lakes, wide open views, gorges, etc. My husband said it was in the top 3 of his favorite hikes we have ever taken."
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,Hike past Alberta Falls to Jewel Lake!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We started the morning at Sprague Lake to watch the sunrise and fortunate enough to see a moose herd eating in the lake. Then we adventured to Bear Lake and hiked past Alberta Falls to Mills and Jewel Lakes. It’s a 6+ mile uphill hike with some rocky trails but worth the effort. We were also fortunate to see a herd of elk at the tip of a jewel Lake. The round trip hike took us about 3hr and we walk at a relatively brisk pace. The views are spectacular! 
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,Gateway to the best hikes in the park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bear lake trailhead is your gateway to some of the best hikes in the park!  You can take an easy walk around beautiful bear lake itself to get started!  A super easy and accessible walk.  We always parked at the Park & Ride.  Took the shuttle up.  This is your gateway to Nymph, Dream, and Emerald lakes which is NOT to be missed.  You can also hike down to the Glacier Gorge area and directly onto the trail for Alberta Falls too!"
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,A very central and popular trailhead,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the trailhead that you should choose if you are short on time at the Park. A lot of nice  and interesting trails / sites radiate from this trailhead. Parking here gets filled up very early, so use the Park & Ride service take the free bus here."
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,Bear Lake is a must see,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Awesome short hike,  recommend early morning visit either by car or shuttle bus.  We saw some ladies hiking in flip flops - bad idea especially if you take trail to Victoria Falls.  Walking stick was very helpful.  Snow still on trail late May.  It may not melt til late June.  The views of snowy peaks and the lake were awesome😃"
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,Spectacular!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My hike started at the Bear Lake Trailhead.  From there, I hiked the Dream Lake - Lake Haiyaha Trail to Emerald Lake.  The trails were really busy, especially near Bear Lake.  The temps were in the  mid to upper 20’s F.  There was packed snow and ice on the trail.  I rented micro spikes from a local mountain supply store.  Well worth it.   Spectacular hike!!"
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,Easy walk around the lake. Great photo ops! ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Enjoyed this nice walk that provides lots of good pictures in the late afternoon early evening.  The flies biting were next level.  Bring your spray even though it’s a quick walk around the lake. 
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,Talk to the rangers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you get the chance, talk to one of the rangers at this popular spot.  We met a really nice retired school teacher from northwest Indiana.  He told us to do the Bear Lake hike, then take the trail for Alberta Falls.  From the Falls, take the Glacier Gorge trail, and catch the shuttle there.  It saved us a tough uphill hike back to Bear Lake.  Glad we were able to utilize the shuttle in that way."
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,Great hike for anyone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice trail to Emerald Lake.  Uphill quite a bit but some great scenery, some of the best on the east side.  I think Dream Lake is the best in that 3 lake series.  Fairly heavily trafficked."
Bear Lake Trailhead,4.5,The best hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We took a wonderful hike starting at the Bear Lake Trailhead. We took the trail towards Odessa Lake and ended at the Fern Lake Trailhead.
Precipice Trail,5.0,Here’s your Adrenaline Rush,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was extremely excited to do this trail because of the difficulty level. Certainly lived up to it. This is quite the adrenaline rush. Partner and I are both hikers, in fit shape and we were able to do this easily but it was not without some sweat and fear creeping in here and there. We did this hike after a downpour of rain. We waited for the rain to subside and then proceeded along. I don’t recommend doing the trail during it immediately following a downpour. Well, some spots were slippery and rungs were also nonexistent in certain areas so that was  somewhat scary. Amazing experience and would do it again. Saw some folks turning back once they saw the rungs. I would caution not to attempt if you have serious fear of heights, 0 hiking experience or does not have even basic climbing skills. If you are out of shape, you will certainly have great difficulty as well. Lots of lifting your body up using the rungs so certainly be aware of this. Lots of other amazing trails in Arcadia that you can experience. Cheers, be safe and enjoy!"
Precipice Trail,5.0,Acadia's most amazing trail. Period!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We've been to Acadia many times, and whenever we wanted to ascend the Precipice trail, it was always closed due to the nesting of the Peregrine Falcon.  This year, we arrived a little later than usual (end of August) and were delighted to learn that the trail was open (since mid August, actually).  "
Precipice Trail,5.0,Not for novices or the faint of heart!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the best most dangerous most fun trail ,I have been on since Angel's Landing at Zion. Anyone can hike up to the dangerous cliff at Angel's but NOT everyone can do the vast majority of this hike."
Precipice Trail,5.0,Great hike for fun and bragging rights!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I am afraid of heights and almost didn’t do this trail, after reading many reviews, I decided to give it a try."
Precipice Trail,5.0,"This is a climbing trail, not a hiking trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a hiking trail. It is a non-technical climbing trail. That means, while you don’t need ropes and such to climb, you will be climbing almost the entire time.  There is no stretch of flat ground to walk on, you are always climbing over rocks, boulders, and or ladders. In many places you need to pull yourself up over rocks. There are helpful handholds in some places. In some places the handholds are required, i.e, you can’t get up without them. If you have a fear of heights, have knee or balance issues, or can’t do some serious climbing this is not the trail for you. This is also not a trail for young kids. You may want to wear pants or you may scrape your knees or legs as in some cases you need to climb with knees first and you’ll need a good pair of shoes with a good grip as in some places, the granite can be a bit smooth. Also, you need patience, as the trail is narrow, you can’t really pass and when we were there, we saw a few people who really shouldn’t have been on that trail, causing a huge hold up for everyone else. We came down a different trail then switched back to this one which was a huge mistake as we had to wait for the crowd going up. Also watch out for snakes. We saw one and it didn’t feel great to be forced to place your hands (to pull yourself up) in the same area where the snake had disappeared.  But, with all those comments over, if you aren’t afraid of heights, have good balance and good knees and arm strength, this was a very fun trail to climb. I’d definitely do it again."
Precipice Trail,5.0,"Challenging hike, but so fun!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Challenging hike, but so worth it! You need to be in good shape, wear good shoes and I recommend gloves too. Take your time so as to not make a careless mistake that could end in injury. Focus on what you are doing, and not how you could easily fall. The metal bars along the way are a big help. The trail is overall very well done, could use a little help in deciphering which way to get down. We ended up having to walk along park loop road for a while."
Precipice Trail,5.0,Tackling my fear of heights,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was terrified to do this trail before I began. I would say I am oderately afraid of heights, far more than my hiking buddies who seemed unphased.  I talked myself up and worked up the courage and I am glad that I did. The initial portion of the trail is bouldering, then you climb about 0.6 miles up the mountain on a combination of iron ladders and rungs secured into the mountain to reach the summit. At the summit the views are breathtaking! When you are mid climb you feel very safe. I am afraid of heights, but the level of detail and intentionality put into the ladders and iron handlebars made me feel very safe.  At no point did I feel like my life was at risk. Was I super afraid before doing this trail that I almost pooped my pants? yes.  Now that I’ve done it and experienced it, Would I do this trail again?  absolutely!!  "
Precipice Trail,5.0,Don't let the weather scare you off,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Another Acadia ""must do"" if you are in shape. We went up Precipice to Champlain, then over to Gorham Mountain and exited to the South of Thunder Hole. We walked back via Ocean Path Trail and stopped at Thunder Hole. It was a long route but was mostly a descent after Champlain so was fairly easy. We started at 7:45 on a cloudy, foggy morning and had the trail almost to ourselves. Reached the summit fairly quickly, stopped for breakfast and within 30 minutes the fog had burned off and we were rewarded with spectacular views. So don't let the weather scare you off."
Precipice Trail,5.0,Must do in Acadia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Amazing hike/ climb. Beautiful views from the summit. My kids (10 and 12) made it up without a problem. It had rained the day before so there were some slippery spots. Even with that, everyone loved it!! "
Precipice Trail,5.0,"Hard, dangerous and not for younger kids.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was harder and more dangerous than expected.  I took my 9 year old son who is very capable and a somewhat experienced hiker.  I had to give him two or three boosts.  In hindsight, I would've waited until he was probably 12 years old.  I recommend this hike, but it is no joke and you have to be capable."
Notch Trail,4.5,Fun Time,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a group of 10 which included kids aged 7,7,9,10,12, and 15. It feels like most of the trail is getting to the ladder although I’m not exactly sure if we made it to the end once on top. The ladder was fun to climb even though I have a fear of heights. I was able to walk up it more than halfway and it never felt unsafe. You can also scramble up/down a narrow dirt path to the side of the ladder if needed. I saw a couple in their 60’s who did this and said it wasn’t too bad. Once on top there are some drop offs but the ledges are fairly wide. With that said, there were a few parts were I held my 7 year old’s hand. Don’t skip this trail or Saddle Pass if you want some great views and adventure."
Notch Trail,4.5,"Best Badland Experience, Signature NPS Hike MUST DO",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the most fun activity we did in Badlands.  The hike is both beautiful and challenging, and most importantly, the view at the end is simply incredible.   It has everything you came to see at Badlands NP.  There are some challenging spots both the ladder climb and the canyon edge but do not let these deter you.  Please note this is a signature hike in the NPS system for the ladder which is a woodrail ladder that begins gradual as simple steps before ending vertical like a ladder.  Truly it is not that bad, easier going up than down.  You then walk on the canyon ledge that adds some additional excitement to this hike.  "
Notch Trail,4.5,Very nice trail with a good view at the end,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The issue with this very nice trail is that there is this ladder that scares so many people. Since there is a bottleneck at the ladder, you can go up the side (on the left, the second 'gully' closest to the ladder) and avoid having to wait for people coming down. "
Notch Trail,4.5,Fun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was a bit nervous to attempt this trail even though it’s short based on what I’d read about it previously, but it was a blast! Starts out easy enough (pretty flat), and the ladder was more of a mental thing to overcome than anything. After that, you’re walking/climbing along the actual rock formations, which was super fun. Definitely recommend wearing sturdy hiking shoes; you’ll need the extra support. The biggest obstacle in the Badlands is the heat; bring extra water, keep eating, and try to go early or later in the day. The view at the end is lovely! "
Notch Trail,4.5,An Interesting Experience ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed the park and our visit to Badlands. It is truly a unique place. We stayed at Cedar Pass Lodge. The cabin was very nice. It had been recently renovated. The only problem we encountered is that there really wasn’t any place to eat. There was a cafe but the choices were very limited. We were forced to go to the town of Interior for dinner. We went to a local bar called the Wagon Wheel Bar and Grill. It was very rustic, but the service was very friendly and the limited menu had some edible food. All in all a nice experience "
Notch Trail,4.5,Nice and fun (ladder climbing) trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Awesome short (2 miles) trail, but you must climb a ladder about 40 yards up (and don't forget down) to experience the whole trail. Kids with good balance and not afraid of heights will love it."
Notch Trail,4.5,"Our favorite trail, but was hard for me, but I'm not in great shape!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was kind of a hard trail for me, a 56 year old big girl not in the best shape, but BOY WAS IT WORTH IT!  We went slowly and took our time, rested on some rocks here and there and NO REGRETS!  Loved the trail.  Younger folks (or those in better shape than me) would say this is not a terribly strenuous hike, but it was the toughest one I personally did while I was in the Black Hills.  Let me encourage you to try it!  If you can climb a ladder, you can do it!!   Loads of young folks were passing us, but we just slogged along and managed it well.  I loved this as I felt like I accomplished something (don't laugh at me young, fit people)....Views at the end are worth it and the trail itself is the coolest trail I've ever taken. "
Notch Trail,4.5,Overcrowded ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Was surprisingly busy for a weekday in late October. Nice that you can hike anywhere including off trail. The biggest hang up is the log ladder about half way up the trail. It is a unique feature but people were so busy trying to get multiple photos of themselves on the ladder that it really slowed up the hike. There is a way up and down next to the ladder but it is a little steep. 
Notch Trail,4.5,Best Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is the best hike in BNP.  There is easy parking with a restroom before you head in.  There are other trails that start from same parking lot so be sure you see the sign for Notch before you start out.  The ladder is easy up and a bit complicated coming down for young children. We say kids of all ages going up and down.  The end is much closer than you think and worth making it to.  The trick is you cannot tell how far the end is so many people turn around about 100 yards short.     
Notch Trail,4.5,Read this review to find a secret path,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Several websites said that this is the best hike in Badlands National Park, so we decide to do it. It is rated as moderate to strenuous. There is ladder that you are supposed to climb to get to the top of cliff but we couldn't really use it to get up as there was a line of people waiting to get down. Everyone should know that this ladder or climb to the top of the cliff is entirely unnecessary. You can easily walk along the dry river bed and get to the outlook. Conversely, the National Park Service could put in a set of stairs to the tops to avoid the silliness."
Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,We won't go back,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stayed at the campground here on July 7th. I would not recommend this campground for anyone, especially if you have a big rig. The road in is very narrow and there are NO BERMS. You literally have white knuckles the entire time, hoping no cars are coming the other way. We wanted to use the dump station and fill up with water since all they have is electric.  The dump station is backward.  You have to go all the way through the park and come back from the opposite direction to use it. We finally got to our back in site, but could not back in. They had a large 5th wheel with truck in a site directly across from ours and there was no way to make the turn to back in. So we pulled in and had to stretch the electric cord under the motorhome. We got plugged in and set up. They advertise 30 amp, but there is no way we had 30 amp. My milk curdled and my potato salad spoiled in my fridge. We weren't even running the air. . We stayed one night , then left in a 40 ft. mitorhome."

Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,Possibly the Most Fantastic Place in WV!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a view!!!!  And the way it is made is amazing.  Lots of room to look out over the hills and sky and river.  If you go out all the way the rock is slanted, adds to the experience.  "
Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,Amazing views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Absolutely amazing views and hiking trails.  There were several trails to choose from but each one was very crowded.  We did go on a Saturday in October to enjoy the fabulous fall colors and apparently everyone else had the same idea.  You could see for miles at the top of the trails.  There was plenty of places to stop and picnic.  Parking was difficult.  There were cars parked all over the roadway because the lots were full.  Every single person we came across was pleasant and mindful of how busy it was and that we were all out trying to enjoy the day.  Will return!
Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,Beautiful views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We meet our grown children at this park and camped at one of the rugged campsites for 2 nights.  The park is just beautiful!  There are lots of trails to hike and the views are amazing! Parking is a challenge at some of the trail heads, we had to walk a little way down a road to actually start a hike. Don't miss the overlook, it is worth the crowd.  The campsites are very nice, big enough for 2 large tents & the bathrooms are clean. We arrived late on a Friday and were told no worries, just stop at the camp office the next day.  We will certainly be back."
Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,Breathtaking views of WV,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hadn’t been to Coopers Rock since I was a small child. Back then, there was a lack of appreciation for the natural beauty that this destination has to offer.   As I stepped out onto the natural rock shelf and saw the breathtaking panoramic view it took my breath away!  There are also hiking trails under the rock shelf with ginormous rock formations to meander through.  I loved this park!!"
Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,Beautiful overlook. Interesting rock caves! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Haven been to many overlooks in PA, NJ, NY, Virginia, etc. we were pleasantly surprised by the views at Coopers Rock State Forest. West Virginia is just lovely. However when we walked around we found some caves and wondered if bear or other animals actually live in them. Does anyone know?? Perhaps they are in too public of an area for animals to dwell. I have included some photos. The caves are near Underlook Trail"
Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,Free State Park with Views and Rocks,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Offers stunning views and some hiking opportunities.
Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,Great place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rock City is great, and they actually have two of them, with the unmarked one near the overlook better than the marked one.  The trails are in very good shape and are generally well marked.  The strange exception to the well marked trails is that they're not marked near the overlook/trading post.  Also, the handout map is hard to read and not correct, but the permanent maps at kiosks are spot on.  Take a photo of one of those maps and use that."
Coopers Rock State Forest,4.5,Almost Heaven ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Is this what John Denver sang about ""Almost Heaven, West Virginia"". Cooper's Rock State Forest was established in 1936 and it encompasses almost 13,000 acres. The Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) developed this area for the enjoyment of visitors. There are about 22 hiking trails and two campgrounds. Interesting thing is that a blast furnace was built here around 1834 that employed about 200 workers and produced about four tons of pig iron a day. They had about 100 dwellings with a store, church, and school. Hard work for sure. The have a nice trading post with many unique items. Great people to talk with."
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,All buttoned up,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed a hike in the meadows area after the seasonal closure of the visitor center.  As expected, nothing was open.  But we enjoyed the views & the beginnings of fall color."
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,Unreal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were lucky enough to practically have the place all to ourselves. When we arrived a small group of people were just leaving and for the couple of hours that we stayed walking around the meadow, there was nobody else in sight. Very peaceful and serene. The views are postcard amazing. It started raining a little bit but just lasted for around 10 minutes. You can imagine our senses of sight, hearing and smell were to the max. Unforgettable experience."
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,Beautiful views of Tuolomne Meadows,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had a great visit going up to the Meadows and hiking LAmbert Dome.  What a beautiful set of views.  Caught crazy flash flood rain and hail on the night of Sept 12th on our way back at about 5 pm!  beautiful and a bit scary too.
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,P A C I F I C /  C R E S T  /  T R A I L,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Folks, Another Redeeming Feature of this stop is the Crossover of the Pacific Crest Trail! For casual visitors this is an accessible hike to say you been on this 2,653 mile gem. Even though 70 miles of the PCT are within Yosemite, few day trippers and East Coasters have the ability to hike it. Here is your chance!! Stop the car and hike a small section up to Soda Springs or beyond. Its flat, scenic and alpine quality are magical. BONUS TIP:  The PCT and the famous John Muir Trail overlap right here in the Meadow! 2 famous trails for price of one."
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,Easy and scenic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful area and easy place for a nice walk. Lots of people unfortunately but we had a nice lunch spot to ourselves by a stream. We only walked to soda springs (was nice and easy after clouds rest) but found it worth it!
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,i love it!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,it's a great place to get away from crowds and just have fun! the campsites are awesome nad it has a really fun river to swim in that everyone can enjoy!
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,Dont just visit the Valley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had gone to the valley a couple of years previously and thoroughly enjoyed it. But this time, we had to go through the Tioga Pass en route from East to West on our tour. The pass itself was stunning but when we reached the Meadows, we asked for advice at the ranger station about where to go to eat our lunch. He suggested Pothole Dome which is reached by a short walk from the road and which not only offers 360 degree views around the immediate area but right over the park as far as Half Dome. Absolutely stunning."
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,Pothole Dome Tuolumne Meadows,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is an entrance fee as you enter Yosemite National Park, but no additional fee for any hikes."
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,Tuolumne Meadows - close to heaven,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Many people, even in California, do not know about this area of Yosemite National Park.  It is High Country, on the Eastern side of the park.  The Altitude is about 8600 ft., nearer to 9000 ft. at the Tioga Pass entrance (reached from the 395).  The Tuolumne river meanders through the broad meadow.  Granite domes are sprinkled around.  You can scramble up one, like Pothole dome, and get spectacular views, and no crowds.  The air has a wonderful clarity. You can stay here only in summer, but you can visit it until snow closes the road (120/Tioga Rd.) and I really like it in fall.  There are many wonderful hikes of varying difficulty.  In fact, if you aren't used to altitude, it's best to do easier hikes the first day or two.  Moseying down the Lyell fork is gorgeous and easy.  Wandering the meadow and visiting Soda Springs are easy and spectacular activities. (The springs sort of look like water on Mars, since the soil is so red.) We also exited the park and went down to Mono Lake and to the ghost town of Bodie.  Both are very well worth it.  Mono Lake looks like it's on another planet, at sunset it is a real spectacle. This area is volcanic and the geology is fascinating. In summer, there is often a program of live music at the Mobil station in Lee Vining -- and the Mobil's Whoa Nelly Deli also offers very good food.  So check bulletin boards for the evening the music will be there. And if you like beer, try the 395 IPA--especially the juniper/sage brew."
Tuolumne Meadows,4.5,River and Meadow,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We tried coming here to avoid the smoke from the Creek Fire, but unfortunately it found us here anyway.  We tried making the best of it, and the kids enjoyed getting to skip stones and play in the river just off the road.  There are lots of hiking trails and opportunities to see wildlife in this area, and with the high elevation off of Tioga Rd, it's generally cooler in the area as well."
Second Beach Trail,4.5,"Crazy Name for a Beach, but Wonderful Beach",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Traveling along Highway 101 from Port Angeles to the Hoh Rainforest you'll come across several beaches given only numbers as names. You don't want to miss a one -or more importantly Second Beach. A beautiful beach for a walk, picnic, or watching the sunset."
Second Beach Trail,4.5,Beautiful and serene,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful beach at low tide (10:30 am). There were many rock formations, although the low tide was only -2.75"". The rocks had mussels and clams and sea urchins on them. We also saw an otter! The path to the beach is about a mile. As you enter the beach, if you go to the left, you may be able to walk out to the rock further out. We saw this later, so did not go in case the tide came in. "
Second Beach Trail,4.5,Lovely beach near La Push,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"First of all, after reading some of the reviews, I should mention that this is a review of Second Beach and not Beach 2."
Second Beach Trail,4.5,Beautiful summer visit but steep hike and climb At end,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful pacific beach on warm Saturday in July. Must have been 50 tents in beach filled with young people and families. Water warm enough to wade. Long beach to walk and photograph mid tide. Husband hurt knee had great difficulty climbing over large mounds of driftwood to get to sand.
Second Beach Trail,4.5,Fabulous stroll with a great reward,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A great find! Limited parking at the trailhead but understandably has overflow parking nearby. There is basic portable toilets at the trailhead.
Second Beach Trail,4.5,"Little Crowded, But Nice",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Here's the deal with camping on La Push's Second Beach (also known simply as Second Beach, Forks in Clallam County): You park at the trailhead, which is always crowded on weekends, yet always has people leaving as well as coming. There is overflow parking, rarely needed. You don't need to get there early, just an hour before dark."
Second Beach Trail,4.5,Gorgeous Beach! Worth the hike down.....,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a beautiful place to simply hike the endless sandy beaches and relax. You will need to be mindful of the steep path to the beach, but it's worth it. A must see!"
Second Beach Trail,4.5,One of Earth's best places,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is truly one of Earth's best places.  This place has deep soulful meaning to my wife and I.  It's in the top 5 best bang for your hiking effort buck locations anywhere.  I actually love the fact that it takes about 20 minutes from the parking lot to the beach. Otherwise, I think 1000's of people would be there every day even though its a pretty remote location.  I could sit and stare at the sea stacks for days.  A sunset at this beach can change your life, if you are lucky enough to have the weather cooperate to provide you a sunset, and the sunrises are as good if not better.  Don't fret the full parking lot, remote location, short hike, and frequently difficult weather, just go to this place.  If you were a 20 minute walk from the Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China, Pyramids, or Mt Rushmore would you stay in the car?  You shouldn't here either and this is better than all of those."
Second Beach Trail,4.5,A must do while in ONP!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We went here last week while in ONP. We arrived just over an hour before low tide which was perfect. The hike through the forest is another beautiful ONP hike. The fun part is when you pass through the trees and see the pile of driftwood to climb over and the beautiful beach and seastacks. Amazing view! Our day started cloudy with rain in the forecast but apparently that is true of most days there. As we reached the beach the sun came out and we had awesome weather. We visited the tidepools and saw a variety of anemone.  We live near the Atlantic but this was a beautiful beach not to be missed!
Second Beach Trail,4.5,Don't get the love for this place!,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"There were a lot of reviews that absolutely raved about this Beach, even some of the locals recommended it as their favorite.  One place (AAA tourbook? Don't remember) said it was .8 mile hike ""mostly level with some stairs at the end"".  Wow.  In whose universe?  Maybe athletic 20-somethings!  Yes, we're in our early 60's but we go to the gym 3x/wk, walk the dog 2 miles every day and yes we'd already hiked the Hall of Mosses Trail in the Hoh Rainforest and down to Ruby Beach before we hit this.  BUT STILL the trail was up hill, down dale over rocks and roots with a steep descent on giant steps and a logjam obstacle course at the end!  Yes it's a beautiful beach which is the only reason I don't give it a ""terrible"" review.  WORSE YET was the single unspeakably NASTY port-a-potty with no paper and no sanitizer in the parking lot at the head of the trail.  Not to mention that the parking lot was mobbed and the overflow parking was up yet another hill some distance away  Then nearly a mile hike back, all uphill.  Ruby Beach was so much better - shorter hike & really nice facilities, just less parking."
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Perfect Summer Family Bike Ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented bikes in town and rode out to the Rio Grande Trail.  It was an easy and scenic trail, perfect for our family.  We stopped several times along the way for a snack or just to admire the scenery.  They say bears are sometimes cited here this time of year.  We did spot some wildlife, but we did not run into any bears.   We were only gone a couple of hours.  We took our time and stopped off at the John Denver Sanctuary on the way back to town.  Great, family friendly, accessible bike or walking trail. "
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,A wonderful rail-trail in a beautiful location,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented eBikes from Four Mountain Sports in Aspen, and bicycled the Rio Grande trail from Aspen almost to Basalt, stopping at Woody Creek Tavern on the way back.  The best part of the trail for us was between Aspen and Woody Creek, with the trail hugging the cliff side and the river far below, but wide enough to be safe and not stressful.  The surprise waterfall alongside the trail was a nice bonus.  People on the trail were friendly and happy and fun to talk with.  We also really liked the mid-mount Trek eBikes that simply assist your pedaling rather than act like a moped."
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Just one of the Greatest Rides Ever !!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I Might of already wrote a Review on this Bike trail Before. But it is Simply one of our Favorites. Every year we Drive out from Fort Collins to go to My Sister's House in New Castle. Just so that we can Ride our Bikes on the Rio Grande Bike Trail. We Always wanted to Ride this Trail in October and this year we Finally Did. We came out the first week of October and the Colors were Fantastic. The Aspen Colors were amazing and I had to Stop Myself from taking so many Pictures so we could complete our Ride. We ride from Glenwood Springs to Aspen and Back. It's just over 80 Miles but such a FANTASTIC RIDE. We would Highly Recommend this Ride to Anyone. You just won't be Disappointed.
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Enjoyed the ride on Rio Grande Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I cycled this trail from Carbondale to Aspen & back, almost 62 miles round trip, from 8:30am-3:45pm, Sat, Nov 4, 2023.  We walked Aspen for a bit and grabbed something to eat at Clark's Market, eating on picnic tables in the middle of that shopping center.  It's a really nice paved trail that mostly runs along the Roaring Fork River, but through open fields, parallelling highway 82, through the small towns of Woody Creek and Basalt.  It's a gradual uphill to Aspen and even though it's downhill back to Carbondale, it's still work both ways.  The last 5 miles into & out of Aspen are gravel and that area is at the bottom of a hill/mountain with signs to watch out for rock slides.  Since it had snowed the week before, some spots that don't see sun were still covered with frozen snow which made it hard to ride through as you could easily get caught in a rut and eat it.  There's a small waterfall along the trail outside Aspen, nothing special, but different.  We enjoyed the ride with views of the surrounding mountains & fields and would like to ride this trail in the fall, when the leaves are changing.  And next time we'll stop at Woody Creek Tavern (as recommended by reviews).  We only saw two portapotties along the trail but there's a nice facility in Aspen, can't miss it."
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Enjoyable bike ride- open views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great paved trail. My wife and I road from Glenwood Springs down to Carbondale and back which was a perfect late morning ride. Small uphill grade all the way to Carbondale but then you get to coast back. Easy for relatively fit non-cyclists. Well-maintained and almost empty when we went on a Monday. Essentially no shade though- so make sure you have sunscreen.
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Awesome bike ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rented comfort  NON  ebikes from aspen bikes (great store downtown aspen where we also rented paddle boards and cruised the sanctuary located  a few miles up the road) and road to the town of basalt. Beautiful easy 18 mile flat/ downhill ride, stopped at woodys for a drink and had lunch at the tipsy trout on the river in basalt. Rode our bikes to the bus station maybe a mile away and loaded our bikes on the bus for a free ride back to aspen. This is an absolute must, the prettiest part is as you are riding out of aspen but it was just a gorgeous 70 degree sunny day. My 15 yo son loved it."
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Great Trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great bike trail. Note, I rode it from Glenwood Springs to Carbondale and have not been on the Aspen end of it. From Glenwood Springs to Carbondale it is a low grade ascent. Trail is wide and family friendly. I missed a sign in Carbondale (I'm sure it was there and it was my own fault). I accidentally ended up by the Crystal River Trail south out of Carbondale and really enjoyed that. There are a few more ups and downs on the Crystal River Trail, but it is quieter with less nearby car traffic."
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Incredible views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We rented bikes to ride along the Rio Grande Trail in Aspen. The trailhead is easy to find. We enjoyed this trail so much that we went back a second time during our stay in Aspen. Much of the trail is along the river.
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Walking vs. Biking the Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I just walked the Rio Grande Trail all the way from the John Denver Sanctuary (that was our starting point and a GORGEOUS and inspirational way to start the walk) to Woody Creek Tavern, about 8 miles away. It was a long walk but stunning. Most others we saw were biking the trail. I think very few people walk it. "
Rio Grande Trail,5.0,Not for the faint of heart,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Reading these reviews I thought a bike ride through Rio Grande Trail to Woody Creek, then continuing on to Basalt would be a breeze, it was anything but.  Most of the views during the ride were fantastic although there are some points in the ride where there is not much to see and what there is to see seem to repeat,,,farm houses, small valleys, etc..."
Max Patch,5.0,Nice view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Max Patch is about a 40 minute drive from Hot Springs, half of that traveled on a gravel road. We did the loop hike and it was an easy hike with an awesome view at the top. Would love to see the sunrise or sunset. You can camp overnight at the top."
Max Patch,5.0,Trashed Out,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The first time I went to Max Patch was around 1977. There was no parking lot. I think the AT had yet to be moved to go over the top of the bald. The last visit prior to today was about 2014. The parking lot was still usually empty. Still clean. Never saw tents there. Now it is trashed out with feces, used toilet paper, over crowded, no parking, unsafe. Do not go. "
Max Patch,5.0,Amazing View,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful ride up to the parking lot. Last couple of miles gravel road. Last half mile was muddy-clayey due to overnight rain. Drive carefully. It’s a loops hike up about 1.5 miles. If you want to do a section of the Appalachian Trail, then take the left route up (sign says “easiest hike”) about 3/4 mile up it will be a T-section with wooden post.... take left to hike into AT. This section should be in and out hike.... about 3+ miles in you will come across AT Shelter. When you return back to the wooden post, keep going up to the summit..... open expanse of 360 degrees view of the mountains. Breath taking in every direction. Follow signs to go back down the summit towards the parking lot, which will be about 1.5 miles down. Love it all! "
Max Patch,5.0,Little getaway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a view!! I have been wanting to visit for a few years now and for my birthday my husband took me.  The flowers were so pretty.  We went through the week, so it was not packed. It was kinda hot, we went mid August. The bald is absolutely breathtaking.  Remember to bring bug spray and some water."
Max Patch,5.0,Nice for a day hike.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Would not say it is our favorite hike, but it is a very ice day hike.  A ways from Hot Springs but worth the trip.  The mountain views from the more barren patch are spectacular.  But a very nice hike into the wilderness from there, including an over-night rest stop at one point."
Max Patch,5.0,Please carry out your trash!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,It's a beautiful spot with some of the best 360 views in NC. 
Max Patch,5.0,No order,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Due to the fact we as well as other families, live up past Max Patch something needs to be done about parking. Ppl park just anywhere. Mostly just stop in the Rd and get out. I have see cars with dents down the side of them because ppl have no respect for others that have to try and get through this madness. A big 4x4 will leave tire marks down the side of your vehicles. It's not monitored by anyone. It says no camping but is loaded every night with tents, campfires and ppl just taking a poop anywhere and leaving it. The worst of it all is if anyone up on this mountain needed an emergency vehicle, most days there's no way one is getting through the madhouse on the Rd. He only parking lot holds about 10 to 12 cars. The other 20 to 30 vehicles just stop on in Rd because there is NO SIDE OF THE RD. The locals who live here hate what is happening here."
Max Patch,5.0,Easy hike if you take the correct trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As you have undoubtedly read, this hike to the top of Max Patch is well worth your time. The view is unequalled in Western NC. "
Max Patch,5.0,"Too many people, but the views are nice",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I and our 2 dogs hiked this area as a day hike. The views are incredible, but we like peace and quiet and it was far from it. The entire area was crowded with tents and people. Cars were parked up and down the road because the parking area was full. It was nice to have seen it, but we will not go back there. We found other nicer  hiking in the area."
Max Patch,5.0,Absolutely gorgeous,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Awesome views driving up the mountain. My little 4 cylinder Civic had no issues getting up the gravel and dirt roads. Once we fought the altitude and got to the top, the views were stunning. "
Pinellas Trail,4.5,Absolutely wonderful trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rode many different ways on this trail. The length of Honeymoon Island / Dunedin Causeway and into the park ($2 per person if you enter park, which we did. Nice empty trail there.)  And from Causeway to Crystal Beach pier. And from Causeway to downtown Dunedin. It goes all the way to Tarpon from the Causeway too. It has a lot of variety and you see lots of marinas up that way. It's mostly flat so you can go longer than other long trails since it's less work. If you go from Causeway toward Tarpon, you can go over the highway on the bridge. That is a bit steep and more work but better than trying to cross 4 or so lanes of traffic staying below if it's a busy time of day. But at least they give you a choice. Just love the way this area is bike friendly. "
Pinellas Trail,4.5,About 45 miles in total end to end,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"At the time of writing - December 2022 - the trail actually runs from downtown St Petersburg on 1st Avenue and 1st Street to just beyond East Lake Road beyond Tarpon Springs. At this point the marked trail ends, but cycle lanes are available albeit on the edge of multi lane roads.  In total about 45 marked miles from St Pete to East Lake Road.  Do not believe any of the other numbers put out there on the web."
Pinellas Trail,4.5,A great experience,4.0 of 5 bubbles,There’s so much to see and do along this trail. We travelled by E-bike so we were able to cover about 25 of the 38 miles. The only negative- we ran in to 2 jerks in our week stay in Dunedin- both on the trail. Each jerk was on their high dollar racing bikes and made rude passing comments. That group thinks they own the trail and they take themselves way too seriously. The trail is for everyone’s pleasure. 
Pinellas Trail,4.5,E-bikes from Dunedin to Tarpon Springs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rode from Dunedin to Tapon Spings on rented e bikes (from the Bicycle Boutique). What a great time! We rented for 3 hours and that allowed us time to visit Hellas bakery for Baklava, take out spanakopita from Mamas, and shop for some sponges. We could have spent another hour there but needed to get back. We averaged 16 mph but the e-bikes can really fly! We felt like we were cheating as we passed other bikers, but it was a fun outing."
Pinellas Trail,4.5,Dunedin section,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I walked just a short portion of the trail while visiting Dunedin over Labor Day weekend and were very impressed with the amount of people that are using it. People walk, bike, run, and traffic does give way for people when they come to intersections. Very impressive trail"
Pinellas Trail,4.5,GREAT COMMUNITY OFFERING ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This path is hard to beat. A great addition to any community. All towns should work to have an amenity like this. It is a draw for people of all types and thus supports many types of other business.  Great job!!
Pinellas Trail,4.5,Whew!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Whew! Have really enjoyed using this trail both for recreation and for getting places!  Beautiful to be out and getting some fresh air!  Along the path I take are homes, businesses, a school, and parks, such as Wall Springs Park (restrooms). The trail is provides for two-way bike traffic and a pathway for walkers.  As for access, I am a resident, not a tourist, and I'm able to come from my home. Others also converge onto the trail from their communities. Some people park at neighboring parking lots. Some park along the road. There are places along the way to stop for refreshments, and that would include restrooms. I would encourage people with bicycles to take the trail; not sure how it is for those going by foot."
Pinellas Trail,4.5,Fantastic bike trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Among the best bike/walk trails I've ever seen.  Excellently maintained and popular!  AND the motorists I experienced at cross-streets were AWARE and careful for riders.  I especially noted the 'emergency location markers' which can be used to quickly tell 911 where you are. A EXCELLENT feature. I only wish I'd been on MY bike versus the loaner I had.  I just may have to go back for a bike weekend with mine.
Pinellas Trail,4.5,What a wonderful amenity!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is so wonderful to have this trail.  It runs right through downtown Dunedin and you can go for miles north and south.  You can walk and cycle.  There are bike rental companies on the trail -- we like Kafe Racer, which I will review separately.  The trail has both sun and shade, but because we were there in January, it was very pleasant.  Economic development has grown around the trail, so there are nice pubs and restaurants where you can watch the activity on the trail.  It is very well maintained.  We use it every day of our vacation in Dunedin."
Pinellas Trail,4.5,"Wednesday, January 8th trail bike ride.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I started our bike ride from Clearwater Beach.  We rented E-Bikes in Clearwater Beach.  We rode North from Clearwater Beach to Tarpon Springs.  We very much enjoyed our ride and felt very safe on the trail.  The trail was well marked.  There was a lot of stop and go riding, with a lot of intersections and stop signs to deal with on the trail.  It seemed like most of the intersections with the roads were 4 way stops.  It was a fun ride for us, and for us visitors, the scenery was especially fun.  Both Tarpon Springs, and Dunedin, were fun stops.  We would absolutely visit the Pinellas Trail again, probably try going south from Clearwater Beach next time."
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,$5 parking for filthy restrooms,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We came here more for the hike than the lake, and decided as locals that there are far less crowded places to hike where the parking is free and the restrooms are clean.  The signs indicate that there is no street parking and that the $5 parking lot is on private land. There was a row of filthy portable toilets full to the top and infested with flies. Many had bags of trash inside them because there are no trash receptacles provided. The parking lot was full on a Monday, with cars circling and waiting for spots. So what is the ""private owner"" doing with the parking revenue? Perhaps a few calls to the county (Clear Creek) health department might urge them to put some of that income towards servicing the bathrooms and providing trash receptacles......just a thought."
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,A must do trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Parking was 5$. Cash only. There were plenty of spots available. We did the hike on a Tuesday afternoon. There were many people there and made the trail crowded. It is a steep, rocky walk up. The view at the top made it well worth it. There is a lot of room around the lake and glacier area, so it didn’t feel as crowded as the trail was. There is a short hike from the lake right up to the glacier. Excellent picture opportunity. Our kids enjoyed climbing around the rocks, touching the glacier, and stepping into the cool lake. "
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,A Great Short Hike to an Alpine Glacier,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a terrific short trip from Denver into the mountains to hike up to see an Alpine Glacier and glacial lake.  It's about a 1 hr. drive from Denver to reach the trailhead, with self-parking available for $5 (honor system). Then, with a moderately strenuous hike (1.5 mile round-trip)  further up the mountain, one arrives to enjoy the beauty of the glacier, lake and surrounding mountain terrain.  You can actually walk around the small lake and climb onto the glacier. Plus... the drive up into the mountains is itself stunning."
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,Beautiful Mountain Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful drive up and back, and trailhead had ample parking plus toilets.   Hike is not easy, as it is a decent climb and since the ""trail"" is up the glacial moraine it is quite rocky. Wear good hiking shoes.   Trail is not well marked, but as long as you stay on the moraine you make it to the lake with no problem.   Not for strollers.   Lake was beautiful, and the hike crosses a nice bridge to continue up and around the lake to the glacier.  The actual glacier cannot be seen from the lake, you have to hike up the rather loose moraine to the northwest and climb over the ridge to see the glacier. We were there in mid October and the glacier was quite small.  But well worth the hike!"
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,Beautiful spot,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Such a beautiful place, beautiful lake, surrounded by rocks and vegetation which was changing their colors in the end of September."
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,Steep but gorgeous views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a short walk but don’t be fooled it is steep, rocky, and at high altitiude so it’s not easy.   The parking fee is now $20 - we were staying locally so not a problem for us.  The views around the lake area are really lovely but you might be sharing it with a number of other people.   I confess I only got to the bottom of the snow patch but still felt it was worth the climb."
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,Great beautiful hike for a family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were so happy we found this place.  The hike was not overly difficult, and the payoff at the top was more than worth the hike.  The lake was gorgeous and the kids getting to play in the snow was priceless.  Our kids are 6, 8, and 11.  They had a blast.  We saw other kids as young as 4 make the hike, though that may be a stretch for a little one."
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,Breathtaking!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"this trail was amazing! the end view of the glacier was spectacular & breathtaking. The trail was filled with families which was comforting. (especially the dogs) 10/10 would recommend, keep in mind the trail is very rocky at the beginning."
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,Prettiest spot ever,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was worth the rocky, not always well marked trail. It was so beautiful.  I was worried it would be crowded with all the people walking the trail with us, but there was plenty of room to spread out.  Be sure you have $5 in cash to pay parking and a pen to fill out your parking info."
St. Mary's Glacier,4.5,Absolutely stunning trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After reading many reviews online of hikes near the Denver area, I chose this one due to the overwhelming positive reviews and photos. Photos do not do it justice, it is absolutely gorgeous in person. "
Windows,4.5,Make Sure to Include Walking the Primitive Trail for Great Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Arrived in the early morning 30 minutes after sunrise to avoid the crowds that build here throughout the day given the easy accessibility with a short easy walk from the parking lot. Sun was still low in the sky making for cool views of North Window. What really made the experience was walking the primitive trail from just beyond South Window which loops around the back side of the arches providing outstanding views of both North And South Window especially in the early morning light and explaining why The Spectacles are a good nickname.  The primitive trail was a bit difficult to find but once on it, I could easily follow the rock cairns. I was the only one walking the trail on an early Monday morning in late August. Made the whole experience pretty special."
Windows,4.5,Excellent hike with three arches close to each other,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Windows section was one of our highlights.  The lower and upper windows along with the Turret Arch are all right next to each other.  The hikes are easy and you can visit all 3 arches and take plenty of pictures in an hour.  A must do while visiting Arches.
Windows,4.5,Easy hike with big payout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'd recommend coming here early as the trail does get busy (and hot). It's a loop and we did it clockwise, going first to North Window. There is a bit of elevation gain and stairs, but not too difficult at all. North Window was the busiest, but people were respectful of letting you get a photo in front of it without standing in the way. I'd recommend walking up and looking through the window at an amazing view of the park."
Windows,4.5,Many great views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Windows are unique and different from the arches throughout the park. There are 3-4 trails you can take, with the trailhead at the parking lot. I definitely recommend the Primitive Trail for great views and vistas of the park. Hikes are easy to moderate. You can walk right up to the windows with a bit of rock scrambling and get some great pictures inside the windows (North Window and South Window). You will see both sides of the windows if you hike the Primitive Trail. The Double Arch is across the road so you can park once and enjoy both attractions. Make sure to wear a hat because there is no shade."
Windows,4.5,Can't miss taking the Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fabulous views from the ""Windows"" trail. Easily see a half dozen arches of various sizes. But the South Window and the North Window are the main attractions on this side of the loop trail. Be aware that there are some steps and good shoes with a decent tread are really nice to have. Some parts of the trail and steps can have a very thin ""dusting"" of loose sand that can be very slippery, so pay attention to the trail and avoid walking with your eye on your camera or phone.  It is incredibly hard  not to walk and focus on the arches and the vistas, so take your time, stop and scope out yet another amazing view... click, click"
Windows,4.5,"easy hike, easy view",5.0 of 5 bubbles,A nice and short easy hike - you barely need to leave the parking lot!
Windows,4.5,Two Arches within One Fin - Signature Sight,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Windows are one of the premier arches that you need to see on your visit.  They are a pair of arches in the same fin but they are some of the larger arches in the park.  The way they sit on top of a ridge in the park allows them to be seen across the park.  Additionally, the two aches side by side create the appearance that the fin is the rim for a set of glasses.  When you step away from the arches you can see what they call the Spectacles.  There is a trail that goes around the Windows and I suggest you hike this for the best view of the Spectacles.  Also take the time to walk into the arches and under them as the size of the opening is impressive here.  This is one of the arches that is a signature sight for the park and Must See."
Windows,4.5,Looking Like A Mascara,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This double treat arches are great art work of mother nature. You can see from one window arch  the Turret Arch nearby. You can take photo looking though one window within the arch. Amazing  view.
Windows,4.5,Cool Area of Arches,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Windows - South, and North are on the opposite side of Double Arch so simply park and hike to both areas without giving up a parking spot. There is a slight hike to the first Window and a slightly longer hike to the second Window. The second window has some intense wind gusts but amazing views. Be sure to have water and wear proper hiking shoes since the stones can become slippery."
Windows,4.5,North and South Windows,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The parking lot at “the windows section” has both the North Window, the South Window, the Turret Arch as well as the Double Arch on the opposite side of the parking lot. "
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Best day ever!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My fiance, parents, and I had the most amazing time ever on our outing with Chilly Dogs! Everyone there was super polite, knowledgeable, and professional; you can tell that this is their passion. I was a little nervous and didn't know what to expect, but after meeting the sweet, friendly dogs and listening to the orientation, I felt confident and very excited! Also, the rental gear is well-priced and very high quality; as a visitor to the North Country I was so glad Chilly Dogs provided this option. My nose and toes got chilly but overall I was nice and warm the whole time. Being out in the snowy wilderness with no sounds but the dogs panting and the sled runners on the snow was magical... I didn't want to come in! This was a bucket list day, but I would do it again in a minute!"
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Sled dog trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely fantastic trip.  Guides are extremely knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic about all things sledding.  It is apparent that both they, and their dogs, love what they do.  I highly recommend their devices to anyone interested in a great north woods experience."
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Great experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our second great experience with Chilly Dogs. This time we also stayed at the rental accommodations in Ely that Chilly Dogs owns...it is a comfy, newly renovated four-bedroom, two bath, two living rooms place in Ely that is perfect for a group. Altogether a top-notch experience. "
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Amazing family experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I booked the 3-hour sled dog experience for my husband, myself, and our two daughters (ages 7 and 9).  Our daughters loved meeting and learning about the sled dogs.  My husband and I enjoyed driving the sleds through the winter landscape.  It was very cold but manageable with the right gear (you can rent gear from them if you don’t own it).  Our daughters want to come back when they are old enough to drive the sleds!  Highly recommend."
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Fantastic ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Friends and I recently took the 3 hour trip with Jake and the Chilly Dogs crew. We had a fantastic time!  My only wish is that we had signed up for a longer trip.  In the 3 hours you end up spending about 30 minutes riding in the sled and 30 minutes standing on the runners.  I loved the time on the trail (it's beautiful) and also interacting with the dogs in the dog yard.  I also like Chilly Dogs' mission of making sure retired race dogs have somewhere to go in retirement and continue doing what they love (running / pulling). The people here are great as well! 
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Wonderful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wonderful time beautiful comfortable accomodations. We did the North Woods 2 hour trip; great instructions on how to Mush also liked info given about the dog's breed and their life style. Guides and family very informative and you can tell they love their dogs!!
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Good dogs!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the 2 hour (backcountry loop) tour in early January. Chilly Dogs is a class act. They know their dogs individually and take pride in introducing you to these amazing athletes. Get ready for kisses: these dogs are affectionate and want to greet you. I loved the kennel tour and was ready to quit my job to volunteer at Chilly Dogs. After the kennel tour, you receive a rapid-fire introduction to mushing, suit up (thank you for the rented fur gloves - they made me so comfortable) and you're off for one of the most amazing rides of your life. I was nervous to drive a sled with six energetic and strong dogs for the first time, but the dogs know what they're doing. We humans did what we'd learned from Jake, adjusted to minor challenges that arose along the trail, and had a total blast. Our Australian friend now wants to move to Minnesota after this marvelous experience."
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Snowy Owl Run,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Awesome sled dog trip!!  Would definitely recommend Chilly Dogs. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  They are very caring about the dogs.  They are very thorough about the handling of the sled/dogs and very concerned about everyone's safety.  They make sure you are dressed appropriately for the weather.  Handling the sled/dogs was much easier than expected. Definitely worth a trip to Ely, MN!!"
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,Amazing time!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband has very fond memories of this experience from his childhood, 17 or so years ago. He had been so excited to share this with me, and I was thrilled with this experience! "
Chilly Dogs Sled Dog Trips,5.0,A pawsitively good time! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My partner and I went on a recent dogsledding excursion with Chilly Dogs and it was a really fun way to beat the winter blues! Not only was it an incredibly unique experience, but I personally thought it was awesome that some of the dogs you get to interact with are former Beargrease/Iditarod racers! Seriously, these dogs have accomplished so much and it was so cool to be able to meet them and be pulled by them! It is also incredibly clear that the people at Chilly Dogs are true dog-people. They really want what is best for these special animals and want to educate people about them, which was really amazing to see. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful, and I personally thought the trip packages they offered were quite reasonably priced. If you are coming from a warmer climate and are not accustomed to Northern Minnesota weather, PLEASE heed their what to wear guide- winters there are really no joke. They do offer gear to rent, which can be a lifesaver for the winter- weather novice. All in all it was a great time and a very worthwhile business to patronize. Would definitely sled with them again! "
Roxborough State Park,4.5,Unwelcoming and Costly for Groups,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"This park is very unfriendly to groups, especially tours. In addition to having to pay $30 to apply, which is non-refundable, if you are bringing a group, they want a percentage of the cost of the group tour, as well as admission fees, and a charge for a volunteer docent. They also note than additional fees are at the park admins discretion. While many volunteer docents are good, at these prices, you should have an excellent staff member or be guaranteed a reputable botanist or comparable. Then, if you want to have a group lunch in the park, there are additional fees. No thanks. I will take my group elsewhere."
Roxborough State Park,4.5,High quality hiking and nature experience close to Denver,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"While visiting our daughter in Denver, we spent a morning at this state park.  Wow!  Just outside the Denver metro area, this park delivers a high quality hiking and natural experience.  Get there early in the day, before parking lots fill up and trails get crowded.  There are several trails, ranging from very easy to moderately strenuous.  Views are truly outstanding, and exhibits cover nature and Leave No Trace outdoor ethics.  No dogs allowed.  On hot days, there are benches in shady areas where one can enjoy a cool and relaxing pause.  At the visitor center, there are several picnic tables where one can eat and enjoy the natural ambience.  The vibe is low key, active and family-friendly.  If hiking, be sure to bring plenty of water, and wear hiking footwear.  While hiking, stay on trails (we saw a ranger catch people who had gone off-trail to film a video).  Drones not allowed.  At the visitor center, you can get a brochure that explains various aspects of the natural surroundings on a particular trail (along the trail, there are signs that point out plants, trees, etc)."
Roxborough State Park,4.5,Great place near the city,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was a great place for spending three hours outside during the light winter in Colorado. The weather was great. There was some snow. We went there early afternoon. Because of short winter day in December, we had not much time, but it was enough for us. We spent over three hours walking-hiking around, using the largest loop trail."
Roxborough State Park,4.5,"Serene, Impressive and RED!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Visited this park close to Denver with a 2 year old. We had to wait 15 minutes at park entrance for a parking spot since it was Saturday but the wait was well worth the stunning beauty.  Well kept, well staffed park. No pets.  No climbing on rocks.  PERFECT!"
Roxborough State Park,4.5,Lovely park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved it!  It was like Garden of the Gods without the huge crowds of people.  When we arrived in the morning, it was mostly us and local senior citizens out for a walk.  We saw deer and a turkey crossed the path right in front of us.  The rock formations are wonderful and the Fountain trail is a nice, easy 2 miler.   The only place to picnic is right in front of the visitor's center, which wasn't private and relaxing enough for us."
Roxborough State Park,4.5,Beautiful park with scenic views and easy walking paths,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful state park with scenic views of downtown Denver, fantastic rock formations (like at Garden of the Gods - really amazing), and an easy, well maintained walking trail.  There is a nice covered area near welcome center to rest and have a picnic after 2 mile walk.  There is an old house and other interesting features at the park.  Stop at the Welcome Center.  Nice, clean indoor restrooms and a drinking fountain.  Highly recommend.  Only 40 minutes from downtown Denver - easy drive."

Roxborough State Park,4.5,A Gem of a Park - But Get There Early on Weekends,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just to get this in up-front, no dogs or bikes are permitted in the park. So, if that was your plan, this isn't the right park for you. Also, this park is extremely focused on leaving a minimal footprint on the environment - which is great. But that also means that there are very few parking spots in comparison with other parks of a similar size. So, if you plan to visit on a weekend or holiday, do arrive early. I arrived at 9:30am on a chilly November Saturday and the primary parking lot was already full. "
Roxborough State Park,4.5,Beautiful scenery with lovely walks,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had a very nice loop walk through this park. Nice views and beautiful rock features. We also saw 4 deer during our walk.

Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint,4.5,Pilot Butte Scenic View Platform,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A great little hike to a beautiful view of the Cascade Mountain Range.  It was an easy hike and the views were well worth it.  We even took a stroller.  The locals use this place as a great place to do their walks and  jogs and enjoy the views as they exercise.  Highly recommended.  Very goo parking area, free of charge."
Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint,4.5,A sightseeing must in Bend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Pilot Butte is an interesting landmark right in the middle of Bend.  The view from the top is spectacular and there are displays that identify surrounding mountains off in the distance.  The trail to the top is paved and safe.  There's also a road so you can drive to the top if someone isn't able to hike uphill.  It is definitely worth experiencing.

Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint,4.5,Great View if the Cascades,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"When I first moved to Bend in 1976 I would go up on Pilot Butte almost every day to eat my lunch and enjoy the view. There was hardly ever anyone else up there because Bend was so much smaller back then. It is now usually closed in the winter, to vehical travel (you can still hike up).  Even though it is much more crowded these days it is well were the short drive or hike to the top.  It produces quite a panoramic view of the Cascades, Ochocos and surrounding area."
Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint,4.5,Scenic hiking at Pilot Butter,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Was pleasantly surprised by this gem of a park right near the highway.  Ample parking near children's play area & green grass field, with circular walking trail which allowed further hikes around the Butte base & to the top.  Walks were easy to more difficult on the steep portions, & meandered through wooded areas, or briefly past schoolyards & houses; also offering spectacular  scenic distant vistas of snowy mountains."

Most of Pilot Butte is protected as part of Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint. There are two ways to access the summit - hiking or driving. The hiking trail is short, but steep. For those not wanting the challenge of hiking up the volcano, there is also a road to the top. Normally, I would always prefer to hike up a mountain, but we were running short on time when we visited and had a little trouble finding the parking for hiking. Not wanting to miss the sunset, we drove to the top instead. The views from the top are absolutely beautiful. Pilot Butte is the highest point for miles around so great views of the high desert in all directions. As the sun was going down, looking east we could see the immense shadow of the butte. To the west, we could see the sun setting over the Cascade Mountains, including the Three Sisters, Mount Bachelor, Mount Jefferson, and even Mount Hood in the distance. It would be hard to beat this spot for watching the sunset, so if you're visiting Bend, don't miss out on Pilot Butte."

Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,"Difficult, Hot, Fairyland is better",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Peekaboo loop was the best part of the figure 8 trail we did (Queens Garden to Peekaboo Loop to Wall Street)! We started the trail at 11a from sunrise point (more parking, there was none at sunset point). We went left at the trailhead (starting our descent, not the rim trail). The descent into Queens Garden was super crowded and a little difficult to navigate the families and kids. Would have been best to start earlier. Queens Garden was cool, but Peekaboo loop was the best part of the figure 8 trail! It was pretty difficult and often felt like we were constantly going uphill and the heat was getting to us. There were 2-3 really amazing viewpoints. We ended going back up to sunset point through “Wall Street” which was a terrible series of switchbacks which felt like forever in the blistering heat. Do the “hike the hoodoos” challenge and take a selfie with 3 benchmark signs with the gold coin, go to the visitors center and get a little prize! Overall, fairyland loop is less crowded, more beautiful and just as difficult (it’s longer but they both took the same amount of time). If you want a quicker hoke, Peekaboo Loop is the 2nd best hike in Bryce!! "
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,One of the best trails to see the formations,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the best trails to see the formations, but it comes at the price of steep trails up and down and can be an extra problem in the heat of the summer.  Plan ahead if you are hiking the trail.  Great photo opportunities along the way.  If you are not sure you can hike it, look into the 3 hour horseback ride through the canyon and Peek-a-boo loop.  You will sacrifice some on the photo shooting, but it is less strenuous."
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,Not to be Missed!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an absolutely amazing trip.  We went on the afternoon (half-day) Peek-A-Boo Trail ride.  The company is so well organized and efficient at matching up horses and riders.  The group of 22 was broken up into small groups of 7 or 8 with a guide.  We had Quincy as our guide, who was really outstanding.  He stopped at various points to tell us about Bryce and the viewpoints that we were seeing, answering any questions, and was able to elaborate due to his extensive knowledge.  He had a fantastic personality and told a lot of jokes that added to the experience.  It was scary going around the steep hairpin turns, but he assured us that we were safe and I had to trust in my horse!  At the bottom of the canyon, there was a bathroom break with water for the riders and the horses, before remounting our horse for the ride back up.  Being able to see the amazing Bryce Canyon from rim to bottom was an unforgettable experience!"
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,A Truly Great Hiking Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes, do this trail! Start either at Sunset on the Navajo Loop or at Bryce Point. Once down in the canyon, the trail network will be a system of ups and downs. If you direct yourself toward the formations beneath Inspiration Point first, you'll be sure not to miss the Wall of Windows formation. "
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,"You can't be in a hurry, not a short hike no matter which access you take - but wonderful variety",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The mileage on the park map is misleading.  The loop itself is about five miles, but that's if a helicopter dropped you into the amphitheater so you did not have to hike from an access point.  Regardless, don't rush it.  This is a long hike and sprinkles the sights along the way.  You will talk through forests, long slopes among the rocks, and a wide variety of rock formations.  The trail frequently curves and snakes along so the experience of seeing what is around the next corner or beyond a rock wall is part of the enjoyment.  The trail you choose to access Peekabo will add to the length, but also the enjoyment."
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,"Spectacular, once in a lifetime hike.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely stunning scenery. Really you cannot miss this hike! It is quite ‘up and down’ and tiring, so you need a reasonable fitness level and proper walking shoes, but trust me that it is so worth it! Don’t just do the Queen’s trail - this is so much more magnificent. (Note you can join Peek a Boo from Queen’s and see both - takes about 3 hours with stops). An absolute must. Loved it!"
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,Littered with Horse Droppings,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed many hikes at Bryce Canyon National Park. One particular highlight was hiking from Bryce Point down the Hat Shop Trail.  There were many interesting and unique views along the way down into the canyon. However, at the bottom of the canyon you encounter the Peek-A-Boo Loop trail. This trail is a 3 mile loop that is relatively flat. We started to hike the trail, but quickly found that it is littered with large amounts of horse droppings. That made it rather unpleasant for hiking. If you are riding a horse, this might be a fun trail to take. Otherwise, stick to the other trails in the park."
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,Amazing views! 10/10!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did a combination of the peek a boo, the navajo trail and queens garden (about 11km, with 500m elevation gain). We started at sunrise point and went down then did the peek a boo loop (i recomend going clockwise) and then went up the navajo trail to sunset point."
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,Great hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The loop itself is 3 miles with up and downs. We went from Queen to Navajo to Peek a Boo to Bryce for a total of 5.6 miles and 1234 feet of elevation gain.
Peek-A-Boo Loop,5.0,Fantastic trail with great views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the way to experience Bryce. It was sour first time at Bryce & the shuttle driver recommend peek-a-boo.. we were sure happy we got that recommendation. Hiking into the canyon is an unreal experience in itelf, and this loop winds on and through the hoodoos. It was just spectacular. The hike out of the canyon is strenuous, but very do-able."
Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,Beautiful trails,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trails are beautiful and go for miles. There is abundant flora and fauna. Bathrooms are not close to each other, so if you walk, keep that in mind. Bikers are all over these trails, and can be a bit of a nuisance and safety hazard when they exceed the speed limits. Great place for dog walking, though alligators may be a real threat to small dogs. Also, there are a lot of benches along the way for those who don't like to walk long stretches all at once. "
Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,Beautiful well-kept trails,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a surprising find with the trail head along the main road. The trails were well kept and it should have been a peaceful walk. However, there were no maps available and we had to rely on the internet to figure out our hike, as the distances given on the signs are only an indication of where the next turn may be. The biggest issue were the sheer number of bicycles traveling at a good speed along the same 2-person wide trail. My husband and I could not walk side by side without constantly being on the lookout for cyclists who seemed to think they had the right of way. I would suggest separate paths or better rules for the cyclists. Truly took the serenity from our hike "

Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,What an amazing trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My daughter and I rode bikes (complimentary from the hotel) each day we were in Gulf Shores.  Through four days of riding (anywhere from 10-18 miles per day), we pretty much covered the entire park and all the trails.  What a great time we had, riding through all various types of scenery.  We got to see alligators and a tortoise, as well as numerous cool birds.  We both absolutely loved our time riding through these trails.  "
Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,"Highly recommend for cyclists, walkers, and runners",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I rode these trails for a couple hours, two days while we were in town for a week.

Beautiful views, nice and shaded - highly recommend for cyclists, walkers, or runners."
Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,Well maintained paved trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Comfortable walk on paved walkways and boardwalk paths. Biking, roller blades, walking along treelined paths. Saw a gopher tortoise hiding in the sand, an eagle flew by, butterflies at the garden, mother alligator and two of her babies.  Thankfully alligator was temporarily behind a wire fence so we could walk passed with our labrador. Very pet friendly. Many more miles to explore. "
Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,Great easy walking trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great biking and walking trails through the marshes and woods.

Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,An amazing day of outdoor adventure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I rode this trail years ago and loved it. We decided to go back this weekend, and we were surprised to find that it is now even better than it was when we first gave it a go. There were plenty of CLEAN bathrooms, shaded benches, observations points, and well paved trails!. It made for an amazing day of outdoor adventures. We will definitely be returning!"
Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,Fun little trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented a tandem bicycle at Beach Bike Rentals and had a great time. We could have spent more time here but just did the 8 mile loop. We saw two baby alligators, a tortoise, and a couple of eagles. It is a really nice, well maintained path. I would totally recommend this as a relaxing outdoor adventure."
Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail,4.5,diversion from the beach,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A fun place to go away from the beach for awhile.  We did see 1 small alligator.  The best part by far was the ability to use bikes that are in the park for free for 3 hrs (just have to download the app).  It was the easiest way to get around and made our time there much more enjoyable.  
Big Bear Lake,4.5,Uh...where's the lake? What is there to do in summer?,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is our first time coming to Big Bear Lake in the summer with the kids. We picked a cabin so we can walk to the village and onto the lake's edge. Unfortunately, where we stayed just happened to be the area where the lake is receding.  The boats and dock are sitting in mud. News outlets weren't exaggerating. The drought has really affected the lake. There is not much to do here. The village is really small and many are not masking or socially distancing. If you're wearing a mask be ready to be stared at and hear some snickering or mumbling under their breaths. Crave Maine Lobster is AHMAZING, but be ready to pay $26 & change for a lobster roll. Could not find a decent coffee shop that is open before 8am. Settled for Dank Donuts, but tossed it and the inedible donuts.  We wanted dinner @Bone Side Down BBQ, but it closes at 5pm! There is a lot of hiking to do and the trails are not crowded. The playground at Ski Beach Park is SO small & boulder park is small. We skipped the slide rides as there were so many people in line packed like sardines.  Overall, the kids were not thrilled. Winter in Big Bear is the way to go."

Restaurants equal to anything down the hill and funky old places to get a home made ice cream cone that will melt in your hands ( enuf to lick off, one of the best things to do). There is a multitude of things going on at all times, you will not be disappointed, Disneyland and Knots Berry farm all in one place, Then the lake in summer, winter sports to delight all ages. Shopping, visitors center, museum with  old buildings you can walk through and a working blacksmith shop. Fishing, lake and boating activities, celebrations galore, horseback riding, the NEW ZOO, churches  for all and then there are the friendliest folks who live and work there. Strike up a conversation, you are at home."

Big Bear Lake,4.5,"BIG BEAR LAKE OKTOBERFEST FOOD, BEER AND MUSIC!!!!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family and I started attending the Big Bear Lake Oktoberfest several years ago. This event is a Fall tradition with a building built to look like a tent with authentic German bands, food, deserts and of course many incredible imported beer selections like Franziskaner Hefe-Weissbier and Hofbräu München. FIRST I have to compliment Kasandra, manager of the Oktoberfest. We had several interactions with her during the 2022 Oktoberfest after attending multiple times throughout September-October. She is kind, gracious and an incredible host! "
Big Bear Lake,4.5,Big Bear Snow ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Big Bear is a great destination for those who want to experience the snow. Going to give you a couple of helpful tips to be prepared & help out the locals a bit. First, be prepared! Most underestimate the snow & go in tennis or bearpaw boots & none water proof gloves, pants & jackets. I know it can be expensive, so buy everything at a second hand store or eBay, but trust me! You want to be prepared or you will get ALL WET! Take everything you need with you, some convenience store are ridiculously overpriced! We do have StaterBros, Vons & Dollar Tree but always super busy & out of certain necessities. Traffic jams & parking, pretty please be considerate of the locals & don’t block or park in their driveways. Please look for other ways to get to your destination to help minimize traffic jams, back streets etc. Last but not least, try to park far & walk a bit, use this time to chat with your family, exercise a bit lol this helps out a lot with traffic jams & congestion. Hope this helps a bit & enjoy! "
Big Bear Lake,4.5,Avoid this place,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Extremely disappointed with this lake community.  Not a good vibe going on here like other mountain towns. Plain, boring, and not very scenic.  Lack of snow and drought is taking a toll. Resorts can barely stay open and only with snow-making most of the year. A lot of the trees are dead. Big Bear Lake is a dying lake, and drying up fast (the adjoining 'lake', Baldwin, has already dried up!!).  No comparison to Mammoth nor Sierras. Basically a place for the riffraff of San Bernardino to come escape the heat."

The local drivers go up and down Hwy. 330 likes bats out of Hades, tailgating at way above speed limit and hugging your bumper. One of our party was nearly run off the (cliff) side of the road by an F-150 doing an illegal pass in my friend's lane going the wrong way! We had to pull over multiple times in each direction due to aggressive tailgaters even though we were going the speed limit on narrow, steep and windy road."

Big Bear Lake,4.5,Lift Line Hack (but only at Snow Summit),2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just a quick piece of advice if you ski at Snow Summit. Always, always, always take the singles line, even if in a large group. On lifts 1, 2 and 3, they will allow you to go as a group once you are at the front of the singles line. It will save you between 20-25 minutes in those lines."
Canyon Trail,4.5,great trek -  parking trick,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Most  people park up in the road and makes the hike much longer going down the gravel road with no views. When you see the Koke'e state Park sign on your right, veer right and take a gravel road, it seems to be a quite steep  (it is indeed if you hike it up)  but we did it with a sedan and didn't have any problem going up and down, when you hit a fork turn right and the parking is right there. The trail is stuck to the parking."

Canyon Trail,4.5,"Fun hike, wear hiking boots",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the trail to the waterfall. I do not like heights or cliffs so I did not make it all the way to the waterfall, but the views I did see were gorgeous. I stopped at the huge cliff before the waterfall, but my family made it there and enjoyed it. It is supposed to be moderate in difficulty, and I think that’s about right, keeping in mind that’s for regular hikers. I do not hike regularly, and would have been fine if I wore hiking boots. The hike was not on our itinerary and my sneakers were barely good enough for paved streets. It rained several times during the hike, and it was quite muddy."
Canyon Trail,4.5,Canyon Trail honest review ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Incredible views of the canyon at the last km of the hike, the waterfall is a bit underwhelming. I recommend hiking boots and poles as the track is quite muddy. Make sure you follow the trail on the right before the falls as that takes you to another incredible view of the canyons. "
Canyon Trail,4.5,Challenging for Non Hikers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to hike a short distance on the trail see the views and walk back.  The first part of the trial is wooded, no real views. It was muddy and slippery in places.  We continued on and walked the entire trail plus a side hike to the waterfall. It was challenging for us as we do not hike often but we were able to do it. Be sure to bring water. The views along the canyon rim are spectacular and the waterfall was a very nice place to just sit and relax before starting back. On the way back we opted to take the dirt road for 4WD vehicles back to the main road as we were not sure we would make it back up the trail through the muddy part."
Canyon Trail,4.5,Beautiful but slippery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't look up. The second you do you will trip! This is a beautiful hike but it was slippery to start with and then it began to rain for over an hour and the clay-like dirt turned into slick mess. I felt bad for the people who were coming down as we were finishing and I hope no one got hurt. I saw a lot of people slipping and falling along the way.
Canyon Trail,4.5,"Beautiful views, quite steep",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a fun hike to the top of Waiapo’o Falls, but as others have mentioned, parts are really steep. Don’t attempt it with small kids or if you have knee issues.  It’s not super long - you need to be stable on your feet. You definitely get some breathtaking views, but it’s a very popular hike, so prepare for it to be busy. If you don’t want to do the Canyon Trail, you can get a similarly great view just by doing the Cliffs Trail, which branches to the right at the trailhead. (Signs are there to mark which is which.). Cliffs Trail is only a quarter mile or so a little uphill on a wide, clear path and ends at a vista.  Avoid the Black Pipe turnoff when doing the Canyon Trail - it’s overgrown in many places, isn’t well marked at some turnoffs, and doesn’t have any views to speak of."
Canyon Trail,4.5,Visit the Waipo'o Falls!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Take this trail to the falls. You can skip the hike and drive down a dirt road, if you have a 4x4, but the views of Waimea Canyon are gorgeous if you take the full version. Bring a good hat/sunscreen, solid shoes if it's wet/muddy, and your camera. Such a great time in nature!"
Canyon Trail,4.5,Nothing Spectacular,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We do a ton of hiking and were looking forward to this 4 mile out and back jaunt. Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations. The trail is rugged with tree roots tripping those not paying attention. I don’t think the trail ever dries out, so it’s a slippery mess going downhill regardless of your shoe style. Most of the way in is through the trees with no hint of the magnificent canyon a few feet to the right. One nice overlook of the canyon on a short spur to the right. Otherwise, continue down to the falls which, to me, didn’t seem worth the effort. The overlooks along the drive were far more impressive. Not worth the 2.5 hours effort, not to mention potential slippage with every step."
Canyon Trail,4.5,"Nice ride to view Waimea Canyon,  beautiful scenery.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is easy to see why Waimea Canyon is called the Grand Canyon of Hawaii.

Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Easy to See,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We arrived at arches National Park just before sunrise to avoid the traffic that shows up by 9 o'clock. The park is usually closed by 10:00 a.m. because of excessive traffic. We happened to be at balanced rock at sunrise which was a great experience since the Sun rises behind it. It has a nice parking lot and even if you don't walk the trail you can easily see the formation from the parking lot.
Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Beautiful at Sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I headed here as my first stop when arriving at Arches in the evening to experience sunset and it was very cool. The colors on the rock formation are amazing at this time of the day. Easily accessible off the main scenic road through the park and easy to walk the short trail around the formation. Also a great place to come for stargazing at night.
Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Appropriate for all ages and fitness levels,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Balanced Rock, a huge sandstone block that appears to balance precariously on a thin rock column, is one of the most popular attractions within Arches National Park.  It is located next to the park’s main road, a little over 9 miles/14.5 km from the park entrance.  It has the distinction of being one of only a few of the park’s best-known features to be clearly visible from the road."

Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Must stop and walk around the short trail at the rock,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We walked around the rock on the short trail that goes around it.  This was fantastic as the balanced rock looked different from every angle and light on it.  It is very interested how it has not fallen YET.  Must do
Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Walk the easy trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Quite amazing that the rock looks different at different angle when walking around the base. One side is flat like a wall and then it looks like a football from another of side of the trail. This is a popular spot because the ease of accessibility to the base. This is very close to the entrance, suggestion is to stop by on the way out of the park."
Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Non Arch Feature in Arches NP,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the attractions in Arches NP is Balanced Rock.  It is a really cool formation to see but it kind of gets lost with all the arches.  Still it is in the center of the park with its own parking area.  You will pass it going to most of the big arch attractions in the park.  We stopped to see it and take a group picture here as a rain storm moved across the park, kind of cool experience."
Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Arches National Park Must-See,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice, simple trail that gives you amazing views. Most areas are easily accessible for everyone, but there are more challenging ones for those that are a bit more daring. Bring water and hold onto your hat, follow the trail markers and take advantage of the cool photo opportunities. Parking was easy and Balance Rock is a must-see while visiting Arches National Park."
Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Stunning Sunrise Locale,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked the Balanced Rock Trail as the sun rose over the La Sal Mountains to the east. The hike was low-intensity which was a good start to the day’s hiking. The scenery and views were amazing! The red rock formations were beautiful. A number of different desert plants were found along the trail as well. This was a great place to get introduced to Arches.
Balanced Rock Trail,4.5,Balancing Act,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Arches in Arches NP are amazing, but this stop is  different and just as amazing. A natural geological rock formation that is quite the site. There is a short hike around the formation, but the the balancing rock can easily been seen from the parking lot area. Great photo opportunities and worth a visit to this location in the park."
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Is it possible to be better than Zion?  Yes without the crowds!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Honestly, for moderate hikers from Colorado, this hike impressed us more than Zion did. Part of that delight was the fact that it wasn’t as crowded but a beautiful slot canyon awaited us at the end of the hike. The ladder was available at the big drop (for non technical hikers) so we had no problem continuing on to the end of Wire Pass.  What a beautiful area!  Easy hike with big payoff on views and fun."
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Spring Break in Arizona,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did this hike last week while in Arizona for Spring Break.  We got an early start and drove from Flagstaff to the Wire pass trail head.  Reading the reviews I had bought and printed our pass ahead of time.  We started the hike shortly before 9am and had 2 adults and 4 kids ages 8-14.  The trailhead was not busy when we started which was great because we got amazing pictures and got to experience the slot canyons almost completely to ourselves.  We hiked to buckskin and then turned right and hiked a little farther through the canyon.  We also found the petroygyphs on the right before you merge with buckskin.  All in all the experience was incredible and well worth the drive.  I was disappoined knowing antelope canyon and horseshoe canyon are still closed but this hike cost our family of 6 $36 and antelope would have been close to $360.  We had the canyon to ourselves and outside of the awful bumpy road to get there it was absolutely amazing!  I highly recommend.  Although I will say the trailhead was insanely busy when we finished so I am not sure I would have loved the experience as much if the trail was busy.
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Excellent,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Breathtaking sites!  It was worth the 8 mile washboard road from the highway to the trailhead.  It is a VERY bumpy road to get there, but so worth it!  Get there early, so you can find parking.  We learned early on for every attraction in Utah, get there early, leave early to avoid the crowds.  Lots of international tourism everywhere right now.  Bring plenty of water & good hiking shoes.  If there is storm clouds overhead, don't hike that day, you wouldn't get out of the slot canyons fast enough if there was a flash flood, so pay attention to the weather.  We bought our trail pass ahead of time & printed it out.  At this time, it's $6 a person and $6 per dog.  It's hard not to take an amazing picture on this trail.  This was one of the highlights of our trip."
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Must do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wirepass slot canyon is very narrow and interesting. We went on Thanksgiving, and there was a ladder to get down the rockfall. We saw the trail that went around the ladder (if it isn't there, like if it gets washed away), and it is just a trail on the slickrock. Dogs could make the side trail very easy, and it would be fine for people, too; if you are afraid of heights, you can shimmy down on your butt without tearing the seat of your pants.  Wirepass has some rocks blocking the narrow slot, and you have to do a bit of bouldering to get past them. But otherwise, the path is sandy with some rocky sections.  When we got to Buckskin, we went right (that was where most people were going), and we hiked to the 'lookout,' where the narrow slot canyon opens up (about 3 miles from the start of the hike). Buckskin has some rocky sections that turn to (kind of) deep sand.  The canyon walls are a lot taller than Wirepass, but you don't have to climb over borders (or under trees that block the canyon).    We saw the old ladder from Wirepass about 20 feet above us in the Buckskin canyon.  I guess the last flash flood took it down the canyon.  The road to the (large) parking lot at the beginning of the hike would be passable in sedans - it was dry.  The outside temperature was about 50 for the high; it was a little chilly in the canyon. I had on two synthetic shirts and a fleece jacket, and I was fine.  My kids wore synthetic shirts and sweatshirts.  "
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,New Love,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a great hike. It’s not difficult and the scenery was gorgeous. The slot canyons were very cool and we even found petroglyphs (?) at the end. The whole family loved it and they are a picky bunch. I would love to do this again and explore even farther. (March 2021).
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Another Planet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wire Pass was a huge highlight on our trip.
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked about 10 miles of Wire Pass/Buckskin Gulch. The access road — House Rock Rd — to the trailhead is 8.3 miles of small ruts and washboard but it’s passable as long as it isn’t wet. The hike through the slot in Wire Pass  is relatively packed down, is easily negotiated, even the ladder section  over the boulder blockage. Exiting the Wire Pass trail look low on the rock face to the right for petroglyphs. Turning left (north) into Buckskin Leads again to more of the slot canyon which is again easily negotiated. This section widens in a mile or so and eventually leads to the Upper Buckskin trailhead. Returning then heading south in Buckskin Gulch rewards you with more of the slot canyon, widens at Buckskin Overlook then continues on for miles. "
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Great Hike with Unique Features,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hike in a stunning slot canyon with many unique features. Vivid array of colors and formations with a chance to view some rock art along the way. Fun hike for families!
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Very worthwhile... chance to see a slot canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wire Pass Trailhead and Buckskin Gulch Trailhead in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah us about a 1 hour drive from Page, AZ"
Wire Pass Trail (Buckskin Gulch Access),5.0,Amazing slot canyon.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an easy to find, fairly easy hike.  We were a little nervous about hiking into Buckskin Gulch because of what we had read in the hike description we received at the visitor center.  But, this was an easy hike that most people should be able to do.  We only hiked a few miles into the canyon, then turned around to head back out.  It was a gorgeous, hike amongst the sheer cliff walls, the debris trapped in the upper reaches of the slots, the rubble on the floor of the canyon, a very fun hike.  This slot canyon is 21 miles total, but you certainly can stop at any point you want to.  I would imagine, the farther you go in, the more intense the hike could become.  The first few miles were a breeze though.  "
Cascade River State Park,4.5,"Excitement, Rapids and Fun",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"To say that the parks and hiking on Highway 61 are incredible is a tremendous understatement.  Each one is so amazing and diverse, but each seems to be better than the last.  Cascade River State Park was my 3rd favorite Minnesota park on Highway 61 which may not sound good until you realize there are more than 10 incredible state parks to see here.  It does not have the sweeping lakeshore views or most impressive waterfalls.  However, what it does have is the most amazing river with rapids and tight gorge that produce more noise and action than any other river on the North Shore.  The main rapid trail is 1.1 miles round trip with just over 200 vertical feet."
Cascade River State Park,4.5,Great Surprise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This park was not on our itinerary, so it was a delightful, unexpected find.  Parking was easy off Route 61.   The ""hike"" to the falls was short, easy, and tree-lined.  The falls and river were particularly interesting due to their rusty color.  And there were some dizzying views looking down along the falls' paths.  This is a quick & easy (though one can connect with more challenging trails), and definitely worthwhile stop for anyone driving Lake Superior's north shore."
Cascade River State Park,4.5,"Picturesque waterfalls close to park entrance, also accessible from Hwy. 61 parking area.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful series of waterfalls with easy access from Hwy. 61 if you just have time for a quick visit or are not up to a long hike. We entered through the park and enjoyed several views of the falls within yards of our car! We did not venture all the way to the “lookout” (beyond the falls) because it was quite foggy that day and we met up with a couple who talked us out of it (in a good way). We were making our way along the 1.5 mile loop (not the Superior Hiking Trail). They said they were coming from a trail entrance on Hwy 45 (?) and advised that we had already seen the most beautiful part of the park. We kept going for a bit and true to their advice, the footing became challenging with tangles of cypress roots and the views less interesting. I like to think that on a day with less dense fog we might have pressed on to the lookout to reap the reward of the promised view! Next time."
Cascade River State Park,4.5,Certain Park rangers need to RETIRE!,2.0 of 5 bubbles,It's obvious that father time needs to be done managing this Park. Its memorial day weekend and old man hasn't come to check on anyone. People are burning garbage and half of the  people here are breaking State Park vehicle rules. Why is the Park changing full price when Santa isn't opening the showers for us because he doesn't want to clean... this is bull s and you know it DNR.
Cascade River State Park,4.5,Some of the best waterfall hiking anywhere,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have also stayed in the Cascade River campground, which is nice, but this review is about the hiking.  I hiked up the Cascade River with my wife, young child and teenager last week. We started from the parking area on the highway and went a couple miles each way (spending maybe a couple hours), which took us past splendid waterfall after waterfall. The trail goes through lovely forest on the way too. Lots of overlooks with benches suitable for picnics.  Be aware this is not disabled-accessible, as it is a true hiking trail with roots, rocks and steps.  For the more adventurous, you can continue up to six miles in (past more waterfalls!) and connect with the Superior Hiking Trail. Really one of the best waterfall spots on Lake Superior's North Shore, and that's saying something."
Cascade River State Park,4.5,Recommended for a hike of say 4-5 hours.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great location across from Lake Superior. Beautiful creeks and waterfalls throughout, not too crowded, and the hiking was relatively easy - though if you spent a few hours here, you got a great workout. Not too crowded, great for families."
Cascade River State Park,4.5,Hiking the Cascade River Trail at Cascade River State Park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Good trip. We arrived at approximately 5:45 pm and made our way towards the entrance of the trail. The majority of the trail was paved, and there were several sets of stairs to climb up and down on, as we walked closer towards the waterfall. We saw the cascades first, and then made a loop to see the actual waterfall. The trail was not marked and we actually made a wrong turn before getting back on the path we were supposed to be on. The waterfall was decent in size, and we were able to climb on some of the rocks to get a better view. We continued on the trail until we saw where the waterfall ended."
Cascade River State Park,4.5,Hiking to see the waterfalls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We spent a few hours hiking the trails to see the waterfalls on the Cascade River.   Family out to the north shore to see peak fall colors and enjoy nature.   Took our 5 kids and they were able to do all the hiking.   The is a gorgeous spot that empties out to Lake Superior.
Cascade River State Park,4.5,Perfect hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We started at the Cascade Lodge where we stayed and walked up to Lookout Mountain (not in the park) than into the upper falls. The trails were well marked and travelled. And the trail was easy. The views were spectacular from the mountain and the falls well breathtaking! We had lunch riverside. Loved this park!
Cascade River State Park,4.5,Nice trails-very buggy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked for over 14 miles on 2 different days in this park. Lovely waterfalls, lots of neat (and some shabby/scary) bridges, boards and walkways. Tons of wildflowers, surprisingly little wild animals (that we saw). We walked from Cascade Lodge to the falls then up to Lookout Mountain. Somehow we got turned around on our way back and ended up past Camp Creek! We knew something was wrong when we were going uphill both ways haha. We had to backtrack and then take a ski trail to Highway 61 and walk the highway for a mile back to the lodge. That part was scary because there's lots of semis and the shoulder is very narrow! Tons of mosquitoes/deer flies on the regular trails, and when we got to the ski trail we had to remove about 20 wood ticks as we were walking, gross! Definitely should have looked at GPS on my phone sooner. We had bug spray too, it didn't help."
Riverwalk,4.5,Park like walk along the river,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful walk way with landscaping, playgrounds, shady seating, waterfalls and views.  We enjoyed walking with the bikers, runners and fog walkers.  There were some picnicking & lists of events scheduled here."
Riverwalk,4.5,Nice Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I spent a little time wandering the Riverwalk and was impressed with the views. I also really liked the swings that were available. I don't know what type of parking is available as I was staying in a hotel less than 1/2 mile away from it.
Riverwalk,4.5,"""Relaxing Walk""",5.0 of 5 bubbles,Riverwalk is so relaxing and you can see everything from the many bridges to Newport on the Levee across the river. Many gardens and children activities. Gonna miss spending time here.
Riverwalk,4.5,"Free, Fun, and Family Friendly",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a very night park to go visit. We walked from our hotel. There were swings, fun things for kids of all ages to play on, and a really nice view. The flying pig and water features were favorites of my family."
Riverwalk,4.5,Good,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Did the Ohio side of walk and was peaceful with little history lessons on the way. Perfect for a stroll after a good lunch. The brown river isn’t picturesque but it serves its purpose. Great for running/workout as well
Riverwalk,4.5,"Lots to See and Do Walking Near Ohio River on Both Cincinnati, Ohio and Newport/Covington, Kentucky Sides",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is much to see and do while walking near the Ohio River, both on the Cincinnati, Ohio side and the Newport/Covington, Kentucky side."
Riverwalk,4.5,Very Pretty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The riverwalk is super pretty and a relaxing environment. You can see the city but its right on the Ohio River. I loved walked across the bridge straight into Kentucky and being able to see both the football and baseball stadiums. 
Riverwalk,4.5,Great walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great circular walk, which can extended to see a number of the sights on the Cincinnati side of the Ohio River.    I parked in the underground car park in Newport on the levee.($2 for the day). I did the full walk and with stopping for photos etc it took 2 hours, but next time it will take 1 1/ hours."
Riverwalk,4.5,December 2013 on the Riverwalk in Cincinnati OH and Covington KY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"An incredible photo walk!  The weather was very cooperative with sun and 50 degrees.  great place to spend a day walking, experiencing history, eating, playing and more.  Had lunch at Moerlein Lager House, then playing on the swings, then a photo walk across the Roebling Suspension Bridge.  Finished walking down the Covington KY side of the Ohio River enjoying restored Civil War era homes and river walk statue tour.  I passed many smiling people enjoying the day.  Recommended for all ages."
Riverwalk,4.5,Beautiful and lots to do.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took our kiddos to the Riverfront and it was beautiful. There were water spouts for them to play in and they were even having a puppet show that was free. It was so good. The bridges are beautiful, there is a labyrinth to walk, you can rent bikes...so much to do and see! We will def. go back on our next trip to Ohio."
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Lovely Place,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great place for a walk with children and to get out of the city for an hour or two without having to go camping or on a hiking trail. My family loved the redwood area, those trees are amazing! Too bad the tea house was closed to the public... overall is great! "
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Beautiful Gardens,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"These are beautiful botanic gardens with a variety of plant life- from a meadow filled with flowers, to wooded trails, to cacti and herbs. It is compact and easy to navigate, but feels worlds away from the tourist areas of Santa Barbara. Set in the foothills above the city, the winding drive up offers wonderful views. The gardens include a nice gift shop and nursery. The trails can be a bit strenuous, as some are steep."
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Rather limited with not much to actually see,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We were a bit disappointed with the botanical garden although appreciate the climate might make it difficult to grow a wide variety of plants and flowers- we felt it didn’t represent value for money $16 per adult. There just wasn’t much to see. The meadow  was probably the nicest area. The volunteers were enthusiastic and friendly; and clearly very passionate about the garden was okay and filled an hour but wouldn’t rush back.
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Worth the visit!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My friend and I wanted some exercise while on vacation but were not wanting a long hike, this was the perfect place. I bought tickets online though their website for a Tuesday when it opened at 10:00 a.m. "
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,"One of the best private garden experiences we have had, anywhere.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our experience at the SB Botanic Garden was one of the high points  of our two day trip to Santa Barbara.  The 100 year old garden is nestled on 82 pristine acres north of the city, and offers miles of walking trails, through meadows, myriad wildflowers, bird life, and a wonderful grove of redwood trees at the northern part of the park.  The staff were knowledgeable, and extemely helpful.  Two definite thumbs up from us both."
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Red Woods area was impressive,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our visit was average. Probably b/c of the time of year, early November.  I think the best time would be Spring as the snow melt flows though the river on the garden grounds.  Without it and without the blooms and color, we simply were walking thru the woods.  My wife said many time ""this is more of a nature preservation than garden"""
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Great Garden with Native Plants,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful property in the hills of Santa Barbara.  The highlight of the tour was our Tour Guide, Lori Robinson!  Her knowledge, enthusiasm and honest concern for the preservation of all of our natural flora and fauna was very impressive.  The tour was especially nice because of her knowledge.  I highly recommend touring this garden"
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Don’t miss the ocean view area ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lovely gardens. We went in late February and were happy to see the California poppies in bloom.  This is not just a walk around a few paths to see flowers, it also includes dirt and forest type paths.  There is a small area with redwood trees.  It’s a great place for children and includes some play structures.  If you have any mobility issues or won’t be comfortable walking across rocks, be sure to pay attention to the staff as they describe the various trails.  It is possible to do only the main, easy surface path and avoid the side paths with more challenging walking.  Don’t miss the area across the street where there is a mountain and ocean view and some of the most beautiful floral areas.   Clean restrooms and a nice gift shop.  "
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Natural Adventure & Beauty Away From the City.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A lovely venue to feel and experience the natural beauty of Santa Barbara & So Cal. Natural and paved paths, dry creek, 1806 built bridge still in use, & the original water source of the Santa Barbara Mission. Redwoods trees, native plant nursery & friendly staff & docents to share info. Families of all ages, even future Olympic climbers  of 4 yo enjoyed the boulders and paths of adventure. A good stop to add to a day trip to SB for those of us from LA. "
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden,4.0,Nothing2c,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a complete waste of our precious $25. We even paid the $1.00 help the garden fee. Except there is no garden. What garden? We were bored out of our wits. One can enjoy all what we saw and more for FREE! Needless to say, WE WON'T BE COMING BACK!"
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,Challenging Trail in Both Directions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the toughest hike we have had in the Smokey Mountains.  The sign says it is 1.75 miles to the end of the trail.  Our hiking app said we walked a little over two miles up the mountain gaining 1,442 feet of altitude.  This trail has over 600 steps (we did not count them but saw someone report it on YouTube – so it has to be right 😉).  We would not question that number.  It seemed every turn there were more stairs to endure.  We thought we were in decent hiking shape having hiked two 6K peak mountain tops just a couple weeks ago.  This one was more difficult for us than that trail.  It is the continual climb that is the difficult part."
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,Strenuous trail - worth the effort,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you can handle a strenuous trail 1.8 miles up (3.6 miles RT) then this is a must do hike for you! We planned accordingly and the pay off of the view from the official end is totally worth it. You are NOT supposed to hike past the gate onto the actual chimney top but when we got to the top, people were on it coming down. Even if the trail was open, I would not attempt it; too treacherous. So still worth it to see the view at the end."
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,Well-done trail but a challenging hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Extremely well-done trail with fantastic views. My heartfelt thanks to everyone who has no doubt put countless hours into building and maintaining this trail.  It is a challenging trail with lots and lots of steps and while the view at the end is breathtaking, there are many opportunities along the way to see beautiful streams and other beautiful valley views. We arrived at the trailhead around 8am and were some of the first hikers there but by the time we got off the trail about 10:30am, people were already fighting for our parking space, so I would suggest arriving relatively early."
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,"Difficult trail, but worth the view!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very difficult trail with many steep climbs and stairs. It is almost 100% uphill on the way to the view the chimney tops. The view is great with panoramic views of the mountains and great shots of the chimney tops. When we went, the trail over to the chimney tops was closed due to the wild fires a few years earlier. Probably not a great choice for younger children  as they will find this very difficult and boring. The hike up to the top does not offer very many views of anything exciting. This is also a very popular trail with limited parking at the trail head, there is more parking on the side of the road though. "
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,It's a 5 mile round trip to the top. Don't let the signs fool you.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The bridges and waterfalls on the first part are beautiful ❤️ The trail is strenuous. If you're not used to walking uphill even a little bit it may not be the hike for you. It will take two hours to get to the top if you're walking with young kids. And our mile tracker counted over 5 miles round trip and not the 3.3 miles we saw advertised.
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,Worth the Treak,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great day hike for anyone who is visiting the Smokey mountains. If you only have one day to hike, I would highly suggest this one. The only real negative thing about it is that the best part of the trail is gated off. Most people just walk around it and keep walking. I understand that the last part (the part shut off) was closed after the big fire. Unfortunately, this section has the best views. There are some tricky spots to navigate and I can see why they shut it off, but if you want really good photos, you have to do some real mountain climbing. One note- this is a short trail (4 miles too) but is is a steep 1400 foot incline. Easy to walk trails. The bathroom is at the picnic area, a few miles down the road before you get to the trail head. "
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,Difficult Trail with a lot of incline,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is beautiful don’t get me wrong.  You walk along a river at the base of the trail and it’s awesome.  But this trail is also very tough with a 1,200 ft. elevation ascent to the top.  It’s 2 miles to the top from the base and the trail is very doable but be ready to climb a lot of stairs and have an elevated heart rate. Make sure bring enough water and you’re fine.  Not being able to go all the way to the chimney tops is a little bit of a bummer, but the view at the top is still pretty cool. "
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,Amazing views from the start- great photo op if you can not make it to the top!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So if you do not have the ability to walk the entire trail, the short walk will reward you with a little waterfall and a beautiful bridge and scenery and make for some great photo opportunities. I do not think there would have been anyway I could have made the entire hike/walk to the top. I was able to get through Laurel Falls and Grotto Falls but this is a much tougher walk/hike and terrain. Important to note the other hikes were not done in the same day nor in days next to each other. I spaced them out so I could enjoy the nature trails and Gods beauty. I took my time along with my friends and we chatted along the way and stopped for photo opportunities on the way up and back on the various trails. I do wish people would learn how dangerous the paths are and not think flip flops are appropriate footwear on a hike/walk. Remember to always take water and trash bags"
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,Great hike in the Smokies,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was humid but sunny and a great introduction to hiking in the Smokies.  The trail is very well maintained but it is a steep 1.8-mile hike to the observation post, but a relatively easy downhill on the same stair-filled trail.  Trailhead was filled by 8 am on a Wednesday and I passed about 100 people so you will be sharing the trail.  Sadly, I saw no bears on this day."
Chimney Tops Trail,4.5,Tough but worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our family of 4 (2 adults in average shape, 2 teens) made it up to the lookout (as far as you can currently go) in just over an hour and back down in just under an hour. The hike to the top is ALL UPHILL! And as tough as that was (on the cardio side), coming down was even harder (on the legs and knees). Pack snacks and water. You can sit at the top and enjoy the view for as long as you want (as long as it takes to get up the strength to hike back down). Make sure once you get to the top, to go just past the landing to the left for a nice photo opp. The trail itself is absolutely gorgeous! If you choose to just do the lower portion and not climb a single step, you'll still see some of the best scenery around. We got lucky and found a parking space at the trailhead at noon on a Friday. There were other people on the trail but nothing crazy. Not too crowded at all. Easy to let others pass. If you can stand the climb, I recommend this hike."
Animas River Trail,4.5,Nice River Bike And Walk Experience,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail pretty much follows the river north-south through Durango. Actually there are many access points, so find a city map and determine which sector you'd like to negotiate. If you're biking (and there are many bikers) it's easy to do the whole length. but walkers would probably want to be more selective. I used the GPS and it started me out on the east side near the hospital on Rivergate. I took the footbridge across and then turned north into the downtown area. If you're interested in playing in the water, that's possible too. There are many access points to rocky beach fronts and though, the August water seemed too low for boating, I did see several trying their hands at it by the deeper pools near the downtown."
Animas River Trail,4.5,Great little Trail! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stopped at St. Lucia park in Durango before checking into our hotel. It's a beautiful park with lots of green space , children's playground,  access to rafting  and water play. What a great gem we discovered in this hiking/ biking trail that runs along the river. It's a well maintained paved path with access to downtown or anywhere else you'd like to go in the city. Lots of shade, and runs through several parks. We had our mountain bikes and I'm glad because of some uneven pavement.   There's a small mountain bike track that runs off the path at St. Lucia park. Most of the path is level, with very few climbs. On our way back we stopped at the Animas River Brewery at the Doubletree Inn. It's right on the path and has bike racks.  We had beer and hard cider,  but there were also food offerings.  A great reward for the ride! "
Animas River Trail,4.5,River Surfing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful walk along the Animas River.  Near the sewage plant we watched river surfers...something we had never seen before, along with kayakers and river rafters.  Lots of sun, shade and places to sit and just reflect."
Animas River Trail,4.5,Watch for bikes,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The trail is delightful and accessible for those with walking difficulties. It's paved and level. The views of the river are beautiful and there are benches periodically for a short rest and to enjoy the view and people watch. We were there Saturday morning of Labor Day weekend and our concern was the large number of bikes sharing the trail. There were times we had to scamper off the path as bikes were approaching from both directions. It made the walk more stressful than it should have been. 
Animas River Trail,4.5,Frustrating,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"I think this trail would be great for a casual walk or a run.  For cycling, it is not so good, at times even dangerous.  I had my sun glasses on as it was sunny.  I saw shade up ahead, it looked like an underpass for a road.   No, the trail just ended, I was lucky not to crash.   Cyclists and walkers take up the entire road, and do not seem to understand ""on your left.""  Sometimes there is a divergence, and which way to go is not well  marked.     It is very crowded.    The surface is at times pretty uneven.  Maybe I have been spoiled by the Bosque trail in Albuquerque,  but my recommendation is to avoid this if cycling."
Animas River Trail,4.5,Lovely River Walkway Perfect for Stretching your Legs or Walking your Canine,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Staying at the United RV park on the north side of town, we wanted to take our pooch on a short walk by the river.  Just down the road a bit is the start of the Animas River Trail.  A pretty trail and mostly paved, we wandered along the beautiful Animas river and enjoyed the morning coolness.  Note:  always be on the alert for bikers - they tend to approach from behind without notice or making a sound so you need to be on the lookout.  We only went about 1-1/2 miles before turning back but it was a lovely walk."
Animas River Trail,4.5,Great trail for pushing a stroller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We walked along this paved trail twice during our visit. It is great for strollers and young children to watch the river. There are multiple picnic locations and broader park spots for children to play along the way.  All visitors to Durango do a lot of walking and this is a good way to accommodate young children at the same time.  It is a very popular trail and extends far north of Downtown.  It is free - the hardest part is finding a parking spot.
Animas River Trail,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful walking trail that follows the Animas River.  Wide trail that has quite a bit of traffic.  Walkers, runners, dogs, and bikes.  WATCH for the bikers.  They come flying around corners or from behind you so be aware.  Multiple bridges you can cross and also tunnels that go under the road above."
Animas River Trail,4.5,River Path / Paved Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A beautifully picturesque walking trail that follows the Animas River for a few miles. The path is paved and flat, which makes it very easy to travel upon. The path is fairly wide as well, which is helpful with so many people using it. We see multiple walkers, runners, and even bicyclists. As other reviewers pointed out, watch out for the bikers since they tend to appear suddenly and unexpectedly."
Animas River Trail,4.5,Perfect for exploring Durango,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We brought our bikes along on our vacation and rode 15 miles along this pretty river trail.  We were able to access it right behind our hotel, the Doubletree.   Trail was paved and there’s plenty to see, neighborhoods, including a tiny house neighborhood, commercial buildings (mostly the back of them), scenic river with rafters, mountain views and many parks. Time it right, and you might see the Durango Silverton train.  There’s a foot bridge across the river that accesses another trail.   We felt this was a great way to explore Durango without fighting traffic and looking for a coveted parking spot."
Riverside Walk,4.5,Nice Walk in Scenic Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a lovely, easy walk along the river at the north end of the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive.  It is very nice, offers great views of the scenery along the river, and is basically flat and easy to do.  Some parts may be muddy or slippery when it is wet or icy but  although we saw people with hiking boots, I can't image that is necessary for the riverwalk and we certainly didn't have any, even though there were some muddy or icy parts, and a little snow on the ground.  We were there in late December 2021 and it was chilly but not particularly cold during the day. At its end, this leads to the Narrows area, which involves a more strenuous and adventurous walk through the river narrows, in the river itself.  That looked fun and we intend to try it but we had to throw this trip together at the last minute so were not prepared to do anything like that, and had no time to, either."
Riverside Walk,4.5,Popular but delightful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is short, easy and beautiful. What this means is you should get here early as it’s going to become pretty crowded as more buses arrive. This is especially true when the Narrows, from the end if the trail are open. Still, I have nothing but good to say about the walk."
Riverside Walk,4.5,Beautiful Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a must do if you are in Zion.  The fall colors were amazing and the walk is fairly easy and most of it paved (although parts of it you can walk the river edge, which is less crowded and more like hiking).  When you get on the shuttle at the visitor center, take it all the way to the end and start your Zion adventure here.  Everyone is required to get off here, as it is the last stop, making it easier to get a seat on the shuttle heading back to the other stops."
Riverside Walk,4.5,walk along the Virgin river,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is not a difficult one, it said it is paved, it takes about 1.5 hour for the round trip. if you want to to go to Narrows, then you must walk this trail, as the end of the trail is the beginning of the trail of the Narrows. For the day that we went, the river water level may be higher than safety level, so the Narrows is closed, not allowed people to go to that trail. You have to check the condition for the Narrows in visitor center before hike. As the riverside walk is along the Virgin river, people will go into the river at some point, they may play in the water, but of course you have to take your responsibility for your safety. If you want to walk this trail, you have to get off at the last bus stop (#9) of the shuttle."
Riverside Walk,4.5,Beautiful But Too Crowded,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful Trail but there were so many people on it that it lost a lot of it's beauty.  We did not go all the way to the Narrows as we were advised by a ranger to not get into the water because of the dangerous algae, but many people were coming back obviously wet.  They discovered it when a dog drank from the water and died."
Riverside Walk,4.5,Scenic traffic free riverside walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We walked to the monastery from town (40 mins) then along the dusty road to Te Sharra restaurant (20 mins). Although a limited menu a lovely riverside location. Then we discovered  a 2 km pathed walk along the far side of the river back to Peja. Scenic walk. You can detour back down into the town at various points. It might be hard to find the start if coming from town but walk along the southern side riverside walk and when it ends head up the hill and you should find the track. Local kids on bikes helped us out.
Riverside Walk,4.5,NOTHING like it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I could not stop smiling and taking pictures. This was the most unique and fun hike ever!
Riverside Walk,4.5,Take some forays off of the pavement ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Busier path, but totally worth it. There were lots of people using the path just to walk to the narrows for the in-river walk, even though an algae bloom suggests they shouldn't be doing that this year. So it can be extra busy. Take the time to get off the paved path and into the sand by the river. It will slow you down, get you some better views, and make the trip more memorable."
Riverside Walk,4.5,Wonderful walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is your main starting point if you are going to Hike The Narrows on the bottom up route.  Tips are to start early, especially if you plan to keep walking into The Narrows.  the Riverside Walk is a lovely stroll.  Starting at The Temple of Sinawava, the beauty of the mountains is something to behold.  We took some time to marvel at the grandeur of these mountains which show their awe inspiring boldness in a way that is difficult to understand from photographs. Being in their presence is a unique and special experience."
Riverside Walk,4.5,Crowded - even early,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a beautiful path to walk but even early prepared to be there with 100’s of people on a mission for the narrows. It would be excellent but for the crowds. Don’t plan on getting a picture at the start of the narrows that looks like the advertising- it’s a giant column of people headed up the river.
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,Too small for all of the water activities ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented a two person kayak for two hours which was more than enough time to traverse the very small water area that you're allowed to navigate. It was very busy - kayaks, paddle boards, yachts, motor boats - to the degree that it wasn't very peaceful. Constantly felt like you had to navigate around another paddler or avoid being rammed by a vessel. "
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,Great Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lots of fun things to do here, we hiked a lot of the paved trails and saw fun art and interesting science installments along the way.  Ice skating rink was open when we went and it looked fun, tho we did not partake.  The $6 entrance fee is definitely put to good use as its very well maintained here."
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,"Lovely, large, well maintained park",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love this park. We bought a lifetime pass. There are a variety of walking paths, a play ground, kayak, canoe, paddler board rentals. Just a very pleasant place to spend an hour and afternoon or a day."
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,Nice place for a morning walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family and I wanted to take a walk after breakfast before leaving Annapolis to drive to our next destination so we went to Quiet Waters Park. Lots of walking trails, most of them shaded by mature trees, and not very busy when we were there. Next time we'll rent kayaks and do some paddling."
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,Short walk with our Yorkie,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Was a nice park to spend a couple hours. Walked our dog, saw some birds and nice people. Employee at visitor center out with their Box Turtle and had nice conversation. Nice level paths for strollers and easy walking. Gardens look like the will be great when flowers bloom."
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,The Quiet Waters Art Gallery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beside biking, ice skating and bird watching in a beautiful setting, Quiet Waters also has a lovely two-story Art Gallery.  Exhibitions are by carefully sected local guilds and individuals, and are quite impressive.  Shows generally run for 6 weeks, and include a reception on the first Sunday afternoon of the show.  Most of the work is available for sale.  A group of us who attended a reception in January were very impressed with the work and enjoyed speaking with the artists.  I believe the next reception will be on March 30."
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,Slice of heaven on the South River,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Annapolis has a great deal of history, it's true; but there are so many other experiences that should not be missed.  One that is high on my list is to spend 2 to 3 hours at Quiet Waters.  340 acres of mixed terrain, 4.5 miles of paved trails, additional 5 miles of unpaved trails, kayak, bicycle and canoe rentals and wild life.  Don't miss the deer, fox, raccoon, egrets, herons, osprey, turtles, opossums, squirrels and the ever present sea gulls.  A delight for the senses."
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,Overhyped & Overpriced,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Like many things in Annapolis, this place is overhyped and overpriced. It's not actually bad, just meh.  Sure, there are paved trails, some picnic areas, water and the like.  Okay, so what?  I can find that pretty much anywhere, usually for free.  The trails are nothing special.  The water is just a brownish creek/river thing.  The scenery is run of the mill woods.  Yeah, I did see some deer, but again, so what?  I can see those pretty much any night driving down the freeway.  So if you want to pay for the utterly mundane, then have at it!"
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,Beautiful day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,First time to this park but won't be the last. Very pretty setting close to all that Annapolis has to offer. Great dog areas for both on and off leash. The visitors center with fountains and bridge are beautiful. 
Quiet Waters Park,4.5,Green gem in Annapolis,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice paved trails through woods and around fields, some with water views. You'll find people walking and running with and without dogs. Also fine for biking. In the summer months- kayaking and boating, in the winter- ice skating. There is a visitor's center with art exhibits and cafe. There are pavilions to rent or a nice party room. Playgrounds for kids and a fenced dog park- one area for large dogs and one for small."
Loop Road,4.5,This was a mistake,1.0 of 5 bubbles,We took this road based on reviews and it was horrible.
Loop Road,4.5,"Everything, all at once",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are countless stops and hikes you can do to take in the Everglades.   But, if you want the best of everything in one dose, then drive the loop road that runs from near Shark Valley back to Monument Lake.    We drove from the Shark Valley end, and the first several miles are paved before it turns into an easy gravel road.   There are tons of ponds, wetlands and forest where you will see so much wildlife.  All the birds of the Everglades, frogs, lizards, snakes, and so many gators. Gator,s swimming, gators sunning here and there, gator, eyes staring at you from the water, and lots of road gators - right beside the road!  You can see tons right from your car, but you will notice even more if you stop and get out of the few of the more scenic nooks along the way. There aren’t a lot of pullouts, but people were stopping on the side of the road whenever there was something to see.  Everglades in a nutshell, give it a try."
Loop Road,4.5,An absolute must do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although the Shark Valley tram tour was really neat too, this was my favorite thing we did in the Everglades area."
Loop Road,4.5,Free Florida Safari,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great way to explore true Florida without any restrictions. Need to have a off road 4x4 car. We took this trip from Fort Myers to Key West and loop road will add extra 45minutes to your total time. It’s very bumpy but well worth it. You will experience nature in they best version all the Florida species in one spot. Watch for alligators, crocodiles, panthers they like to lay down on the road. "
Loop Road,4.5,Excellent drive.  Road in better shape than expected.  NP Passport/Junior Ranger activities.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Reading the reviews on the Loop Road of Big Cypress National Preserve, we were a bit concerned if our rental car could handle it.  When we arrived, we found the road to be in much better condition than we ever expected.  It was paved in areas and had plenty of gravel in the others.  We had absolutely no issues.  The Loop Road was a slice of Old Florida.  It is scenic as anything and you will have plenty of opportunities to take photos of animals and nature.  For those of you collecting National Park Passport Stamps or Junior Ranger Badges, Big Cypress has both.  In fact. the Everglades Junior Ranger book covers both parks so you only need to complete it once and you get two badges as long as you go to both parks' visitor centers."
Loop Road,4.5,Loop Road,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loop Road for bird watchers & wildlife. This quiet dirt byway is a 24 mile detour off Tamiami Trail. It's mostly cypress swamp, with lots of birds, hawks, wild hogs, egrets, and alligators."
Loop Road,4.5,Great interaction with no price,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The best way to see the habitat  LIVE with no crowds. A long slow drive we found many, many alligators and other birds enjoying the sun and waterways. A must if you can spend a few hours."
Loop Road,4.5,Take your time...,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The loop road goes through various habitats of the Everglades.  Take your time to fully take in the details, look for wildlife, and appreciate the natural beauty.  My favorite spot is Sweetwater Strand as there are usually several herons and egrets in the area.  It's a great area for photos."
Loop Road,4.5,Take time and enjoy the everglades,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a great relaxing drive; I entered from the Monroe Station west end. The first 16 miles are gravel road and while rough at times it is very drivable. I was on a Harley trike and had no trouble however it was dusty when someone from the other side came by at a rather fast pace. Be sure and stop at the small bridge areas and get out and stand by the road, you will see some alligators and several birds. We saw an owl dive down to try and get a squirrel. You will also see alligators sunning along the side of the road. This is a free way to see alligators in a natural setting. Take time and enjoy the everglades."
Loop Road,4.5,Great animal spotting,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stopping at the pullouts was definitely worthwhile. While watching a heron, my husband said, ""someone is watching you"". I looked into the water and saw only shadows from the large trees around the pond. Then I noticed two eyes and a nose just above the water line. A quintessential Florida experience. Also saw lots of other birds and a few other alligators as well as gorgeous flora. It is a great loop but you do have to stop and get out of the car,"
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Underwhelming Hike and Falls,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Dukes Creek is a pretty easy 2 mile roundtrip hike. There are $4 pay envelopes there, which require exact change. It is one of those pay systems that I am almost certain you could get away with skipping on if you do not have exact change, FYI. Anywho, this is an unspectacular hike composed almost entirely of long and gradual switchbacks. The hike itself is very unimpressive with no notable scenery on the way. The waterfall is more impressive, but is not as great as people say. When you get down there, there is a very short waterfall that follows the river and a tall, but not very voluminous, fall that joins with the river. I did Anna Ruby and I thought that was significantly better for both the hike and the falls. I didn't do Raven Cliff, but would wager that one was more impressive too. It's not terrible, but it's not your best area waterfall option. I think this one is a victim of overhype."
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,"Another beautiful waterfall in Helen, Ga",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This waterfall was a bit more of a hike than Anna Ruby falls.  It was a little over a mile downhill to get to the falls and then uphill on the way back.  Again, we felt very comfortable with social distancing from others and the view was well worth the hike.  "
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,It is an absolutely beautiful 1-mile hike down to the falls where were we played in the water.  Paths are mostly gravel for easy travel.  Saw a few people fly fishing in streams.  There is a $4.00 parking fee and no change available- so carry the correct $$$ or you may lose your big bills :)... which would support the park... it's not a hard hike for the family.  
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Our favorite of three waterfalls in the area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"These waterfalls were incredible.  We visited three different waterfalls in the area (Anna Ruby Falls and Raven Cliffs Falls were the others).  Although all three were great, Dukes Creek Falls were our favorite. The area had just recently received rain associated with Hurricane Delta so they were rushing.  Visiting the falls made me feel like I had gone on an exotic trip to the rainforest.  The trail was perfectly maintained.  The observation decks were very nice and provided a lovely view of the multiple waterfalls that make up Dukes Creek Falls.  "
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Let’s Hike to the waterfall!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of our favorite movies is “couples retreat”. During this trip my wife kept telling me she just wants “to hike to the waterfall” (reoccurring in the movie) So we found a waterfall to hike to it is 1.1 mile one-way so a little over 2 mile round-trip and although it does walk up and down the side of a hill to get to the bottom to see the waterfall is very pleasant easy hike back and forth with a gradual descent. There are some steps but I would recommend anyone. All ages were on the hike and everyone made it fine,  it’s a beautiful waterfall once you get to the end and you definitely need to experience it!"
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Great family activity,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were staying at a vacation rental at Lake Lanier and decided to take a break from the lake. We had 3 generations, grandma mid 70’s, two moms, and 5 preteens. It was an easy switchback hike down to the base of the falls, a couple of sets of stairs and graveled the balance. A stroller or wheelchair would not be suitable. All along the trail you can hear the roar of the falls but they are obscured by the trees. But what a sight when you reach the viewing platform at the end!  Of course our kids hopped the railing and joined several other young people swimming in the pools and under the falls. I’m not saying you should do this, but you wouldn’t be the first to do so!  It was pretty enticing!  Hike back was of course all uphill, but if this 74 yr old grandma with a pacemaker can do it, most people should be able to as well. Enjoy your hike!"
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Nice Large Waterfall - Easy Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was our first waterfall hike in the area and it was a really good one.  It is a short drive northwest of Helen GA.  The hike is 1.1 miles down to the base of the Falls.  Parking is $4 per car on an honor system.  Well worth it as the area is well maintained.  There are restrooms and picnic tables with a nice view just off the parking lot.  The water fall is large and there are several nice viewing platforms.  Some people were having fun wading in the water.  It was really nice.
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Long Hike & Great Stream to Play in,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Longer hike then it would seem. Not for children under 7 unless you want to carry them back. You can't swim in waterfall but take the time to visit the stream at the 1st trail detour. Take a right about 0.3 mile into hike. You can play in the stream there. Very cool and refreshing water.
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Honeymoon hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is our second time in Helen, this time was for a mini honeymoon. This review is coming to you from 47 year olds, he works in HVAC, and is constantly in the summer sun and heat. I work for a Ford Dealership doing finance, so I am in AC all day. I am also overweight and a smoker. Neither of us are “hikers”. This was the first. And IT WAS SOOOOOO WORTH IT!!!!!!  We went in the morning about 930am...it was 82° when we got in the parking lot. Fee is $4 for day use permit. The trail is well maintained except down further where it can be a little rough.  The falls are amazing but probably not as fast as they could be since there hasn’t been any rain. Nice observation decks, and the cool breeze created by the falls was a welcomed thing. I personally had a bit of a workout on the way back up. I had to stop 5 times and catch my breath. It doesn’t seem that steep going down but you notice it come back up. The trail winds back and forth, and after the last set of steps there are no more benches until the end. Glad we did the hike and I think we’ll do Anna Ruby next. Take your time. It’s not a marathon. This hike made me realize that I’d like to go on more and see the beauty that’s behind the tree lines on the side of the highway!!!  "
Dukes Creek Falls Trail,4.5,Peaceful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"These falls are amazing and peaceful, we walked the 2.2 miles round trip with 4 teenagers, it was so worth it. The trail is well kept and a nice walk, it does get a little rough in areas. The falls are beautiful and amazing, all 4 teenagers were in awe! Definitely recommend for families! "
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,Stunning Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As you hike along the ridge, you are treated to the greenest green as you look down into a lush valley and on the other side, the bluest blue as you look out at the ocean. At one point, we even saw whales! We got to the parking lot at 8:15 on a Sunday morning and got one of the last available spots. There is an adjacent parking area on private property that sometimes allows cars to park there for a fee. On this particular weekend,  the Boy Scouts were given the opportunity to fundraise by charging people $10 to park on the lot owned by Camp Maluhia. There are porta-potties in the main parking area. Many people have commented on how slippery the trail is - even on a dry day. This is true. In many areas, the trail consists of hard-packed mud similar to a slick clay. One really should have shoes with good tread. I saw people fall and I fell once myself even though I had good sturdy hiking shoes and a walking stick! My partner and I are fit individuals although we fall into an older age bracket. We did the hike in 3 hours, stopping frequently to take photos and we had a leisurely snack at the top while we enjoyed the 360 degree view. This hike is truly worthwhile especially on a sunny day!"
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,You don't even have to go to the top to have incredible views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is a must-do!  After walking for roughly one mile, the trail canopy begins to open and you experience a view that has a little bit of everything.  The hike can become a bit challenging, especially if it is raining, after about 1.5 miles, but even going partway up the trail is worth-while experience.  Pro-tips: Go early (!!) and bring a friend to hold the portapotty door open should you dare to use it (the only unpleasant thing about this hike)."
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,Early Morning Workout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The fence is opened at 7:00 am for the hikers to drive up to the upper parking lot with portable restrooms.
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,"Beautiful Ridge Views, Steep Climb",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Limited parking but there is overflow parking. Initial hike is long and steep. Stop often to catch your breath as needed. Bring water. Views are terrific. As you get higher, the temperature cools down a bit. Best to go early in the day, especially during summer."
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,Well worth it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an absolutely gorgeous trail.  We went right when it opened.  There are beautiful views of the ocean from afar, rolling hills, waterfalls, and cliffs.  It is a good five miles round trip are a bit narrow with some steep drops so I wouldn't recommend it for young kids.  Th change in scenery throughout the trail is breathtaking, and you literally move from what looks like a miniature redwood forrest to a breathtaking landscape of green rolling hills and waterfalls.  It gets very muddy towards to top, especially if it has rained recently, so I would recommend bringing a separate pair of shoes to hike in."
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,Good exercise with spectacular views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We arrived in the morning - which I recommend both to secure a parking spot as well as to start before it gets too hot. 
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,Beautiful trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail is fairly wide for most of the route and conditions are not too challenging. The ascent and distance is somewhat substantial, 12,000 steps, 6.7Km, 1500 vertical feet in total. Takes about 1 hour each way. Some very majestic and beautiful views. Visibility and precipitation varies on the day & time."
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,Rainy but spectacular view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"On the day we went there were a couple of rainy showers, couple of people turned back due to rain but our group stayed huddled under trees until the rain lightened up after about 15 minutes. Even on a somewhat foggy and overcast day, the view at the viewpoint was spectacular. Steep strenuous start, and after than moderate uphill, however our group turned back after the viewpoint and didn't get to the top. It was amazing to be at the top of the west maui mountains. As others noted, limited parking at the top parking lot, need to arrive before 9am on a Sunday to secure parking. Looked like there was an overflow dirt lot further down, which may add 40 mins to the initial uphill trek. Grazing cows at the beginning (fenced). 2 portable toilets at parking lot (no tissue)."
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,Hard work. Worth the effort.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked this trail in June with my husband. The views along the whole trail were spectacular and there is a variety of different micro ecosystems as you go along so the view is always changing. The trail was dry when we went, maybe it was the season or maybe it was luck. There are stairs and wood boards along some parts of the path presumably to get people through the worst of the mud. "
Waiheʻe Ridge Trail,4.5,Best hike on Maui!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Excellent hike with amazing views. 4.5 miles out and back hike, with MANY stops for photos. About 1600 ft of elevation gain. We arrived at 10 am on a day with PERFECT weather, and were able to get a parking spot, as many hikers were returning from early morning hikes. We are a 70 yo active couple, and brought hiking poles, which many were eyeing with envy!"
Bright Angel Point,5.0,Best view from the lodge area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Easy and fairly short hike from the lodge. Kid friendly. Great views from the North Rim. Easy to go out at different times during the day as the sun and clouds will change the view.
Bright Angel Point,5.0,Great Viewpoint,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great viewpoint. We were here at sunset and sunrise, since it's so easy to get to if you are staying at the Lodge. Despite that proximity, it's not very crowded (which amazes me - but I guess people like to sleep in on vacation even at one of the great wonders of hte world). There are some large rocks you can safely climb up for an even more remote feeling."
Bright Angel Point,5.0,Freaky but the view is breathtaking!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you have issues with heights then skip this! I’m normally ok with heights but nearly had a panic attack after walking across a narrow part of the trail with deep, steep canyon drops on both sides. Do not let your kids run ahead on this one or climb the rocks. The drops are miles deep. I was still shaking after I got off the trail. I did go to the end with a couple who had me walk with them."
Bright Angel Point,5.0,WOW!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you do one thing at North Rim, hiking out to Bright Angel Point and enjoying the views for as long as you can should be that thing. Absolutely amazing! One thing to note...while the trail is paved, it is pretty steep out and back."
Bright Angel Point,5.0,Greart View of the Grand Canyon from a Nice Spot,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This view point is great from all perspective. 1st it has a great view of the Grand canyon itself. There are coffee and snack shop nearby. The washrooms are good. There is a small museum (free!).  I think, people should spend some extra time in this place.."
Bright Angel Point,5.0,Definitely worth the effort to see the views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We checked out the lodge and then walked out to see the views at the end. It does go downhill mostly and with the elevation you get to huffing and puffing a bit. We just took our time and stopped to catch our breath a bit in the shady areas. That’s what many people were doing. It’s does go up & down along the way and it’s a fairly short walk. It’s definitely worth the views along the way and at the end.
Bright Angel Point,5.0,CONFUSION!  Read these reviews with care -- most are wrong!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bright Angel Point is located on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  Many (most) reviewers here are confusing it with the Bright Angel trailhead located on the South Rim.  As you read the reviews, keep that in mind.  These are two very different locations.  The North Rim is closed during winter."
Bright Angel Point,5.0,A walk that is like no other!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Take a bottle of water, a camera, be prepared to be out of breadth because of the high altitude and don't rush and enjoy each and every view you see walking to Bright Angel Point. The path is easy to walk on with just a few inclines, so okay for most people."
Bright Angel Point,5.0,Most beautiful Trail head evah!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ah, the majestic start of our descent down into the mouth of the Grand Canyon... It is a lovely area even if just passing by, but was so poignant to my family and I as we began our hike and eventual camping experience we trained for, inside of the canyon.  A must see if at all possible, even if on a mule, or helicopter.  "
Bright Angel Point,5.0,Amazing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing!  We love the northern rim and think its better side of grand canyon and this place only exemplifies this!  Come here you wont be disappointed!
SculptureWalk,4.5,Very interesting ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Arc of Dreams looks great, even in the daytime. We liked the theme of it and the meaning behind it: there is a gap at the top of the arch that represents the leap of faith that you take when you follow your dreams. We drive through the city so that we could see many of the other sculptures. They were all interesting and enhanced our trip through Sioux Falls. "
SculptureWalk,4.5,can have a leisure walk there,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"the Arc of Dream seems to be the landmark of the city (Sioux Falls), there is an indoor space showing the information about this Arc, it's just an structure for you to see it on the ground, you can't walk on it. There is light shinning on it at night. You can walk along the river, it's a short one, and there are some sculpture in that area, too."
SculptureWalk,4.5,Very cool sculptures,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I absolutely loved seeing all of the sculptures throughout my walks. Whoever organized this deserves a huge round of applause. It was cold and windy the days I was there but the variety of sculptures had me stopping to enjoy and to photograph. It really helped make my visit extra special. I loved Sioux Falls (first time there, and to South Dakota) and the people. Wonderful job to the city and artists!"
SculptureWalk,4.5,Neat,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Didn't get to see the Arc at night, sadly, but was still neat during the day. We enjoyed looking at all the sculptures on both sides of the street downtown as well. I only took a few pictures but there are dozens! Easy walk from Falls Park so you don't have to do meter parking."
SculptureWalk,4.5,Very interesting,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Enjoyed looking at many of the statues which are on the main 'restaurant' row in downtown Sioux Falls.  We were trying to find a place to eat while still taking a number of cool pictures of the sculptures.  Reminds me a lot of downtown main street in Grand  Rapids, Michigan - with all the sculptures and artwork.  Still, this is a rather safe city and we had a great time looking at the art."
SculptureWalk,4.5,Not worth the time - go to Falls Park instead which is fabulous,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"We planned to stop and even stay in town, giving the hype on all the things to do...There was so much construction going on that walking around town to see the sculptures was not possible or nice to do;  the Arc of Dreams monument is not much to see during the day.  Better to go to Falls Park which is worth your time."
SculptureWalk,4.5,Inspiration in an Unexpected Place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Arc of Dreams dominates the Sioux Falls skyline and spent a morning walking around wondering what it was. It’s a new addition to the city that inspires big bold dreams and the gap in the sculpture symbolizes the leap of faith needed to make it happen. It’s lit up by night and looks even prettier. Lots of plaques with inspirational quotes to look at too. Unexpected in this small city but a testament to smart planning and investment in art. 
SculptureWalk,4.5,Pleasing Downtown Surprises!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice Surprise Indeed! My wife and I were passing through Sioux Falls and we were looking for a place to eat downtown. The surprise... the Downtown Sioux Falls Sculpture Walk! After having lunch, we decided to spend some time walking around downtown before the 4hr+ drive back to Grand Forks. If your plan is to blow by each sculpture without a chance to appreciate them, then this is not for you. If you have some time to really take a look at each sculpture and truly try to appreciate what the artist was trying to do, I think you’d really enjoy the Sculpture Walk. Since our time was limited, we were unable to see all the sculptures. This is a good reason for us to come back to Sioux Falls. I know we missed out on many other works of art. With lots of great places to eat downtown, and sculptures scattered around downtown as well, it was time well spent for us! Merci Beaucoup! (3/21)"
SculptureWalk,4.5,Definitely Worth a View,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This unexpected piece of art is the highlight of the downtown sculpture walk. The Arc of Dreams transcends a downtown walking bridge over the river. It is easily accessible with nearby parking and a short walk to photographic views. It is close to other sculptures and downtown eateries. Worth a look when you are in or passing through Sioux Falls.
SculptureWalk,4.5,Viewing the SculptureWalk & Arc of Dreams Monument,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Good trip. We arrived at approximately 4:15 pm and made our way towards the entrance of the monument. There was a bridge overlooking the water, as well as several plaques at the end of the monument, highlighting the designers who were the masterminds behind the finished product. There was also a trail that one could take that brought them alongside the water. "
Centennial Trail,4.5,Tale of 2 Trails,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail stretches from Northwest Spokane to the east end of Lake Coeur d Alene.  It's amazing how much better the trail is once you cross the border into Idaho.  On the Washington side the trail is very, very rough in stretches, you WILL encounter multiple homeless people, and on a trip yesterday not a single water fountain was working (too much vandalism apparently), and the bathrooms are either locked or disgusting. It's a shame to watch such a gem decay as local government does nothing. Couldn't they divert at least some of the funds maintaining the state's largest homeless camp to repair something thousands of taxpayers use each week?  Cross the border into Idaho and it's like entering another world. Clean, well maintained, water fountains work, bathrooms are clean and unlocked, signage is good, no homeless people camping around the trail, great views by the lake, and just simply feels safer. I ride the trail frequently but as you might guess usually in Idaho."
Centennial Trail,4.5,Spokane: A River and a Trail Runs Thru It,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Whether you are just visiting, new to the area or long-time resident, the Centennial Trail is a unique way to discover Spokane. It winds along the scenic Spokane River from Nine Mile Falls thru the heart of downtown Spokane out to the Spokane Valley and beyond.Read about the trail in detail at the official website: www.spokanecentennialtrail.org -- regrettably I am not a member of the ?Friends of the Centennial Trail? Still I encourage you to pick a spot to start exploring and be sure to pack a picnic lunch. Also, bear in mind these words of wisdom:-- BRING WATER. Whether you are walking or riding there are some long hot dry stretches where you will need it. -- BATHROOM BREAKS. Bathrooms can be some distance apart. Be sure to take advantage of the facilities when available. Please don?t pollute. -- BE COURTEOUS. Joggers, walkers, bicyclist and even skaters use the trail. If you are walking or jogging and see and/or hear a bicycle or skater approaching, move to the right. If you are bicycling or skating, stay on the trail and warn pedestrians before passing them and then ride single file. In any case, always use caution when approaching intersections, rounding corners and traversing hills. -- SECURE YOUR VALUABLES. If you park you car near the trail, be sure to lock it and don't leave anything of value in sight. Break-ins, although infrequent, do happen. -- NEVER TRAVEL ALONE. Due to some unfortunate incidents in 2003, One woman was grabbed and there were reports of some flashers, it may not be safe to travel on the trail alone. If you have a cell phone, bring it. If needed, you can dial 911 to aid other trail users. For the more adventurous, the Centennial Trail continues into North Idaho another 24 miles! Following the Spokane River through the city of Post Falls, continuing along I-90 and through downtown Coeur d'Alene; the trail ends along the shores of beautiful Lake Coeur d'Alene."
Centennial Trail,4.5,Almost got mugged there,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Walking through the park at dusk, three guys fanned out in front of us across the trail. I could see a baseball sticking out below one of their jackets."
Centennial Trail,4.5,It's long enough to be a vacation on its own,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a 37-mile trail--it's actually just the western, more urban end of a nearly uninterrupted trail complex stretching more than 100 miles across Idaho. It's actually become a vacation destination in its own right, with lodgings and campgrounds along the route. For my money, this is the most unsung great attraction in the area, providing an often-gorgeous, winding bike route along the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene Rivers well into the Rockies. "
Centennial Trail,4.5,Great ride on Centennial Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Husband and I were looking for something to spend the morning doing and decided a bike ride would be fun.  Spokane has a trail system that goes by the hotel we were staying at-so thought we would ride that for a ways.  We hadn't brought our bikes, so rented from Spoke and Sport on North division.  It is just a couple of blocks away from the trail system and they let you park your car there for the duration of your rental, so is very convenient.  Very reasonable rental costs and the bikes worked well.  We took the trail heading east (towards Idaho).  We did not have a map so were hoping it would be marked well enough for us to follow. Luckily, it was! The trail is a combo of dedicated pathway and some onroad bits.  When riding on the road the bike path is well marked and generous.  no issues with traffic.  It is a relatively flat ride sometimes along the Spokand river and also travelling thru some residential areas.  Lots of areas to stop for bathroom breaks and places to hop into the river if you so desire!  We went during a weekday and the pathways were not too busy but I can imagine that on the weekends some parts of the system would be very congested!    All in all it was a great way to spend a few hours on a beautiful day!"
Centennial Trail,4.5,Very scenic. Nice trail away from traffic.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I only rode part of the trail from Spokane downriver to 9-Mile Dam. It was about 15 miles one-way. The entire trail goes all the way to the Idaho border I understand.
Centennial Trail,4.5,Fun place to visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Warm summer day. Lots of people out and it just felt good. Close walk to hotel. Plenty of children bathing in fountain. 
Centennial Trail,4.5,Very nice and affordable experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an experience that you can’t lose in Spokane. Very easy to access in the middle of the downtown and walking distance from the Convention Center. The price is very reasonable ($8 adults). The ride takes around 15 to 20 minutes.
Centennial Trail,4.5,Centennial Trail from Post Falls towards Spokane,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took a nice 30 mile bike ride out and back from Post Falls towards Spokane, while it was along the river it was also adjacent to the freeway.  Apparently, the better section is East of Spokane or along Lake Coeur d'Alene"
Centennial Trail,4.5,Must for any trip to Downtown Spokane,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail is part of the downtown area and offers a great view of the river, city and park. Other than the many people driving around in Lime Scooter rentals that you must avoid, this is a great way to get exercise and scenery while visiting Spokane. "
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,Mother Nature in Colorado at its best..,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A must see if you are in Aspen area.. about 20 minutes drive from Aspen or Snow Mass.  Make sure it is open before you go.. Need reservation during day time. If you enter the park after 6 p.m. : then no need for reservation.. In a summer afternoon low sun and low traffic after 6 p.m. is a plus.. There are a few over night camp grounds for avid campers and nature lovers..  you will not be disappointed..
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,G O >> L A T E,4.0 of 5 bubbles,TIP: Avoid the Crowds. That’s what everyone wants. You have the perfect solo photograph. The trail to yourself. A parking spot. How do you get that in the Spring or Summer? You get the last reserved appointment pairing of the day  and arrive 30-40 minutes early. The previous afternoon groups are leaving and your ‘time slot’ hasn’t lined up at the gate yet. Find that opening my friend! The park service will let you in early during that last grouping. It’s like have a Solo visit for 30 minutes. Well worth planning for.
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,Great scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a 1.9 mile easy loop trail up & around the river & lake by Maroon Bells. The view is staggeringly beautiful & I enjoyed the trail very much. It does get crowded & unless you get there very early, you'll have company,"
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,Hit it during “off hours.”,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice easy pretty flat loop to hike around the lake. We hiked in the evening and went back with wine and watched the sunset. Lots of fish in the lake, as well as Canadian Geese. Watch your step! Take bug spray! Can be overgrown in the very back of loop."
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,Beautiful Hike but Misleading Description of Trail,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous place but I felt that the description of the hike was inaccurate. Others agreed with me including a couple of the park staff. It is described as an easy hike. The trail along Maroon Lake is easy, but the Scenic Trail was not. Perhaps a much younger person would consider it easy, but the description should include the fact that the trail is almost completely covered with uneven rocks that vary significantly in height. It is also very narrow in areas. I used a stick but still found it to be challenging. A warning that persons with balance issues, joint issues or osteoporosis might want to avoid this trail would be of benefit to many!"
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,Stunning Hike!  Not to be missed!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the most stunning hikes in CO.  Just did this with our family. Kids ages 16/13/11/9.  Everyone loved it.  Hike is NOT hard.  An enjoyable walk through some of the most beautiful scenery in the area.  Everywhere you look there is a great view to be had. Not to be missed!
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,Don't miss this! Beautiful views of the river,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I've  been to Maroon Bells two previous times and only ever did the Crater Lake Trail.
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,Great afternoon hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went for an afternoon hike up to Maroon Lake.  The hike was relatively easy and took about two hours round trip (not pushing the pace).  Lots of opportunities to take pictures.  Nice spot to rest by the lake at the top of the trail.  Definitely would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice time in nature.  There is a fee to enter the National Forest, but well worth the price."
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,The most photographed place in Colorado,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose to drive here instead of taking the bus from Aspen Highlands to the Bells. It was an easy drive. While the Maroon Bells are touted as the most photographed place in Colorado, pictures simply don’t do the peaks justice. Maroon Lake Scenic Trail: This trail is one of the most heavily used trails in the Aspen area. Hikers and picnickers enjoy the wildflowers and views of the Maroon Bells and Pyramid Peak. A great family day hike with many photographic opportunities. The most popular viewpoint is from the shores of Maroon Lake, a pristine alpine lake enveloped by fields of wildflowers This easy one-mile round-trip trek starts at the parking area and follows the circumference of the lake. Would definitely recommend visiting Maroon Bells."
Maroon Lake Scenic Trail,5.0,Stunningly beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"From the parking area, or shuttle stop, it's a fairly short walk through a wildflower meadow to the lake and gorgeous views of the Maroon Bells peaks. The lake is a beautiful spot itself, but the view of the Marroon Bells from the lake is stunning! The walk to the end of the lake is mostly flat and wide and is not long. At the far end of the lake is a sweet spot with a little bridge, a bench, and a beaver lodge."
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,Easy hike with a hidden gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one hike that it might be better starting later in the morning, but a sunrise hike was still spectacular.  The trail is wide, easy and has beautiful scenery all around.  Don’t miss the arch – it’s a short spur trail to the right about halfway up the main trail.  You can see the arch from the spur…it looks like a cave.  The hike to the arch was the only difficult part of the whole hike.  We also climbed past the end of trail sign to see the box canyon from a little higher up.  This was trickier than the actual trail, but worth the effort."
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,Pleasant shady and easy flat trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We paired this trail with a more difficult hike completed in the morning.  Fay Canyon had plenty of parking spaces when we arrived in the afternoon.  It is very shady, and flat trail.  Round trip distance is about 2.5 miles.  No wonder it is family and dog friendly!"
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,The best trail in Sedona for the novice hiker.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is not too long and goes past some beautiful high canyon walls.  The trail has a slight elevation gain as you traverse the canyon, and most of it is very easy.  It is a popular trail but one I always recommend to the beginning hiker."
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,Nice Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were looking for a nice hiking trail that was not too long or difficult as my wife had hip replacement near five years ago.  This was the perfect hike.  2.6 miles up and back with mostly shade after you walk from the parking lot.  At the end of the trail before you turn around many hikers were climbing the cliff face.  We passed on that but still enjoyed the wonderful scenery and spotted some unique birds.  Easy trail and you can't get lost.
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,Very level/flat trail. Great for beginners!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great trail for beginners or those that want a flat trail with beautiful views. Fay Canyon is located on Boynton Pass Road, just a quick 10-15 mins from West Sedona. The drive up offers some nice views as well. "
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,Enjoyable Short  Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The trailhead  is well signed  & has a good sized parking lot.  The views along the route exceeded expectations.  The trail is well maintained & effortless to traverse.     Whoever maintains this trail deserves a trophy; we did not see a piece of trash which was wonderful.
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,Quick and Easy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a good quick and easy hike, although we did not go to the arch, we just went to the end of the Trail. We did this after we did the Doe Mountain hike as it si just down the road."
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,Do the climb at the end of the trailhead,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Took our two boys (9 & 12) on this trail as they had been complaining about all the “moderate” trails we had done the past few days and gave them an “easy” rated trail for a change. Was a nice walk with great views. Heavy crowds but easy to maneuver around and everyone was polite and let you pass. Once you get to the “tail end” sign we noticed some people climbing up the side of the rock so I decided to check it out. Totally worth the extra effort! I believe my wife and boys would have been fine but my wife passed on going up. There was a clear path to follow and it kept going. The climb was more than worth it for the amazing views but even if that’s not your thing the hike on the marked path was a good walk for the boys.
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,Hidden Rock Arch off the Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is very easy and not too long. A lot of people hike it. There is an unmarked side trail that is kind of hard to find. The side trail is difficult and very steep, but takes you to a natural rock arch. The arch is awe inspiring and there are good views from underneath it."
Fay Canyon Trail,4.5,"Great beginners trail, with some bonuses",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our first hike after getting into town, and it was a great introduction. "
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,Peace and beauty on the coast,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful place to hike. Small, so you cannot get lost, but many trails to see different aspects of the coast. The woods were foggy, moss strewn, and fragrant. The coast trail was on the bluff with sweeping views. We were treated to quite a show when the dolphins off shore rounded up a school of bait fish and the cormorants and pelicans arrived to partake of the feast. "
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,Lovely spot for Relaxing walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great property with trails along the bluffs overlooking crashing surf.  One sees many types of flora and fauna including pelicans, gulls, egrets and you might be luckier than us and even spot an otter.  Paths are smooth and wide and weren't crowded even close to sunset mid-week in mid-September.  Parking is on the street but we didn't have difficulty finding a spot.  "
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,Stroll or Hike....You Choose,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a wonderful preserve.  If you want a nice seaside stroll you can keep to the boardwalk near the ocean.  Sometimes it is windy.  It is always beautiful.  If you want a hike, take the seaside trail and then make your way up the hill into the woods.  It is vey magical there.  We have run into deer that last two times and there are other surprises too.  Stay on the trails as there is a lot of poison oak.  In the wet season some of the ravines are pretty wet so some good boots can come in handy.  The trails are not well marked, but you can find your way around easily enough from the views.  There is no way you could get truly lost, because you have Highway 1, the ocean, and two neighborhoods surrounding the preserve."
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,Spectacular Walks Along and Above the Pacific Ocean,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a must-do walk when visiting Cambria.  The Fiscalini Ranch has been dedicated to public use so it is a giant open area where walkers and hikers are free to roam.  The ocean path is the most popular, probably a couple of miles of absolutely beautiful coastline. You may see whales, seals, otters, pelicans, and more while on a walk here.  There are several trails on the ridge above the ocean path which are also worth visiting.  There are a couple of butterfly observation areas which sometimes attract Monarch butterflies (and sometimes not; it's hit and miss).  Don't miss the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve when visiting Cambria!  "
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,Hidden Trail Gem,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"After walking the Moonstone boardwalk, we continued on and found the trail leading to the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve.  It was worth the walk and enjoy the outdoors.  We followed a small stream on the way in and on the way out we climbed up over the ridge and walked along a trail high above the ocean.  It was a gorgeous view."
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,We found our super-bloom here!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We just got back from a trip to Cambria, where we visited Fiscalini, as we'd heard it was worth a trip. We were unprepared for the beauty of this place. There were gorgeous flowers in profusion. The juxtaposition of the blooms next to the ocean was incredible. We saw many people walking dogs here. Lucky dogs! There are wonderful oversized benches where you can relax (regular benches, too). People sit by the water, mesmerized by the waves, lost in quiet contemplation of the beauty around and in front of them. We would happily return to Cambria just to take another hike here."
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,FANTASTIC FIND!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What a find! We've been going to Cambria for several years and I don't know how we missed this.  BEAUTIFUL trails with whimsical benches. Can't wait to go back. You can meander along the cliff trail and return on the upper trail.....or save one for another day.  We brought a little snack and watched the waves.  Easy easy walk for any age.
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,Wonderful views and easy access,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great area for hiking with trails with something for all.  We were lucky in that one of the trailheads was the front yard of the house we were renting.  This took the hiker into the more wooded area and a little more challenging for older less experienced hikes.  There was also a sign to take a bell in case of bears that made a few in the group a little nervous.  However, lower near the beach there is parking and more level and easier paths to traverse.  Parking is on the north and south ocean ends of the preserve.  There are benchs through out the paths for small breaks or to take in the beauty of the area.    Weather was great, lots of sun.  Can't go wrong with this area for a little exercise and communing with nature.  Best part - no charge!"
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,Wonderful place to hike along the coastal bluffs.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Exceptionally beautiful place to hike, either along the seaward edge of the coastal bluffs or higher up on the hillside.  Worth staying in Cambria just to hike here.  Hikes are 2 miles or less, round trip, and are easy to moderate."
Fiscalini Ranch Preserve,5.0,Refreshing Walk Along the Bluff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lovely way to spend an hour scenery gazing on this spectacularly beautiful stretch of the California Coast. The Bluff walk is about a mile, with driftwood benches along the way for long pauses of ocean-watching. The walk is almost all on a wood boardwalk and is flat all the way, also accessible."
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,better combine with Navajo trail to hike with more fun,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is no toilet along the trail, so better go restroom before the hike. It takes 30-40 min to hike from the Sunrise view point to the ”Queen’s Victoria” hoodoo, But along the trail, you can see different hoodoos at different angles and height, also there are some arches for you to pass through, it makes the hike more interesting. There is a “I hike the hoodoos” benchmark for you to scan (using pencil) or take picture, if you collect 3 benchmark of “I hike the hoodoos”, then you can go to visitor center to get a prize (it’s a sticker at the time when we hiked, not sure if it will change to other gift later). After the the ”Queen’s Victoria” hoodoo, you can walk back to your staring point or you can go to the Navajo trail, we choose to go to the Navajo trail, then we can get another the ”I hike the hoodoos” benchmark, it’s about 30 min walk from the “Queen’s Victoria” hoodoo, so the trail we hiked is called the “Queen’s garden / Navajo combination loop”, the loop with end up at the Sunset point (as we start at Sunrise point) (but if you starts at sunset point, it will end up at sunrise point)."
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,Fantastic trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We combined the Queens Garden and the Navajo trail.  This way we did not have to turn around and hike same spot over.  But really it was beautiful, even that would have been amazing.  Queens garden trail is a gentle slope down the entire way.  Amazing, a must.  Beauty around every corner.  The sights were so amazing and different, that you were always in awe.  The temperatures were very hot, so we started at dawn.  Bring lots of water.  We beat the heat and the crowds.  We had good hiking shoes (but could prob do with good running shoes).  We started at Sunrise point, ended at sunset point.  Chose to do the switchbacks at the end.  Did them slowly, it was easy."
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,One of the Most Accessible Hikes down into Bryce Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Queen's Garden Trail is one of the best trails in the park.  It descends into the Bryce Canyon Amphitheater and there are wonderful views of rock formations (hoodoos).  It can be combined with the Navajo Trail for a longer more difficult hike.  It has less elevation change than Navajo Trail and is the easiest hike that goes down into the amphitheater.  My son and I explored Queen's Garden Trail on horseback with Canyon Trail Rides and that was a great way to explore the trail.  Along this trail we saw many trees that had been hit by lightning. Evidently Bryce Canyon is a very dangerous place to be in a thunderstorm.  However, there was a beauty even to the charred trees.  This place is really wonderful.  "
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,"Wonderful, pleasant hike with iconic scenery.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a lovely hike from the top at the scenic drive down to the base, and back up.  It takes one through stunning, iconic scenery and it connects to other trails like the Navajo Loop.  Like the others, one can reach this easily by riving up the main road through Bryce Canyon and parking in a nearby parking area.  However, it if gets crowded, one may need to park further away.  We did it in winter with snow and ice, but had no real hiking or snow boots and we did it fine."
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,Tough but fantastic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took this trail back in July during what was a warm day. The descent into the canyon is easy enough as you'd expect, despite being steep in places. There then follows the generally well signposted flat part in the canyon with stunning views all around. "
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,One of the best hikes I have ever experienced. Stunning!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous. Indescribable and really needs to be experienced. Make sure to have plenty of water. While the hike was not strenuous for my tribe, I saw it was tough on others. Good shoes with traction are recommended. The view is unbelievable. Truly beautiful."
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,Beautiful morning hike.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a beautiful trail with steep elevation changes depending on which was you hike this trail.  We started at Sunrise and I think that’s the harder direction coming out. It was beautiful and not long.  I’m glad we did it.
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,The Best Bryce Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail was recommended to us and it did not disappoint. The Queens Garden trail takes you down into the canyon and between all of the formations. We followed it around and came up through the Wall Street section and it was well worth the effort. The one thing we learned was that Bryce is 9000ft above sea level so catching your breath was a real thing. We just used an easy pace and took several breaks on the climb out of the canyon. DO IT you will not regret it!
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,May 2020 visit to Bryce Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved the hike, unfortunately many of the other trails are closed due to Covid so we couldn’t take advantage of the other awesome sites to see. Very glad we were able to do this one though. Easy enough hike for just about anyone to do"
Queen's Garden Trail,5.0,Great views and an amazing hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked up from Navajo.  I like the climb out Queens Garden to sunrise as I think it’s an easy way out bs Navajo.  The views are fantastic and there are some shady areas in the late day.  Bring water and a little patience if the trail is busy
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,Well managed medium size park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful park some shade. Circular walks  about 1/2 mile total. Views of river and special information show, no charge. A small museum shows a film and articles used by the conqistadors."
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,"Learn about the Conquistador, De Soto. ",3.0 of 5 bubbles,This Memorial was very informative. We learned much about the Spanish Conquistador and his party as they landed here and wandered around the South Eastern US. There is a film in the visitor's center a trail along the beach and a stockade with demonstrations. 
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,Nice day trip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice little park with nature trails and boardwalk. Visitor center was closed due to COVID regulations, but talked to a park ranger who was super nice and informative. The park is pet-friendly so we brought our dog, 70lb female boxer. We saw several other people with dogs, large and small and all were leashed and well behaved. We talked to several guys fishing and if you enjoy, everyone we saw caught a fish. Several spots to get into the water to cool off. Its peaceful and we sat on benches and watched all the boats come and go in the bay. "
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,A hidden gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A gem of a small park.  Nice informative movie about DeSoto and the expedition he led into La Florida.  There was also a very good interpretive program with lots of information and items to handle to get a sense of the time period.  The ranger was good demonstrating weapons and how DeSoto shaped history of this area.  He also explained you can’t view history through the lens of modern sensibilities. As an added bonus…it’s FREE.
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,"Eye-opening, amazing history",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s beyond incredible, the story of DeSoto and his arduous 4 year odyssey in the 1500s to find gold in the southern US after making landfall in today’s Sarasota.  As a hardened Spanish conquistador, he and his men were tough and ruthless, taking as slaves local Indians they encountered along their journey through southern states, with gold always eluding them.  Do not miss the excellent film in the Visitor Center which tells the story amazingly well.  Check out the gift shop; I picked up a neat pirate treasure map and replica Spanish coins for kids in my family.  Then take the walking trail along the inlet shoreline where DeSoto landed and imagine what it was like almost 500 years ago.  We spent in total about 2.5 hours here.  I knew about other early landings on America’s east coast but DeSoto’s history was totally new to me and was eye-opening.  Highly recommend a visit here when in Sarasota."
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,The starting point of an ill-fated expedition,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The ominous jumping-off point to an adventure of death, torture, greed, and tragedy. Small, compact but historically significant locale. The National Park Service building is spotless, has a very informative film (highlighting the serious dangers) , clean bathrooms, and an interesting little gift shop. There are some nice hiking trails. The entire place is uncrowded, well-cared for, has a nice breeze, is clean and with gorgeous scenery. Tip: Bring a picnic lunch and dine on a park bench overlooking the inlet. This is just a real gem."
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,See the cross,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Really tranquil some wildlife We saved a turtles life as we were leaving the park he tried to cross the street.  My husband carried him back into the woods.  I really did not want him to be flattened.  The park is right across from several neighborhoos.  The walk through the park was actually entertaining.  They kept introducing a few conquistadors and indians along the trail.  In the end you see this great cross.  It wasn't well kept at the time I think because the parks in Florida just started to open up. Still worth the trip.  Especially now a day's looking for things to entertain not envoling others.  
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,Interesting and pretty walking path but outdated displays,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Female Park ranger was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. She explained things well and answered all our questions. Park could use some updating and it’s in the works but takes time. Nice walking trail - leads into property owned by catholic hutch from what a resident told us which explains the large cross we saw. Beautiful path in national park along the waters edge."
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,"Beautiful viewpoints, interesting nature, and accessible trails",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of my favorite spots from my trip to Bradenton/Sarasota! This site offers beautiful viewpoints, interesting nature, and accessible trails. After making a short stop at the visitors center and watching the film about DeSoto’s expeditions, we walked through the shorter trails. I have to admit, the film made me wonder about why exactly the guy gets a memorial! As a photographer, I ultimately very much enjoyed the views and enjoyed the unique flora of the area. "
De Soto National Memorial,4.5,Great when no mosquitos.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Just a warning. It’s a great place but as of June is infested with mosquitos. There is even a sign warning of the high levels. We didn’t know this nor did we see the sign until after only 3 minutes there and we were being attacked like crazy. Having a son they is allergic we left as soon as possible. In 3 minutes I obtained 15 bites and that’s with spray on!
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,"Beach, ocean, surfers & Beautiful Homes",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The scenic road walkway is a delight. There are many benches Along the way to make a stop and enjoy the panoramic ocean view. Surfers are a joy to watch and you can head down to the beach if so inspired. We had a glorious and sunny shirt sleeve day that made it that much more enjoyable. Walk, relax, or get wet. This is a major part of what makes Carmel special."
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,Must do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was so good, we drove it twice! One way super scenic drive. Gorgeous homes overlooking the beach, lots of street parking if you wish to walk along the road or beach. The homes and views were truly stellar."
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,Enjoy coast & stunning homes at same time,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"On a sunny day— spectacular walk, no matter how far you go. I like a ling walk down to FLWright home & Butterfly House & Tor House/ Hawk Tower, all in same block. At any point, you can head diwn to beach"
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,Lovely walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Best walk ever.  Nice, level foot path (compact dirt/gravel) with full view of gorgeous ocean, calming sound of waves, lots of benches along the way to rest or ponder as needed.  Walker can walk beyond the walkway, on Scenic Rd itself, for a longer walk. Cars drive slowly. If weather is nice, the walk will fill your spirit! Of interest are also the beautiful homes along Scenic Dr.  I loved every minute and every step, and enjoyed resting on a bench after my walk to take it all in! "
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,Beautiful walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a beautiful walk.  We parked at the lot on the north end of the drive and started our walk on the beach walking south.  At the FLW house (as far as you can really go on the beach), we climbed the stairs and walked along the road past the Butterfly House to where the road curves.  We walked back on the street so we could see all the homes.  There are a number of places to climb down to the rocks as well as stairs for beach access.  There’s small restroom in the vicinity of the FLW house (on the road) that was surprisingly clean for a beach restroom.  Roundtrip it was about 3 miles."
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,Don't miss it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Everywhere you look, a postcard view. This is the best walking path on planet earth (in our humble opinion). Stroll, breathe deeply, sit on one of the many beautifully-placed benches, watch the ocean and dream. A refreshment to the spirit and an unforgettable glimpse of how the 1% live. TIP: The best views are behind you, if you walk with the traffic (ocean on your right). We like to start from the other direction and walk with the ocean on our left."
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,A fairy tale,5.0 of 5 bubbles,populated by elves and magicians. And artists.
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,Scenic Road Walkway ranked high for a reason,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There is ample parking at the end of Ocean Blvd. It is about a one block walk south on Scenic Drive to reach the walkway. Great Ocean views on one side and fascinating houses on the other. It is about a 3 mile round trip. There is a restroom located near the South end of the walk. Perfect morning excursion.
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,Better than 17 mile Drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Maybe our expectation was too high for 17 mile drive how it is advertised and even charges an entrace fee.  We stumbled upon this on a map and decided to take this route to Point Lobos.  Glad we did.  Really awesome scenery and houses along the route.
Scenic Road Walkway,5.0,Carmel Coastal Trail to Carmel River State Beach and points beyond,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great walk, but don't stop when you reach Carmel River State Beach (continue walking to Mission Ranch and then the Carmel Mission).  Walk, do. not. drive.  All the beauty unfolds at a much slower pace than a drive-by affords.  "
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Popular place,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived about 11 am on a fall Friday, and this place was already crowded. The falls themselves are very pretty, but the overall hike wasn't as spectacular as several other attractions in the Hocking Hills area. Coming out, the trail is a bit challenging, especially when there are lots of people trying to go through very narrow passageways."
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Beuatiful waterfall and hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There is a bathroom at the parking area.  The trail is marked well. It is a loop. So one way. We got a map at the Welcome Center so we were prepared. Take your camera or video camera's and have fun. Such a peaceful place to get out enjoy yourself in the great outdoors! The waterfall is so pretty and different than others the way it parts and flows around the big rock in the middle. There is a cave over to the side of the waterfall. if you arrange yourself in just the right spot to take pics it looks like you can either catch the water or it is falling upon your head. Very cool. The loop back is better than the first part I thought. Yes there are a lot of stairs. The loop comes out down from the parking lot so you have to walk just a bit to get to your car.
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Better with less people.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,This is another beautiful hiking trail/path in the Hocking Hills area.
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Short hike to scenic views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Take the steps down to the gorge. Then you walk along the trail with hemlocks and beautiful rock formations to the falls. There is a hidden falls that you can hear just before Cedar Falls that I’d seen recommend to look at, but you aren’t allowed to go off the path to see it. You can only look from the steps up leading away from Cedar Falls. On your way out, look back at the stones cut out for the board walk area. It is a beautiful site. The one way signs take you to the far end and you walk back to the parking area on the road."
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Hiking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiked to the falls from the fire tower. Was a longer trail than I thought.  Wish there was more information on the trail on how far it was. We had to ask others how much further since we had no idea and at one point we came to an area we thought might of been the falls but it was just park of the rock formation. The falls were nice but too many people were in the water around the falls, not obeying the sign no swimming or wading in the water. Maybe they could have a seasonal worker try to enforce the rules during the busy season."
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Nice short trail to view falls,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a well done trail with steps on every grade on the way to the falls.  They decided to make it one way and this means you must go through a narrow passage that is A bit difficult.  Not for anyone with mobility issues.  
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Gorgeous trail and waterfalls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,One of my favorite waterfalls in Hocking Hills State Park! We took the long way around starting at old mans cave (many waterfalls along that trail!) but there is a convenient parking lot right next to cedar falls you can park at and walk down a few flight of steps and boom Cedar Falls! Highly recommend checking it out after a little bit of rainfall
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,"Easy Trail, Great VIews",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very simple trail and reasonably easy.  We got there kind of early to beat any crowds and glad we did.  By the time we were off the trail (around 11), the parking lots were full.  Nice facilities, and solid footing all the way through.  The fact that it connects to other trails is pretty nice.  You can hear the falls and the water almost the entire time you are on the trail."
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Must see waterfall in Hocking Hills. Easy hike with the dogs.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The parking is clearly marked with signage a few miles beforehand and leading up to the trailhead.
Cedar Falls Hiking Trail,4.5,Beautiful Falls. Lots of steps down and up. Very crowded popular falls. FREE.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It takes about 30 min. to visit this falls.  Distance is maybe 1/2 mile.  Stay longer to enjoy the view.  Parking lot for about 40 cars, with an 8 car overflow lot on another road, but that is not nearly enough room, so people just park all over the grass, creating ruts and a mess.  They have made this falls a one way in, and one way out.   Both ways have lots of steps.   The steps need some TLC, so people have just started paths on each side of the steps.   The steps are too deep and it makes it more difficult to take the steps.  There are really nice modern big restrooms at the entrance and a covered pavilion with tables for picnics.   Some  picnic tables scattered around the parking area.   I was here years ago before the modern restrooms, I am glad they put these in.   I was surprised by the number of people (families) visiting the falls.   As usual, people leave their trash at the falls,, very disappointing.  Most people were polite and thoughtful, some people go off trail where the signs say; restoration area- “do not enter”.   This is a beautiful falls, but there are many steps down and many steps to get up, so consider that before you take this trip. If you want to avoid the crowds of people, come before 9:00 am and after 6:00 pm at night."
Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,The Overrated Loop,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"The drive is somewhat overrated. Between narrow roads and potholes make a somewhat anxious scenic loop. Cyclists go home. You don’t belong here. Florida had so many places to ride, why come here? Plus Defend the loop signs everywhere... I vote for the Casings. Rockefeller’s winter home  on the river and the 1 way drive departing where you see a beautiful lined street and doesn’t take 40 minutes. Go to the beach !!!"
Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,Untamed nature,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The drive along the scenic loop began well with an impressive tunnel of oak trees . The road took us past the ruins of a mill and past a lake, where we stopped to speak to a man fishing.  We learned that flounder and whiting, amongst other fish are in the lake. We managed to see a few regrets and a heron, but not much else. The road branches several times, but nothing is marked and, after a while,  we assumed we were lost and tried to retrace our path. It's a lovely,  natural 30- plus miles. Maybe you'll have better luck!"
Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,Beautiful Drive,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The loop has 2 branches, one is actually A1A and you can take it all the way to St. Augustine. The loop goes by a very nice state park also. Part of the loop on one branch goes through a residential neighborhood along the intercoastal which can be very busy depending on the time of day(kids on bikes, UPS, Garbage trucks etc.). But all in all it is a beautiful scenic drive. It is advertised as a great multi purpose trail but some parts are not very bicycle friendly."
Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,Driving the Loop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A nice way to see the ocean and surrounding area.  It was a beautiful day.

Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,A Nice Way to Spend 1 - 2 Hours,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Don't going expect to say WOW as if visiting Disney or Universal, but it you want to spend a relaxing couple of hours taking a slow drive around the loop, it's worth it.  Beautiful old Florida scenery.  I read some reviews claiming pot holes in the road and only suitable for bikes.  Not so!  The roads were fine.  Narrow in some spots.  Would not be good to do on a rainy day."
Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,Gopher Tortoises!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The drive to the location is great. The GPS took us to Tomoka State Park, which only had a parking fee. We saw a lot of gopher tortoises by the roads. There is a monument that was built to honor the Natives who lived here when the Europeans showed up. There was a shaded waking trail that went right up to the water of the inlet. We saw little crabs. I do recommend visiting it at least once!"
Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,Drive is great,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Such a cool ride, tunnels through trees, marshland, beautiful homes and history.   Live oaks, some very old.   We did the loop first during the day and then did it again at night to see all the holiday lighting.  Great experience."

Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,Old Florida at its Best,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful part of old Florida. When we went the water was right up to the road in several places.

Ormond Scenic Loop & Trail,4.5,Great ride through a part of old Florida,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Living here, I take the loop or parts of it almost monthly or more.  My recommendation is to start at SR 40 and Beach Street next to Ormond Beach City Hall, go north on Beach Street all the way to Walter Boardman Road..Go east to the stop sign and turn right on Highbridge through the winding curves.  Speed limit is only 30 or less and if someone starts tailgating, just pull over and then get back on the road after they pass and enjoy the view.. "
Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Gorgeous day hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hard but beautiful and very doable trail.  At the top (last 15 minutes) there's snow and ice and it can get slick.   It's also a little tough to find the tail in the snow.   It's worth going a little  past the tram to the overlooks.  Juneau is so beautiful!  It was too snowy to go up to the cross.   Highly recommend!
Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Great hike with stunning views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had some spare time while in Juneau and we decided to go for a hike on Mount Roberts Trails. There are a few different route to choice from. It is also very steep but has a well maintained trail. There is also some stunning view points over looking Juneau. If you like being outdoors and hiking this is a great place to spend a few hours while in Juneau.
Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Challenging inclines but worth the views!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to walk the trail up to Mount Roberts and take the gondola down. We walked from the ship port, the trail was well signed posted up until we passed over a bridge then unfortunately the trail was obscured by parked cars, we ended up walking to the perseverance trail so we knew we had gone too far, we had to back track. We asked for directions and got on the Mount Roberts trail, be sure to keep an eye out for the path we were not the only ones that missed it that day."
Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Great Views By The Cross!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked up to the cross. The hike was a good workout. The trail is wide in spots and also more narrow with some roots and rocks but well maintained. It is mildly strenuous but we made it considering two of us were not in great shape. Worth the hike, but if you have health issues, you should probably not hike it."
Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Not that easy trail but beautiful!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I read reviews about this trail and researched about the trail online. It said ‘easy’ trail. I have to disagree with this. I’m 36yrs and in good shape. I don’t hike regularly but I walk my dog daily. So I thought this trail will not be difficult for me. Apparently it’s not easy as I thought. I came to Juneau on the second week of May. On the top of the mountain is still covered with snow! I had a walking sneakers on and struggled with the snow a bit (see pictures I posted). I didn’t expect the trial will be all snow! Other than that, the trail is beautiful. We saw some bold eagles flying on the top of the mountain. It took us about 2 hrs to hike from the trailhead to the tram. We rode the tram down. It’s going to be a good memory when I get old that I’ve done this hike!"
Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great day hike. Don't take the tram up though, you miss the rain forest and a very pretty part of the hike. We started in town with temps in the 50's and made the top in 3-4 hours. At the top it was below freezing, we were in the clouds and the wind was screaming. It was almost like climbing a real mountain. It is a real mountain!"
Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Climbing Mt. Roberts in Juneau,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We recently enjoyed a Alaska Cruise Tour on the ""Diamond Princess"" and one of the stops was in Juneau. We took the tram to the top of Mt. Roberts on a previous trip and enjoyed it very much. This time a waiter in a local restaurant told us that there is a easy path up to the top and once you are there , all you need to do is spend $5.- per person in the mountain top Restaurant and you can take the tram down for free. The regular fare is $29.-."
Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Great views with plenty of options!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The close proximity to town and alternate access from the Goldbelt Tram(for a price) makes this trail extremely popular. The tram is located in the middle of the Cruise ship dock downtown and the trailhead is located just after the trestle bridge on Basin Road. The initial ascent is much more friendly than its cousin across the valley, Mt. Juneau. About two miles up the trail, users will hit the Mountain House which, during the summer, is a nice bathroom stop and water fill up before continuing on. The Nature Center across the way has updated trail and weather information. There are guided and self guided tours, as well as information plaques around a half mile loop from the top of the tram."

Mount Roberts Trail,4.5,Breathtaking Views and an Amazing Impact on your Senses,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This use to be my best escape for a nice afternoon walk when I used to work on Cruise Ships. Every 7th day our ship use to be in Juneau Alaska during the peak season time. Often I used to come out around 1100am and take a tram up to this mountain and do this hike on Mount Roberts Trail. I have loved every bit of it specially the weather. Being an India coming from a busy metro city this kind of weather is a Dream come true, where there is ample of sunlight to recharge every cell of your body but at the same time you do not feel the heat exhaustion in spite of walking for a good one hour in the sun, now that's amazing from my prospective. Also along with the bright sun light you get this nice mild breeze of cold fresh air, such a rare combination. Of course this kind of weather is during the Alaska Season time only. But for me most of the time I visited and hiked this trail, I have been lucky to have this weather 9 out of 10 times. This trail is a must do for Couple / Family or Solo Traveler to help you either bond with your partner / have amazing time with family enjoying the glorious day / or to walk the earth alone and connect with the deepest part of yourself.

Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,Nice choice for sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose to hike this 1.5 mile round trip trail near sunset, which gave us some lovely views with the setting sun over Lake Michigan."
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,Easy hike with a breathtaking view at the end,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the best experiences for us. With just about 1.5 miles round trip hike with moderate or low difficulty slopes under mostly shaded trail, the reward at the end is an extremely breathtaking view of Lake Michigan. The parking lot is kind of small but we saw cars parked outside on grass and in general people tend to return back quickly. After this trail, we also went to the Empire Beach (within about 5 minutes drive) which is also a nice place to relax with a gorgeous view and clear water."
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,Worth the view at the end,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I were traveling around Lake Michigan.  We did this hike while visiting Sleeping Bear Dunes.  We are late 50’s, average condition and we had no trouble with this hike.  The views over Lake Michigan at the end are very worth it.  There are benches at the top to enjoy the view."
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,A nice easy introduction to Sleeping Bear Dunes.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After stopping at the visitor center in Empire, and waiting out a brief shower, we tackled this easy trail with spectacular lake views.  The trail cuts through the woods before emerging overlooking Lake Michigan and ends with a small boardwalk area. "
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,September hiking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was kinda steep uphill, but there were many pieces of wood that worked as steps.  Many young kids and older folks were making it.  There was a boardwalk at the top with awesome views, even on a partly cloudy day."
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,A walk and a stunner.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Breathtaking endpoint after a .7 mile trail walk. The view of Lake Michigan at the end of this trail is stunning.  From afar the Great Bear Sand Dunes can be seen. The water is deep blue in the middle and a clear gorgeous green close to shore. At the end of the trail the terrain is sandy and the park service has installed a boardwalk to help with footing. The trail is steep in a few spots.  It may not be an easy walk for someone with extreme mobility or health issues. 1.5 miles round trip. Plenty of parking. There is an bathroom facility at the trailhead.
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,Best hike around Empire,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I did about 4 short hikes around Empire in one day, and this was, by far, our favorite.   It is uphill, but mostly gradual with some flat spots between.   People of all ages were doing this trail.  The views are spectacular, and there are a few benches at the top to sit and enjoy.    A couple of spots on the trail were tight, but people were respectful about proper distancing and a few wore masks."
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,Favorite Sleeping Bear Dunes hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the prettiest hikes and views in the northwest lower Michigan peninsula! It's only a 1.5 mile hike and quite easy. There's a section of steps and a bit of steepness on a slope but it's not hard. (Watch out for the poison ivy on the edge of the trail when you get to the boardwalk section.)  If you're in the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore area, be sure to check it out. A national park pass is required for parking."
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,Great Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"At the welcome center, they give you a slip with directions on how to get to the trailhead. Parking does require a pass but it will last you six days. I believe it was $25 for a non-Michigan license plate. The whole time I was there I was confused as to which trail I was on because the map had the trails designated by numbers, but once you are at the Empire Bluffs trailhead, you're on the Empire Bluff Trail. Just follow the main path and ignore those confusing trail markers. I saw on ""hiketok"" that this was a must-do hike before you die. The views were great, I would recommend. The hike is more like a moderate nature walk, but beware if it is windy, you're probably going to get sand in your eyes when you get to the top (when the boardwalk ends in a circe)."
Empire Bluff Trail,5.0,EBT,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a pretty easy 1.5 mile hike. The trail is about 6-8 feet wide in most spots, making it easy to stay pretty far away from folks headed in other direction. Right before you pop out on the face of the dune it is only 2-3 feet wide. Most of the uphill portions are on the way to the bluffs, though there are a couple of uphill spots on the way back to the car. There is a pit toilet at the head of the trail. The breeze is very nice at the end of the trail and the view is fantastic. A nice viewing platform with a couple of benches awaits."
Skyline Trail,5.0,One of the Best Hikes in the NPS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the number 1 rated hike in the state of Washington by AllTrails and one of the most amazing hikes in the NPS.  We woke up early on our second day at the park after spending the night at Paradise Inn and hiked this trail.  The weather was great and we could see the peak the entire time.  By the end of the trail, the sun had come out and the meadows were magical.  Whether looking out at 3 other volcanic Cascades, Adams, Hood (in Oregon) and St. Helen's, from Panorama Point or viewing the glaciers and peak from below, this hike is amazing.  "
Skyline Trail,5.0,Lots of snow on this trail so crampons are helpful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of our favorite hikes on Mt. Rainier except this year there was 85% snow on the trail when we hiked on July 22.   The ranger told us that Mt. Rainier had 130 inches more snow than last year so lots of snow on this trail.  We had hiking boots, trekking poles  and our micro spikes. Several tourists were in sneakers and slipping and sliding along the way.  I'm sure their feet got  wet from the slushy snow. Please consult Mt. Rainier's website to check on snow levels so you can be prepare to hike on this trail.  It isn't an easy hike. The clouds were covering Mt. Rainier in the morning but cleared up by the time we reach McCure rock. You could see Mt. Adams also.   Stunning  views of the mountain and waterfall.  We like to start at the end of the trail (near Paradise Lodge) by going down the trail instead of going up.  There is less people this direction.  When we were coming down from Panoramic Point there was a bottleneck along one  narrow section of the trail as many tourists are coming up this way."
Skyline Trail,5.0,Amazing trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started at the visitors center but it doesn’t show here because we accidentally ended the hike on the app.  Tips first: Get there early.  We arrived at 7:30 and the parking lot was packed.  It was a Sunday and the weather was perfect.  That could’ve had something to do with it.  Starting early will also keep you more in the shade and cooler.  Go clockwise.  Use your sunscreen!  The sun can be brutal.  Walking poles are a plus too.  Bugs weren’t bad at all.  Slow and steady is the way to go.  It’s a tough incline at the start and the finish.  It took us 4 hrs 9 min and we did lots of stops just to soak in the beauty.  Plenty of snow can be seen still but very little on the trail.  The snow that is on the trail is super slushy and slippery.  We slid down with garbage bags which was a hoot!  Trail is well marked.  There’s plenty of wildlife and we saw a sooty grouse, lots of marmots and chipmunks too.  There was a lot of wildflowers too."
Skyline Trail,5.0,Among the best of the best,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We have hiked many NP trails and this one gets into the top three trails of all time (so far!). If you are only going to do one thing at Mt. Rainier, this is it. It IS strenuous but little kids and adults in their 70s were doing it—just at a slower pace. It is so beautiful you will forget all about the effort to get to the top once you are there."
Skyline Trail,5.0,Highlights of Rainier in 4 hours,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I visited on a clear Sunday at about 7:30am. The main lot was almost full and the overflow was about half full. The hike is not terribly challenging. It gets labeled as strenuous, but that's probably due to its popularity and wanting to instill some kind of caution in the crowds. Clockwise is the way to go on this one. If you go on a clear day, you will have view of Rainier for almost the entire hike. You will also spot glacial falls, wildflowers, marmots, chipmunks, Myrtle Falls, Mt Adams and St Helens in the distance, and probably snow in spots. It's a great overview hike that gets the best of Rainier, but the crowds would likely steer me away on subsequent trips. Most high elevation hikes will get you views of Rainier if the weather cooperates. On the way back, there were several parking spots open around 11:30am. It seems like 8-10 or 11 is probably the worst time to arrive, but otherwise I think you are fine. Definitely one to do for the highlights of the park, but you may want to venture off the beaten path on future visits."
Skyline Trail,5.0,Skyline busy but nice; also do the Paradise Glacier Trail for fun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great trail; definitely need to be able to climb, and have good hiking shoes etc. We did the hike clockwise (recommended), as you have great view of Mt. Rainier. This trail is very crowded be early (before 8 am) to get a parking spot. We made a short side trail ( out and back 2 mile extra) to Paradise Glacier Trail; that is fun as where the maintained path ends, the glacier starts and you can walk (safely) on it."
Skyline Trail,5.0,Experience winter in June,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Skyline Trail would not be an especially challenging trail but for the fact that it is covered in snow, even in late June.  And since the trail traverses steep hills and cliffs, a slip or a misstep can be a big problem.  Hiking boots were barely sufficient and I wished I had poles or spiked shoes.  The trail itself provides magnificent views of Mt. Rainier and the surrounding mountain ranges, picturesque Myrtle Falls, and wildlife viewing (I saw mountain goats and marmots).  This is Mt. Rainier's most popular trail for a reason, and it's highly advisable to get there to start before 10 am when the crowds arrive."
Skyline Trail,5.0,Amazing views but hard work,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were here in June and a lot of this trail was still covered in snow. It is worth every second of work you will put in to get the the highest viewpoint. You will also need to be able to navigate being off trail, because of the snow. Be sure to have micro spikes for your shoes and also hiking poles."
Skyline Trail,5.0,"Challenging, but worth it",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My 4 teenage sons & I wore tennis shoes, shorts, & sweatshirts.  We were totally fine without hiking gear.  We were a bit chilly near the peak, but it felt refreshing.  There were actually toilets  (outhouses) near Panorama Point."
Skyline Trail,5.0,Solo hiking…,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Went for a walk and saw some amazing things.  Maybe I should have carried bear spray yet ended up not needing it.  
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,"Fun time, but pricey",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful place, but badly overpriced. We paid roughly $40 per person for the combo golf cart & museum tour, plus had to pay an additional $10 just to park. Refreshments are insanely expensive as well ($5 for a small lemonade). The golf cart tour only takes about an hour. The cart path is only wide enough for one cart, so be prepared to get stopped behind other tourists at times (especially at the cave entrance). Most of the scenic spots have parking areas so that you can park the golfcart and not be in the way of others. The museum was incredible. We were told it would take 1-2 hours, but spent 3+ hours there, and that was with us skimming the last few rooms."
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,Lot of fun.....but,3.0 of 5 bubbles,First you thing you should know is they charge you $10 a car to even get on the property. Which isn’t a lot but it seems they have a hand out everywhere you go. For four adults to take this trail ride it cost us around $146. It was fun ...but not that fun. When we went to drive the cart into the cave there was a line of carts to get through it. We thought people where taking pictures but in reality they where all stopping to buy drinks from a bar in the cave. While we did have a good time I thought it was way over priced for what it was. We will definitely not do it again. 
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,Loads of fun for the whole family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the most fun we've had on a vacation when we rented their golf carts to tour the grounds of the Big Cedar Lodge.  You definitely need reservations in advance to get a cart but then you drive yourself on a paved path all around their caves and natural sights with waterfalls and lots of vegetation.  In the summer months the golf cart path is pretty crowded so you can't be in a hurry to get anywhere but that allows you plenty of time to stop at each sight along the way and get out and take pictures before continuing on your way.  It's confusing what this attraction is called but it appears to be ""Top of the Rock Lost Canyon Cave and Nature Trail"" at Big Cedar Lodge.  It's quite pricey but loads of fun."
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,Perfect day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did this tour right after it rained one morning so the weather was perfect it was overcast and cool. I believe you could have done it even in the rain because the cart you are on keeps you decently covered. Driving through the cave and getting a drink was a lot of fun. Overall it was a very neat experience with beautiful views we took lots of great photographs. At one point if you drive too close to a waterfall you will get a little wet. Adds to the Fun! Great for any age.
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,Beautiful scenery and a unique way to enjoy seeing it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband, who is in a wheelchair, opted not to go with us since it would have been a bit difficult for him to get in the golf cart.  But the rest of our group very much enjoyed this tour, which took around 50 minutes, as they described.  Beautiful scenery and a very good way for us to start our trip in Branson and at Top of the Rock.  Be aware that parking is a bit odd.  You have to park at this area for the Lost Canyon tour and then be shuttled over to the main area where the museum and restaurants are.  Either that, or pay $15 extra for valet parking...which we figured was worth it since my husband was in a wheelchair. "
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,Wonderful fun and nature's splendor,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a special experience amidst our Ozark adventures! Here at a steamy time in July of 2021, we too wanted to be socially distanced due to Covid. This was the perfect adventure! Each family unit or couple get their own golf cart to take through the canyon. Though it is a little pricey, especially when adding the 10 dollar parking fee, we thought it was worth it and really enjoyed our experience!"
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,Beautiful views like no other!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was so much fun! I wasn’t sure how our 4 and 2 year olds would like it, but they both loved it as well as our teenager. The cave was really cool & the bar inside is a nice touch, there’s even a screen on the golf cart to order ahead. There were so many beautiful waterfalls & views of the lake, with parking spots along the way so you can safely stop for photos. We even saw a groundhog, which the kids have not stopped talking about since! It was so nice to be outside doing something different as a family, it would be a romantic date for sure & I imagine lots of proposals have taken place alone the way!"
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,One of a kind tour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a wonderful time enjoying the weather and spectacular views from the trail. The waterfalls were amazing, and the bat cave was a fun attraction. The museum was so much more extensive than I was expecting! Plan on spending some time there. I had read a couple of reviews, not realizing they were from 2019. So don’t be surprised when you get there and the tickets are $41 per person, not $25. Staff is very friendly and helpful."
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,Fabulous Activity,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was skeptical about whether or not this would be worth the cost ($34 each) but we are so glad we did this. It was so much fun, especially driving into the cave and past the Cave Bar. We liked that part so much we did it twice! There are many places to stop along the golf cart drive to enjoy the sites and waterfalls. The developer of this resort and its activities has done a fabulous job developing a beautiful piece of property into something everyone can enjoy. "
Lost Canyon Nature Trail and Cave,4.5,Very Enjoyable Experience,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"As some noted, there is an additional $10 parking fee, the speed of the cart is limited, the Bar Bar congests the cave, and you can end up in bumper to bumper traffic.  The early you book your tickets, the less expensive it will be.  I also noted an evening special.  That might be worth exploring to see if traffic is lighter.  The grounds and views are beautiful.  "
Double Arch,5.0,Too many people!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This arch is very cool, but it is an absolute zoo of people to see.  Because it is visible from the road and a short walk over essentially a paved path, it's very popular (as are the nearby Double Window Arches and the Turret Arch).  If you are able to, skip this and hike to some of the more remote arches and avoid the families with wagons full of kids slogging along the path."
Double Arch,5.0,"Short, easy trail with an excellent payoff",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This short (0.5 mi/0.8 km) out-and-back trail features one of the most impressive formations in Arches National Park, the famous “Double Arch.”  To reach the trailhead, take the Windows Road off the main Arches Scenic Drive (the turnoff is near Balanced Rock) to the end of the road, which takes you directly into the parking area for the Windows Loop Trail.  You can either park there or continue a little further to the parking area right in front of the Double Arch trailhead."
Double Arch,5.0,Easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Double Arch is unreal. It is massive and breathtaking, especially with the clear blue sky in the windows of the arches. You can climb directly into the lower arch if you are brave enough (there is a sheer drop on the other side!) The hike up to the arch is easy, then once you get to the arch you can do some rock scrambling to go higher. In the middle of the day (noon-ish) there were a lot of people around and it was crowded. It was also very hot as the heat reflected off the stone. You will definitely need a hat and sunglasses when making the short hike from the parking lot to the arch. Nonetheless, it is an impressive site to see!"
Double Arch,5.0,Another Arches Must-See,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A favorite in Arches NP - if you are able to get a parking spot, keep it and hike it. On one side is the amazing Double Arches and on the other the Windows and Turret Arch. Keep hydrated and wear proper shoes! There are restrooms near the parking area as needed. The Double Arch is one of the most spectacular works of nature that I've ever seen. You can climb up higher into the Arch, if you wish, but I opted to sit in the shade for a tad since it was ""spicy"" out, as my kid would say."
Double Arch,5.0,Double Arch is Double Fun !!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We felt this area of Arches National Park was the most special.  They call this the Windows area and there are plenty of windows of large and small windows that show the various arches.  The double arch is so surreal and you get to walk right up to it and actually climb in it.
Double Arch,5.0,Amazing Arch - Signature Sight MUST SEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the miracle Must See Arches within the park.  This formation is so unique with multiple arches and it is made for pictures.  It is a short walk from the Windows so one stop in the parking lot can net you two of the best sights in the park.  I will say Double Arch is better and more amazing, but you need to see the Windows.  It is truly great that they are right next to each and easily seen from one parking space.  Additionally the parking lot between the two attractions has a restroom that was also a big hit with our group.  Be sure to make time to see this amazing Arch and you will be rewarded."
Double Arch,5.0,Best Spot in the Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"To me, this was the best assortment of rock formations all accessible from one parking lot.  Get here early to avoid the crowds, as parking is limited although it's a larger lot than other locations.  It's known for glowing at sunset, but the sunrise is equally amazing and peaceful.  If you're into photography, the shadows cast as sunrise are spectacular.  And look for a knob of rock on your left as you walk back to the parking lot from Double Arch.  I think it looks like Homer Simpson's head.  D'oh!"
Double Arch,5.0,Double the amazement,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It looks pretty cool from a  distance, but as you get closer, you gain a different perspective and can really appreciate the beauty and uniqueness of these two arches together.  It is a short , mostly flat walk to the arches but still a very hot one so be prepared with water. It is is an amazing experience getting up close to these arches and being able to climb it."
Double Arch,5.0,"Nice, easy climb to pretty double arch.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Pretty view.  Half mile hike if you start in the second parking lot.  If you park in the first lot (upper lot but first one you come to on one way road in) you are closer to the windows hike.  We did what you should do in this very busy park and took the first spot we saw, which was in the first lot.  Since it was rainy, we decided to skip the one mile hike to the windows and instead, climbed down the steps to the lower second lot to the trailhead to the double arch.  Lots of folks climbed into and all over the arches but we had a great view for photos at the end of the dirt path and did not venture further in the rain on the wet rocky path leading to under the arches."
Double Arch,5.0,A Beautiful Arch and a Simple Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My son and I hiked the easy trail to Double Arch.  The hike is pretty and the area at the base of the Arch is wonderful to explore.  Of course the Double Arch is one of the most famous in the park.  This is really easy and worth doing.  It is also worthwhile to just find a place to sit and look at the Arches.  If you hurry through every arch to see everything you miss the opportunity to real admire the beauty of the place. I recommend a visit to Double Arch.
Forest Park,4.5,Great rustic outdoors  park for walking!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We enjoyed this great outdoors  park that has lots of walking trails some of which are pretty rough and definitely rugged.  Lots of great views.  Not for the faint of heart as trails are often thin with major drop offs beside them.  Port a potties available if needed.  A great place for a walk with lots of options some of which are noticeably steep.  Recommended!
Forest Park,4.5,Good Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hike to the Witches Castle, is really ""the hike"".  The castle is just an old brick building filled with graffiti.  I still enjoyed seeing it.  However, the hike (if you don't hike) is not flat as described and the lower level trail was closed (we didn't know that until we got to the castle.  This meant we had to go back uphill the way we came (didn't want to do that) or find our way out another direction (which we did with the help of a local).  beautiful forest.  "
Forest Park,4.5,Good but not as grand as I expected.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I liked it, it was worth seeing. Would I go again? Probably not. If I lived there I would utilize it. But it claims it's the largest urban forest in America, but that is incorrect. The Trinity Forest (Dallas, TX) is more than a 1000 acres larger and is the largest in America."
Forest Park,4.5,Pretty hike even though it rained,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Word to the wise: in the winter, wear good hiking boots! That said, our adventure was so beautifula nd lush. Everything was packed with mosses and ferns. I wish I had a hiking trail into a magical forest in my backyard like the lucky Portlanders!"
Forest Park,4.5,Miles of beautiful hiking trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hard to believe that such a huge and beautiful park is so close to downtown Portland. I stayed in Portland without a car, and walked from my hotel to Pittock Mansion, and then picked up the Wildwood trail.  Trails are well maintained and well marked.  Dogs are allowed on leash, and bikes are allowed on some trails."
Forest Park,4.5,Spend A Day Here,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an incredibly beautiful forest to walk around in. If you have the time you can easily spend the whole day there. Lots of undulation so if that’s a difficulty walking need to be considerate of that. But the walking trails are really well paved. Overall rating 9.7
Forest Park,4.5,Great place but does get busy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Love this park but it does get quite busy. Parking is a little wonky but glad me and my friend that I was taking pictures of found a couple spots. Great area especially with the stone house and the little creek. It was gorgeous summer day.

Forest Park,4.5,Not Enough Stars for This Wonderful Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,(This is an update of a popular review.)
Forest Park,4.5,Witches Castle,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We only explored the trail to the Witches Castle, which was easily accessible and more of a stroll than a hike. The trail leads down the bottom of a steep canyon, with moss hanging from all the branches and the feeling that you're in another mysterious world, far from the city. The old stone building that is the Witches Castle would be a great place to film a horror movie!"
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,"A bit overcrowded, especialy where the biggest trees are fenced",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are several tours to walk here. You can follow the signs of dwell around. The idea is that the further you get away from the cultivated paths, the lesser people you have on your pictures. Of course these biggest trees are nice, but they are so popular that some of them have fences around them. When you walk further away from the parking lot, you will be able to wander around in the woods, between the giant trees or sit and watch for a few minutes without being disturbed.  Personally I liked the few small groups of Sequoia's more, than the biggest ones. Even the 'small' ones can be very impressive."
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,take time to enjoy this place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You have to walk a substantial distance to get around Grant Grove and see the General Grant tree, but its very worth it. Several other interesting sights are on this trail. Like the General Sherman tree you can't get very close to the tree or touch it for its own protection."
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,Beware of the Fallen Monarch!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Never made it to General Grant, I foolishly decided to take a look inside the Fallen Monarch. On the root side of the tree, there are some steps down- they are uneven and unsafe -just wanted to warn fellow travelers. The light was not in my favor at 3pm and I was worried about hitting my head going down the steps. I should have been more worried about where I was planting my feet because I ended up with a broken fibula after hitting the super low next step."
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,One of the Must Stops,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This short loop trail provides you with a great view of the General Grant Grove.  There are a number of massive trees as well as the General Grant Tree.  The General Grant Tree is the largest in the world in circumference at the base of the tree.  This trail also includes a downed sequoia that you can walk into at root level and exit at the other end of the tree...it gives one a sense of just how massive these trees are from top to bottom.
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,Impressive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"General grant tree is beautiful and impressive. Plenty of parking, to see the tree is a short hike but there is so much more to explore. We got to walk inside a Sequoia tree...that was a highlight. We spend a few hours here and even though there was many other visitors it never felt crowded.This is a must if visiting Kings Canyon."
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,Easy hike for a must see!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"1/3 mile, paved trail. The General Grant tree is the 3rd largest tree in the world and the widest (trunk is 40 ft across)!"
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,A must see,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail takes you to a number of fabulous sequoias. It's am easy walk and you get to see The Grant Tree, which is truly amazing! You have to see it in person to really appreciate its size. Although there was a line of people to take a picture with it, it was all very orderly and friendly. A lovely experience. "
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,A  must stop in this park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Maybe with the exception of the Big Trees Trail, the best way to see the sequoias.  A wide, paved path in a loop around the namesake tree and others that are well marked with interpretive signs.  If you only have time for a day this would be on the list. "
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,Impressive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very Impressive.  Amazing to see these trees.  One one side is a limb that fell that was huge and they have not moved it, so you can get an idea of the size of the other limbs hanging above you.  We spent some time climbing the nearby rocks as well. Weather was good so we did not need the chains on this day."
General Grant Tree Trail,4.5,Great trail with plenty to see while hiking within the grove,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The General Grant Tree Trail is an easy .5 mile loop trail around the General Grant sequoia tree at the Grant Grove in Kings Canyon National Park. This is the second largest tree in the world by volume only surpassed by the General Sherman tree in the Giant Forest further south in  Sequoia National Park. 
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,TERRIBLE,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Staff at the Lodge could have been more friendly and accomodating due to COVID restrictions. Manager of state park very rude and short with us. We booked a 2 bedroom cabin for 2 nights and had to stay in different cabins each night. Had to actually pack everything and check out of one cabin to check into another one, which was time consuming and took away from our vacation time. The first day we checked in, we were able to enter lodge without having to wear a mask but the next when checking out of one cabin into other cabin the manager rudely told us to go outside and put on mask. We choose not to wear mask so asked if we could just be waited on curbside as they already had our credit card info, etc. His answer was no. Subsequently we ended up not staying the second day and went to Petit Jean State Park to stay. They were very accomodating and handled everything over the phone and met us outside with cabin key stating how sorry they were for any inconvinience....."
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,WOW!! Get ready to walk.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are 50+ and greatly enjoyed our stay at Cameron Bluff Campground. The price was just $35 and we had a clean, wide, leveled campsite with full hook up. It also has a raised tent space (some people had small blow-up pools for the kids). We were at site #3, in the front close to the very clean showers. The site was easy to get into and not too close to others. But don't just go for the campground! There are beautiful overviews that can easily be enjoyed from your car or you can traverse down well groomed paths to get a closer look. We also walked several nice trails that were not too long (less that 2 miles) including the Signal Hill Trail to the top of the mountain, not a difficult trail but be prepared for stiff knees the next day.  There are much longer and more challenging trails for the ambitious."
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,Beautiful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We have camped at Mt. Magazine in our RV and love site 6. It is a nice walk to the Cameron Bluff overlook from the campground. The Benefield East loop is the best short hike with amazing views. We stayed in the lodge this past month and enjoyed gorgeous views of both sunset and sunrise from our balcony. Ask for which rooms are best view. This beautiful park has lots of hiking. We had a good breakfast in Paris. The staff there are super friendly and and can give info on the shops in town. We love Mt. Magazine Park just as it is. One of the many great Arkansas State Parks. 
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,Stayed in the cabins,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Cabins:
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,Take groceries with you if you rent a cabin,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our girls trip this year was to a cabin at Mt Magazine October 25 to October 27, 2020.  We usually dine out on our trips.  We found that dining at Skycrest was very time consuming because of the facility being short staffed. The available staff was wonderful and worked together as a team.  Even the Park Ranger was there helping by busing tables.  The limited menu had really good food!  We decided that since we had a wonderful kitchen at the cabin, we would cook there.  We drove down the mountain to Paris to buy groceries at Walmart and CV's Family Foods.  Both stores were well stocked.  The cabin was probably the best place that we have rented during our travels and had a beautiful view.  All of the staff we encountered were fabulous in spite of being short handed."
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,Fun adventures,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked several trails while staying here and enjoyed lots of breathtaking views. We used an app called All trails to help us find some trails of varying difficulties. There were also adventure activities offered such as hang gliding, rock climbing, ATV tours, and horseback riding."
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,Quick trip to the high point of Arkansas,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were driving through the area and decided to make a quick stop for the short hike to the high point of Arkansas. The state park has other trails, but we took the short one up to Signal Hill, which has a nice sign marking the high point of the state. The walk was less than half a mail from where we parked, near a campground; you can also do a loop and/or access it from near the Lodge."
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,nice park disappointing high point,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a beautiful park with some expansive views from the lodge area. We hiked up to Signal Hill on Mt Magazine and although it is the highest point in Arkansas it was a bit disappointing as there was no view. The trail was good and atop was a bench and an information sign. There is also a large stone map of Arkansas and a sign in book for visitors.
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,Beautiful but don't go out of your way,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We thought the views were beautiful and the lodge with the original stone fireplace was majestic.  It is a nice place to take in the foliage.  To be fair, we did not stay overnight, just drove up to see the views and went on further north."
Mount Magazine State Park,4.5,Great place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice staff. Beautiful lodge/cabins with amazing view of the lake and hang gliders (at the right time of year). The restaurant is really good, especially the Friday night surf and turf buffet. No complaints at all. Just be prepared to drive 30 minutes if you need groceries or someplace else to eat."
Red Canyon,4.5,Escape the crowds and hike spectacular scenery!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband & I loved the Golden Wall/Buckhorn Trail. We started on the Golden Wall Trail, at the trailhead on Hwy 12 just west of the Red Canyon Visitor Center. After 2.8 miles and 500' elevation climb, the scenery only gets more majestic as you hike up and over the ridge. We hooked up with the Buckhorn Trail to the top of a magnificent vista before descending down on the Buckhorn Trail (.9 mile). We didn't encounter a single hiker the entire hike. Amazingly, benches have been placed along the Buckhorn Trail. The Buckhorn Trail ends in the Red Canyon Campground between site #24 & #26. We walked safely back to the Visitor Center on the bike trail.  This hike is not to be missed...the scenery is breathtaking and the solitude so captivating! We also enjoyed the short hikes: Birdseye Trail, Photo Trail & the Arches Trail. All great photo opportunities."
Red Canyon,4.5,Pink Ledges,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We found the walk at Pink Ledges just as intriguing and beautiful as walking the Queen's Garden at Bryce, just not as crowded. It was so delightful and for this 76 yr old woman with a 6 month old hip replacement a real thrill of accomplishment. I would even do it again in the opposite direction, really fun."
Red Canyon,4.5,Better than Bryce,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed it on the way to Bryce Canyon National Park, speeding by on the highway.  Then having spent the day in Bryce with the crowds,  narrow winding roads and steep drops, we spent hours here on the way to our hotel.  As a person with a pretty severe issue with heights, Bryce was a real struggle and the crowds made it very hard to enjoy the trails.  Red Canyon, just outside Bryce, was everything I had hoped from in Bryce.  I was able to walk the trails and experience the hoodoos, flora and fauna without being bumped and jostled.  While the trails were not wheelchair accessible, my husband who has significant mobility challenges was able to walk them with his canes.  The views from the many pull outs were fantastic.  The visitor's center was great, and the perfect place to enjoy the easier trails.  We got to feel like we really experienced the red rock hoodoo country and it was just awe inspiring."
Red Canyon,4.5,What a pleasure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our first time to the National Parks in southern Utah. On the way to Bryce, we stopped here at Red Canyon. Wow! What a pleasure. Beautiful scenery that is well named! We arrived after the Visitor Center was already closed, which was expected, but had done some quick research as to what we could enjoy with limited time. After snapping some photos with Smoky the Bear, it was Pink Ledges Trail for the win! We had the place to ourselves. It was awesome. Definitely recommended. We'll be back with more time in hand to explore more trails."
Red Canyon,4.5,Amazing views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Stopped here for a short hike on our way from Bryce to Vegas. Trail maps are available inside the visitor center. Trails are clearly marked and there is something for everyone. My husband and I hiked about an hour total and took in beautiful views of the rock formations. Longer trails are also available. Definitely recommend.
Red Canyon,4.5,Amazing Area for a Scenic Drive on Your Way to Bryce,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We stayed in Panguitch the night before a planned visit to Bryce Canyon National Park. We decided to scout out the area and explore the drive from Panguitch to the entrance to Bryce and were totally surprised by the unanticipated beauty as we drove through the Red Canyon area. Unbelievable beautiful rock formations along scenic highway 12. There are plenty of places to pull off and park so you can explore and photograph the area. No fees or permits are needed to drive through and take in the area. It gives you just a taste of what will await you when you go on to explore Bryce!
Red Canyon,4.5,beautiful scenery!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We passed through this area while driving Rt. 12 from Panguitch to Bryce Canyon National Park and then back home again. As all the posted photos attest, this area contains some beautiful rock formations. We did not hike in earnest but did walk the Pink Ledges Trail near the Visitor Center (see separate review). The scenery here rivals that at any of the national parks--even the gnarly trees are scenic here."
Red Canyon,4.5,Amazing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an amazing place to stop and get your hike on in the Red Canyon. Amazing pictures and nice hikes. We hiked the entire park in a few hours and got a ton of wonderful pictures. Stop and enjoy what it has to offer!
Red Canyon,4.5,Peaceful Beauty!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As travelers with a toddling toddler, we wanted something to do that was COVID-safe and family friendly. "
Red Canyon,4.5,Take Time to Stop Here,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful introduction to the things that you will see in Bryce Canyon! Be sure to either take some time before you visit Bryce or after to visit this area and walk some of the trails. The visitor center is nice with friendly people, maps, and a bathroom and they have several trails to choose from. We did the Arches Trail and it was beautiful. The colors and hoodoos are wonderful!"
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,Awesome!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fantastic!  Beautiful views totally worth the effort.  I cannot imagine doing this hike in the summer, so caution to be prepared for the weather.  We went in early December and were warm, though likely overdressed and overpacked."
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,A must do trail with spectacular views of Chisos Mountains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We heard the parking lot would be full way before 9am, and that hikers would do this trail before sun rise. Do we found our parking spot at 6:45am and went with our 8 year old. The trail is very clear and easy to see, even in the dark. It's a steady easy/moderate climb for 1 mile, that is totally worth going at any time if the day, but during sun rise it was very special. We decided to continue climbing and ended up going all the way to the end of the trail, which is more climbing. The view is spectacular in the end as well. It took us 2.5 hours to climb and 1.5 to get back to the car."
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,Favorite hike in Big Bend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed every trail we did in Big Bend but this almost 5 mile hike up and back was our favorite. The views are simply spectacular. If I can recommend anything is to get there early. Parking is limited at the trailhead. Also in October, though chilly at 8:00am, you warm up quickly so you will be happy to hike up in the shade. The hike up is primarily switchbacks (which makes it an easier downhill as well) so doable for me at 60. There was not a moment in this hike without great views. Make sure you keep walking across the rocks to get to the very top with amazing vistas. This is a must do in the Park. "
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,Best Hike we did at Big Bend!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the first hike we did at Big Bend National Park and it really wowed us!  We were staying in Alpine so it was a long 2 hour drive to parking.  We arrived around 8:40 am on Friday, October 29 and the small lot which holds 15 cars were pretty full already.  Only noticed 5 empty spots left.  There is another curve area next to it that holds 5 cars.  So in total, 20 parking spots are available.  Due to the limited parking, it also allows for few hikers on this trail.  "
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,Vast Park Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great, well maintained trail. We arrived at 7:45 and there were still spots available for parking so we drove to the visitors center really fast to use the restroom (there are none at the trailhead) and came back. Chilly morning and the sun was blocked by the ridge for most of the hike, but later in the day it probably gets pretty warm. Two kids under 10 were able to make it up and back in under 3 hours with lots of stops for snacks and to climb rocks. Main parking and both overflow lots were full when we ended so people were walking all the way from the visitors center, so plan to arrive early."
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,Big bend trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got started at about 10am and took our sweet time. It took about 3 hours of actively moving with several picture breaks between. There is quite a bit of shade so the heat really wasn’t too bad. If you don’t want to go all the way up, there were several good views less than a mile into hike. I would say we are moderately experienced and the only thing that’s tough about the hike is the last stretch of the switchbacks."
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,One of the best trail in big bend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the best trail in big bend park. The best time to take the trail is before sunrise but we took it in the afternoon as soon as we arrived at the park so we will not waste time and missed any place we wanna visit. Bring a lot of water and wear your best shoes.
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,Wonderful day hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a truly amazing hike! Parking is pretty limited so either go early or be patient & wait for a spot to open up if you are not staying in Chisos. We drove from Rio Grande Village & got there @ lunch time & were concerned about not getting a spot, but we waited about 5 mi. & someone got back & a spot opened up.  ITS WORTH THE WAIT."
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,Expansive views from the top,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was our favorite of the ones we did at Big Bend. It's moderately difficult, about 2.5 miles up and then the return for about 5 miles total. It was not usually steep, just consistent incline. At the very top the trail was mostly replaced by walking across open granite, but it was always obvious where to go."
Lost Mine Trail,5.0,Check the cloud coverage,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lost Mine Trail is a fantastic hike. During your time in Big Bend National Park it is an absolute must. However, if you go during busy (or even moderate) seasons be prepared for full parking lots and taking a hike just to get to the trail head. Parking is very limited, which in a way helps moderate the amount of foot traffic on the trail. Be prepared for an early start if you want close parking. My husband and I made the mistake of not checking the cloud coverage before embarking. It was very exciting to climb higher and higher into the clouds however it made for a very “gray” view from the top. Not that this was a disappointing view, however it also wasn’t the view we saw through travel guides. Also, don’t expect to see a mine when you get to the top. Look for an information board at the beginning of the trail which explains the name sake of the trail. "
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,Tame but Wonderful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Rail Trail is one of many bike trails that criss-cross the Cape.  Entirely flat (or nearly so), it runs for miles and offers stretches in sun & shade.  The number of people is down considerably due to a Covid, but people are good about slipping on masks when distancing isn’t possible.  If what you want is to spend a couple of hours in the outdoors without too much physical strain, the bike trail is perfect.  And if you plan so your rude ends by the Hit Chocolate Sparrow in Orleans, you’ll have a little piece of heaven."
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,Great trail ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The whole family loved the rail trail experience. We always felt safe with the two lanes and well lit street crossings. Bridges and tunnels to cross main roads. Gradual inclines and declines meant it was never strenuous. We went about 6 or 7 miles from Nickerson State Park west towards Brewster and beyond. Passed some lovely lakes if you want to take a break from the ride. Highly recommended as an off-season activity. 
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,Nice Walk on CCRT,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I rented a VRBO in Brewster MA that is one block off the Cape Cod Rail Trail (CCRT).  We walked about two miles one-way on the CCRT heading south/west.  We met many bikers on the trail, as well as several other walkers.  Very well maintained.  Not much foliage color change yet (as of 20 Oct 2021)."
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,Great experience with a Wine Slushie finish!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The CCRT is a don't miss if you are visiting the cape. We rented bikes in Dennis right off the trail and were on our way! it is very well maintained, easy to navigate and an beautiful enjoyable ride. I am not an avid bike rider but found this very doable. There are several road crossings, all well marked and the cars stop for bikers. I think depending on what time of year you go makes a difference on the scenery but it was nice and shaded with a good breeze which was great! Plus we love the First Crush Winery's turbo wine slushies, a must have in my opinion, and the winery is literally right off the trail (marked with a sign and a balloon!). Stopped for a little drink and snack and back on our way! loved it."
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,Great ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice ride through paved trails.  We ( myself  and boys aged 4 and 5) joined in Brewster and rode a couple of miles before returning.  Suitable for bikes with training wheels. Easy trail parking.  In the words of my 4 year old ‘me like this’.   Will be returning soon
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,The best rail trail I've ridden on,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I love to cycle and was really looking forward to exploring the Cape Cod Rail Trail.  Over the course of my weeklong vacation on the Cape this summer, I rode the entire length of the trail - one day I rode 50 miles.  It is well-maintained, cool and flat.  It's really a treasure and a model for other rail trails."
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,"Beautiful, peaceful, and easy ride",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a lovely, mostly flat ride through forested areas of the Cape (although it also crosses multiple roadways in multiple towns - but cars are very good about stopping for bikers on the path, so I wouldn’t worry if you have kids). We started at mile 0 in Dennis (at Barb’s Bike Shop, very nice) and went up to Nickerson State Park, stopping at JT’s Seafood in Brewster for clam chowder about halfway through. There’s a nice place to stop near Long Pond with benches and sand. "
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,Scenic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We rode around 15 miles and it’s mostly flat with beautiful scenery. You can easily rent bikes at the Dennis Cycle Center. They charge you at the end of your ride. You pass many gorgeous views and you can stop to take pictures. I would highly recommend to this anyone.
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,Great Ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We have ridden the entire trail, much of it multiple times.  On this occasion we began at Nickerson State park and rode to Yarmouth.  The scenery is generally good.  There are some road crossings which all have crosswalks and most have flashing lights.  I have to say that most people here are very good about stopping.  The trail gets fairly busy but most people follow the rules.  Like anywhere there are some who think they own the trail and ride like idiots.  The trail is fairly level which makes it good for families."
Cape Cod Rail Trail,4.5,Bike to see the Great White Sharks and Seals  hunting grounds!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Want to see seals and possibly sharks while on a bike trail? The Cape Cod Rail Trail  is a must when visiting cape cod! A wonderful way to explore the Cape, breathe in the salt air, capture some unique wildlife and perspective. The Trail is often shaded from the sun, and occupied enough that if you ever need help there is plenty of people willing to assist.Favorite part was reaching Wellfleet, beautiful surf and dunes. Here we often see the beautiful black harbor seals playing and feeding in the surf. Great white sharks can at times be seen patrolling close to shore, so do not swim if the seals are in the water to be on  the safe side.Also enjoyed watching the cormorants drying their wings along the wires..overlooking the tidal marshes.There are restrooms and restaurants along the trails, or pack a picnic lunch..Bring water. We rent bikes with baskets for ease and comfort, and the electric bikes are a life saver for long treks. For best nature and smooth seas to view seals, early morning and sunset are best!"
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Safety first,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although the trail is challenging and the views are spectacular, I cannot recommend this trail. There was too much loose gravel on extremely steep parts. And the dogs!  Ugh. Dog poo everywhere. Really disgusting and disappointing.  Many sections are single file and young people don’t seem to know manners. Descending the steep sections with a run is much easier and safer than with a walk (loose gravel) and ascending youngsters show no etiquette. Unfortunately I’m one and done. "
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Tom’s Thumb on ice!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Tom’s Thumb is slightly challenging trail mostly because the elevation gain during the first mile or so. This was our second time hiking Tom’s Thumb. This time we were met with something unexpected. ICE!!!!!!! The higher parts of the trail that remained in the shade were complete ice!!!!!! The other hikers seemed as surprised as we were. We took our time, enjoyed the views and managed to stay on our feet. This is a popular trail. Even midday during the week it was at least moderately busy. The views on the way up and especially at the top make this trail worth it."
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Great hike! Awesome views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hike! Be aware no water available at trailhead (although they have the nicest composting toilets I have ever seen). Also, there is a significant uphill climb and then it levels  off a bit. We went on to the Lookout which was nice because most people turn around at the thumb. Much less crowded and a GREAT view. Drawbacks: despite multiple signs instructing dog owners to pick up poop (“there is no poop fairy”) there was a significant amount of dog poop on the trail, some of it bagged (I don’t get it….)"
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Huff and Puff Hill,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What an adventure. Jack the guide at the begining of the trail gave us great information about the elevation and type of shoes needed.  There are two trails one easy and one with elevation.  Both are beautiful and Jack can give you information on which one is right for you.  
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Busy but beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved this hike! A beautiful trail with great views. We went on Thanksgiving Day so it was very busy, which was mostly an issue on the first section with the switchbacks. On the upper half the trail was wider and people were more spread out. Not rocky underfoot but quite a lot of loose gravel - was glad i had my hiking poles for the way down. Very windy at the top! But we found a nice sheltered spot to enjoy a snack and the views. Rated as ""hard"", but if you're coming from Alberta I'd say it's on the easy side of moderate."
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,"Great hike, good workout, beautiful views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Completed this hike in early Feb, was a great hike with spectacular views that seem to change as you go along. First half is defiantly a good walking workout that will get your heart pumping. Take lots of water as you will make drinking stops along the way both up and down. Bring yourself some snacks for when you hang out at the top and enjoy your accomplishment."
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Great hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Did the Tom's Thumb hike from the West side up and over to end up at the Tom's Thumb Trailhead.  Its a great workout through some beautiful high desert.  Going up the west side is great.  Coming down that side can be a little rough.  Definitely recommend the east side for your down hill.  Requires two cars but for a long hike its worth it.  Saw only two other people during the week and nobody after the first mile and half in.  Saw some deer and a rattle snake.  
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Great hike with lovely views the entire trail.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,In thirty days we hiked over 100 miles in the Phoenix area.  This was our favorite hike over Camel back and Picacho Peak.  Although not as challenging it's still a nice bit of uphill and the scenery is great.
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Challenging for the adults(50’s)-not for the age 20’s kids,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"50’s adult’s definitely used hiking poles. Bring plenty of water , we brought a backpack. We arrived around 7;15 and parking was fine. Took us about 1 1/2 hours there and an hour back. There are some athletes running the trail. Nice park worker there that took our picture."
Tom's Thumb Trailhead,5.0,Harder than expected,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I wasn’t expected this to be a harder hike, due to elevation rise, but it’s worth it! Great workout for the legs. We added a mile to our hike by checking out one of the side trails near the top. Ranger at trailhead to answer questions. Bathrooms there, but no running water. After descending, I got a sticker from the volunteer “ranger”!"
Grand Promenade,4.5,After Strolling Down Central Avenue - Must Do!!  :),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an easy walk on a beautiful wide brick paved sidewalk.  Lovely trees provide shade for most of the walk that can be accomplished in 30-45 minutes.  Time includes a slow pace and wondering off the path to take lots of pictures of the architecture on Central Avenue, explore the spring boxes, photograph nature and read many informational markers.  Highly Recommend!!!"
Grand Promenade,4.5,A Stroll Behind Bathhouse Row,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"A must when you're on Bathhouse Row. It's a half-mile stroll along a brick pavement behind the bathhouses, with several ""hot springs"" leaking across the walkway. Although it's shaded we were there on a day so hot that we cut the walk short. On a cooler day/evening, a romantic place to pass the time."
Grand Promenade,4.5,Don’t miss this,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We needed to walk off the pancakes that we had for breakfast, so we went down the street and walked the length of the promenade then returned to our starting point by walking down bathhouse row. Interesting historical information and fascinating natural features. So glad we didn’t miss this. "
Grand Promenade,4.5,What a delightful and comfortable walk - with much more available!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The brick-paved Promenade is beautiful and entirely enjoyable.  Many additional paved trails on varying levels are also available, with some stairways as well.  The trails are readily navigated due to several intersecting points, and good visibility.  Entirely worth the time spent, with fountains and cascading hot waters in some spots.  Occasional displays of historical information distributed about."
Grand Promenade,4.5,Nice little walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a nice walk away from the hustle and bustle of the main street and the bathhouses.  It is shaded for the most part and that made it more manageable for July. It would be nice if they added some things to stop and read along the way to maybe make it more informative.
Grand Promenade,4.5,Beautiful walk! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a beautiful scenic walk that goes behind the bathhouses. It was such a relaxing walk with lots of benches and even places to play chess. For the more adventurous you can take a side trail up to the top of the mountain and see the hot springs first hand. I knew they were hot but I didn't realize just how hot until I saw all the steam coming up from the springs! Be aware that this part of the walk/hike is pretty steep so if you have mobility issues don't even bother. The actual Promenade is only half a mile so not too long for an afternoon stroll....
Grand Promenade,4.5,"Very easy walk, paved level surface, steps at entry and exit only",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It isn't terribly long and there are enough places to sit along the walk if needed.  Unfortunately, we were there during a heat wave and I could have used a bit more shade.  It was very safe so a lovely evening stroll would be good too.  If you only do one walk in Hot Springs, make this the one."
Grand Promenade,4.5,Paved Pathway behind Bathhouse Row,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a .5 mile paved pathway behind Bathhouse Row.  There is a thermal fountain where you can actually touch the water.  We walked Bathhouse Row in 1 direction and Grand Promenade the other direction.  If you don't go in the bathhouses, it won't take you more than 2 hours.  We came around 8:30 am and parked in the free parking garage."
Grand Promenade,4.5,Nice to get up above and off Central Ave.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Access by stairs on either end, so there are no cars or bikes. Interesting plaques along the was detailing some history. Some shaded benches. The views are just OK - you get to see the backside and roofs of many of the bathhouses."
Grand Promenade,4.5,Relaxing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful Walk with lots of scenery.  It becomes clear as to why this was part of the health and recovery regime of the times.  Just a great place to either listen to nature on your walk or find a good tune and put your music while relaxing and taking in the sights
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,You must bring $10 cash and a pen,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"You turn up, find out you need $10 cash and a pen (to write your licence plate onto an envelope) to get in. You have $5 and no pen. Drive back to the Glen Ellen ATM. Someone’s card is left in it, so spend 5m finding the store manager to leave it with them. You’ve been  dispensed $20 bills, so back into the store for change. Cashier laughs because “this happens all the time”. Returning to the car park you realise you forgot to buy a pen. Luckily you dig around in your bag and find you had one all along. Pop the cash in the envelope into the slot (it would be impossible to remove envelopes stuffed in there using needle-nose pliers). "
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,An Inspiring and Beautiful Historic Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Whether you've read a little, a lot, or none of Jack London's more than 50 books and his extensive journalism, this state park is a beautiful and inspiring place to visit. The expertly curated museum and the London's homely cottage are engaging in any weather and miles of hiking trails lead to the Wolf House Ruins, Jack's famous ""Pig Palace"" and along or up the side of Sonoma Mountain through groves of Redwood and Oak. Before you set out, you may want to pack a deli lunch from the Glen Ellen Market or start the day with French pastries from the little bakery across Arnold Street. The $10 entry fees helps keep this park operating since it is one of California State Parks that is run by a non-profit foundation and receives little tax funding."
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,Wish we had more time,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got to the park an hour before the gates closed, so we did not have time to see everything, but the ranger at the gate kindly told us to start with the museum, and that would give us a little more time for walking around outdoors after the entrance and museum closed."
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,Avoid when hot,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived on a hot day, thinking the trees will provide cool shade to walk around. That didn't happen. We hardly managed to walk 5min to the cottage, that was closed due to Corona, and back. Within 10 min of entering the park we were on our way out, minus $10 entry fee. Oh well, lesson learned."
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,Wonderful insight into Jack London,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It costs $10 a car to enter the park.  Turn to the left, park your car and start with the museum, which was the home Charmian had built and lived in a few years after Jack died in 1916.  The ranger/gift shop person is purely ornamental and of no help whatsoever in directing you through the museum or park or answering questions correctly.  So, here’s the scoop:  The museum has all sorts of artifacts from London and a number of audio/video screens talking about different periods of his life.  Upstairs is Charmian’s bedroom, closet with some of her clothes and shoes, and bath plus more displays and her Steinway grand piano.  Once you are done with the museum (we spent over an hour), exit and go left to the path leading to the gravesite and Wolf House, the house Jack London built, but which burned before he and Charmian moved in.  If it is rainy (as it was when we were there), go back down to the parking lot and take the paved path on the left hand side.  The walk either way is about .5 to .75 mile.  Then you can either drive to the parking lot where the cottage and other ranch buildings are located or take a short walk there.  The day we were there, there wasn’t a docent for the 11 a.m. Wolf House tour, but we met Bern, a volunteer docent, on our way back to the parking lot and he graciously agreed to take us back to Wolf House and give us a tour.  He then was kind enough to drive us (it was raining) to the Cottage, where Bob gave us a tour.  Both gentlemen were more than kind, which made up for Miss Sourpuss in the museum.  We were there about 2.5 hours.  If the day had been nice, we could have spent another 45 minutes."
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,A beautiful place!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful place, especially for those who love Jack London! The historic site contains Jack London's museum, a cottage where he lived, the  magnificent  ruins of his ""dream house"" (it burned down when Jack London was about to move in), and his grave. All these are in the middle of a beautiful area (London described it in his novels) located in Sonoma Valley, with many great hikes available (not to mention the wine testing options!) My wife and I spent 4 days there, and it was one of the most relaxing and enjoyable experiences in our lives (I am not exaggerating!)"
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,Outdoor Adventures in a Historic Landscape,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoy stopping by this park when in the area to go for a hike or learn more about the life and accomplishments of the author, Jack London. It is amazing how many people no longer know who he was or what he did. This is a perfect place to be inspired by the ranch and wildlands that inspired him and to see hoe he and his equally adventurous wife lived. Some trails are very easy while others are a little  more of a challenge. Traffic during the day in wine tasting season can get to be a challenge so go early. There are wineries nearby you can enjoy after a hike or visit to one of the historic buildings and the town of Glen Ellen has nice options for food. The staff at the park are very knowledgeable and helpful. Give it a try!!!  Weather notes: although mostly mild, summers can be hot – spring is beautiful as is autumn though autumn traffic can be a challenge on weekends"
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,Jack London fan favorite!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The views were so scenic and beautiful.  We spent about two - three hours but did not hike the property or trails.  We visited the Museum and enjoyed the various displays. Shopped in the gift shop and purchased some biographies on Jack and his wife Charmain.  We then drove over to the upper parking lot to go and see the cottage. It was a little bit of a walk but very scenic.  We had a nice volunteer docent tour of the two cottage buildings residence/office and then the kitchen/dining room.
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,Very informative of Jack’s Life,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We stopped here and spent a morning walking around and learning about Jack London and his wife. The museum is in his late wife’s house with lots of information. You can take a short walk to see their house that they never had the chance to live in as it burned to the ground the day before they were going to move in. If the go to the right when you come in you can visit their other house they lived in and Jack wrote his stories.  There is a pretty hike to the lake through some redwoods.
Jack London State Historic Park,4.5,GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR A RELATIVELY SHORT OUTING,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wonderful trails for easy walks.  Only went towards the museum, Wolf House, and grave so don’t know if the other direction has more challenging treks.  Masks were required when passing others on trail.  There were those that didn’t wear masks but it was easy to step aside and get at least 6 ft separation when passing.  Loved that the park has nice signage which explains the history of the various sites."
Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,You get what you pay for.,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s free, so it’s worth about that much. The first 3 miles are fun and exciting, then it’s just the same thing for the next 8 miles. It might have been better if the car ahead of us didn’t drive 3-miles per hour for all of it. I’m not sure why they had to drive that slow as nothing changed for miles and miles. Some people apparently have nothing better to do than get in other people’s way. Anyway, have at least 2 hours to spare for this - maybe more if the jerk in front of you feels like driving slow. "
Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,Amazing getaway from the mass crowds. Beautiful refuge with loads of wildlife!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had such an amazing time at this experience! We decided the morning of to hop in the car and head over to this driving trail and hope to see some alligators up close from the safety from our car — this is exactly what we got on this trip.After a few days at a very packed Universal Studios - this was a great refuge to get away from the crowds and experience some REAL Florida! 
Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,Great for photographer’s and birders (It’s not Disney or a place to see “Dinosaur Birds”,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As noted on one of the reviews below, this area is not a zoo and may not be for some people. Just be aware before you drive out. "
Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,First visit & a memorable one,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Heard about this place several months ago from an article in the newspaper and ever since wanted to go. It was about an hour drive out of The Villages to this destination.  Found it easily. We brought a lunch due to the foreseen remoteness of the tour from what I read on the website. Made a fun weekend outing out of it.  We were met by tour guide just inside entrance and given a brief overview of what to expect  as first time visitors. We set out down on what would be an approximate 3-hour drive on an 11-mile long rock road that was well maintained. Plenty of pullover places to get off road and gander at the wildlife that was present. There were outhouses well spaced out along the route. Within the first 3 miles, we had two encounters with gators crossing the roadway which made the adrenalin flow. We followed along on the cell phone tour which gave us audible information on what we were seeing along the way. The trip was without any cost and was very fulfilling. I’d recommend it to anyone but suggest bringing food, sunscreen & plenty of water as there are no concessions on the property. There are places to ride bikes and hike if interested as well.  Great attraction and we feel privileged to have taken it in over Memorial Day weekend without any major congestion along the way."
Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,Great nature drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We really enjoyed our drive on the wildlife trail. It was busier than we expected as it was a perfect day for alligator viewing. We were there for the birds and we weren't disappointed.  As others have said it is only open Fri-Sun. There is a guide that you can listen to on your phone that explains the development of the area and how it is maintained. Kudos to those responsible for the development of this area.
Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,wow for wildlife viewing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was an amazing drive.  Its a bit tricky to get to - my older GPS had a bit of trouble finding it and had to backtrack.  First half was better for viewing - the right side of the car is where the action is.  Tons of gators and various birds.  I am excited to see it in the various seasons.  Drivers were respectful and plenty of pass points along the route.  The audio tour was about how they are cleaning up the pesticides and area, so informative.  Your car does get dusty as this is a gravel-like road. Best thing is that it is free."
Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,A hidden gem - one of our favourite Orlando activities - and it’s free,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Lake Apopka Wildlife Drive is a real hidden gem for visitors to Orlando. If you have a rental car I would strongly suggest you consider this. My boys and I did it and loved it. The drive is only open on Friday to Sunday and it’s free. It took us around 30 to 40 minutes to get there from our Orlando hotel. The wildlife on offer is abundant and we stopped counting the gator sightings after 50. Saw many species of turtles and amazing birdlife. The actual wildlife drive took around an hour. Watch out for gators before getting out of your car though.
Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,Alligators Galore!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well worth going. Teeming with wildlife, just drive slowly and keep your eyes open. We saw a lot of gators, around 50? Baby turtles, a turtle laying eggs. A lot of birds too. We arrived at 11 am, left around 1.30 pm."

Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail,5.0,Be sure to visit early!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As a photographer, I visit this conservation area a couple times a year. I thing it's the best place to phtograph Ospreys in the State. That said, you never know what else you may encounter. My very best shots of Painted Buntings were taken here. I know many people only look at the large birds, but the place is loaded with song birds. Hard to shoot I know, but worth it if you have patience. It gets busy so arrive early."
Navajo Trail,5.0,One of the Best Hikes in the Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My son and I hiked the Navajo Trail counterclockwise on our recent visit to Bryce Canyon.  The Navajo Trail begins near Sunset Point.  It is just under 1.5 miles long and it forms a loop that you can hike either clockwise or counterclockwise.  It can also be combined with Queen's Garden or Peekaboo Loop to make a longer much more challenging hike.  The Navajo Trail itself is not very long, but there is a lot of elevation change for the short trail.  The hike has an elevation change of around 500 feet into the canyon and then 500 feet back up.  There are switchbacks going both down and up whichever direction you hike it.  Do be aware that there are a lot of stones on the trail and you should have appropriate footwear so you do turn your ankle or get injured.  The sights on this trail are wonderful.  Thor's hammer rock formation as well as Wall Street are on this trail.  Additionally there are hoodoos all around as you hike the trail. The hike starts with good views down into the canyon and at the bottom it is very near a wash.  It is not all rock either, there are trees and plants on the hike as well.  I highly recommend a hike on Navajo Trail if you are healthy enough for it and you enjoy a good hike."
Navajo Trail,5.0,"Short, but not easy hike",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Don't be mislead by the short distance of this hike. It is a hike. You will walk down the switchbacks and you will walk back up the switchbacks. Those not used to the altitude and who are not in shape will struggle. But you'll have great views and get to walk amongst the rocks, so I think it's worth it!"
Navajo Trail,5.0,Every corner is a view!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We plan to do the ""Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop Combination Trail"". But we arrived Bryce around 2pm. and we parked our car near the visitor center. This original trail is too long, so we decided to just do the Navajo trail. The trail is soooooo fun!!! I mean literally fun. It is zigzag, you go down first, then go up. remember to look back when you are hiking, the view is always different. And we hiked around 4pm. the sun is going down. the lighting is just perfect."
Navajo Trail,5.0,Great Loop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked up the eastern side of the trail one afternoon from Queens Garden and came back the next day to do the loop. 
Navajo Trail,5.0,Variety of Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is such a great loop with different scenery at every turn. It's a relatively easy loop but delivers a ""sampler"" of canyon views. It has a zig-zag slot canyon, natural bridges, pine trees, hoodoos, vast vistas, and an array of critters! Just beautiful!  "
Navajo Trail,5.0,Beautiful trail which finds you down low with hoodoos towering above you!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We actually started on the Queen's trail which starts at Sunrise Point and connects with the Navajo trail in Queen Victoria's Garden.  Both are rated as moderate but make sure you are ready for the switchbacks on either end!  We went clockwise and headed up the right side of Navajo trail to make sure we saw Thor's Hammer and the Twin Bridges.  We rested at the top, ate lunch, then started down the left side of the Navajo trail to experience The Wall, where the hoodoos form a narrow area, again, with switchbacks.  We didn't go all the way to the bottom on this side but were so glad we got to see The Wall.  Loved this trail!  Keep in mind, what goes down, must come up!  We are 63 and 64 and managed all the switchbacks by taking our time."
Navajo Trail,5.0,great experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,It was an amazing hike going down the switchbacks on the trail. To look down into the canyon and see all the hikers along the path is a fun sight. It is steep going down and steep coming up but all very doable. Just take your time and take pictures along the way.
Navajo Trail,5.0,"Wall Street, the physical challenge of it, is the highlight",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The name obscures the highlight of the trail, Wall Street.  The trail is very steep, but well maintained with numerous steps.  You will see all manner of hikers and non-hikers huffing and puffing up (you can go down this trail but still have to come back up in elevation, so you might as well try to see Wall Street.  The other half of the loop ""features"" Two Bridges, but you would walk right by it unless you look back over your shoulder and up a crevasse.  A nice feature of the trail is that when you reach the bottom (or as you stand at the bottom coming from the other way, it is shady and you can cool off and rest.  You can also connect to Peekabo or over to Sunrise for a respite from the elevation."
Navajo Trail,5.0,Great Hike with Magnificent Scenery.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a wonderful loop hike which takes one from the top ear the scenic drive in Bryce Canyon down to the bottom and back up.  The hike is not itself long but it covers much of the most iconic and glorious scenery in Bryce and connects to other trails like the Queen's Garden Trail.  We did it in winter, when there was a fair amount of snow and ice and some trail areas in Bryce were closed, but it was beautiful and even though we did not have ""proper"" snow or hiking footwear with us, we had  no problems.   It is, as I said, not long or grueling, but is simply a very nice hike or walk through the sites of Bryce.  One gets right into the hoodoos and can see the Two Bridges as well."
Navajo Trail,5.0,Amazing views ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the most wonderful hike. Incredible views and took about an hour/an hour 30 minutes. It enables you to see hoodoos, but also travel downwards to see the rocks overhead. "
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,Stunning to say the least!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Both parking lots fill early so we went after 4pm since we had a late flight. We parked and paid the $5 fee (It's on your honor-but helps the state parks). We first did the Overlook trail to get a great perspective of Anchorage and the Cook Inlet. What a view!  We then did the Blueberry loop and a bit of the climb to the top. Unfortunately we just ran out of time and headed to the airport. This is a great place to spend a few hours and get great panoramic views of the surrounding Chugach mountains. Stunning to say the least!
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,May is still a bit early!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As it starts to warm up in Anchorage around May, I thought this trail would be an easy one. Was surprised to find slushy snow with patches of ice and mud in mid May. My regular hiking shoes, a thin jacket and gloves (not water proof) made the hike way more difficult than it is. The last couple of hundred feet were covered in soft snow that made getting to the top not only difficult but dangerous. Coming down was even more difficult as the soft snow and patches of ice and hidden loose rocks underneath made it slippery and dangerous. Regardless views starting from the first 100 feet made it all worthwhile. Highly recommended for novice to seasoned hikers. At the minimum the trail rating is moderate."
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,"Nice Trail, but wanted more blueberries ",4.0 of 5 bubbles,The views are beautiful from this trail. You get to see Anchorage and the Bay. Also around sunset time the scenery turns magical. 
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,See Denali on a Clear Day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were planning to hike the trail, but after seeing the views from the drive up and parking area, we decided not to as we were short of time and wanted to see a few more sites.  Lots of folks were hiking and it is a very popular trailhead.  We were fortunate to be there on a clear day and had awesome views of Denali and of Anchorage.  If it's a clear day, it is worth driving up just for the views even if you decide not to hike."
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,Fun hike for the family,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views from up here are breathtaking! Some trails closed off however, still very nice. Family was able to make it on top of the mountain which wasn’t easy climb given the rain, but the children loved the challenge! We still have one more week of exploring before heading back to Las Vegas. We looking forward to the glaciers and tunnels. "
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,Worthwhile trail but if you want to get to the summit the last half mile is challenging and basically a rock climb.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A popular trail about 30 mins drive from downtown. Plenty of parking. 
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,Strenuous Climb,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a strenuous trail with very steep switchbacks. We had rain and heavy wind at the top which made it unpleasant and blocked the views. We had good views on the way up. Definitely recommend trekking poles to save your knees on the way down. 
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,Not easy - quite steep,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike with kids ages (10,11,12,13) - though they had no problem with the incline others in our party would not have made it. We were unable to make it to top because of the rain and slick conditions but still a beautiful hike. Wish we had blue sky to see the views of Anchorage."
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,Hiking Options,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great hike that has something for all ability levels.  Some of our group hiked to the top and others did the short and less strenuous overlook trail.  It was nice to have a place where everyone could do something and enjoy the beauty of the area.  If you are in the Anchorage area, this is one you must see."
Flattop Mountain Trail,4.5,Challenging Hike!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail has great scenery.  However, to reach the summit you must be able to rock scramble for 900 feet.  Not for the faint-hearted.  It is well worth your time if you are very physically fit and not afraid of heights."
Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,Beautiful scenery!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were in a 4 wheel drive truck and were able to make it almost to the top; however, that last mile or so would have needed a shorter wheel base and higher clearance than we had, but still was so worth the trip! The views were breathtaking & we were at 11,280 ft elevation. It is not for the faint of heart however, because that road is narrow & no guard rails for peace of mind. I must say, sometimes, I said a little prayer! Great experience. Next time, we'll have a vehicle to make it all the way up."
Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,Beautiful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"With a 4-wheel drive vehicle you can see spectacular mountain vistas all around. There are a few technical driving opportunities, so we were glad we had rented a Jeep in-town. (High clearance 4 x 4 recommended)"
Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,Fantastic experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We took a tour with a local company (Alpine 4x4 tours) which is the way to go since this drive/road is not for the inexperienced driver.  If you have the right kind of vehicle and experience with rough rocky roads you'll love it.  View are wonderful.  Lots of history in the area I was not aware of until we took the tour.
Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,God's Country for sure!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Worth the visit. This was so beautiful. Make sure you stop and walk around the abandoned mine and look down the shaft. We stayed for about 30 minutes and the rushing water, fantastic views and sunshine made this place a core memory. Definitely worth taking a Jeep up there."
Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,Easily accessible by car,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited Yankee Boy Basin and Governors Basin on August 5th. I suspect it may have been better several weeks earlier. The wildflowers were mostly bloomed out. However, I'm writing this review so everyone is aware, you DO NOT NEED A JEEP or special vehicle to get to Yankee Boy Basin during this time of year. The road is well maintained with a parking area along the road about a half mile from the waterfall. I sure wish we hadn't paid for an overpriced jeep tour! While it would have been a lot longer hike to get to Governor's Basin, that was certainly not worth the jeep tour either.  Way more mining than wildflowers. If you hike at all, there are many areas more beautiful. Our tour guide was very enthusiastic about the increased mining activity of the past few years but as a nature lover, I'll go elsewhere in the future."
Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,We Dare to Drive thé Yankee Boy Basin with my mal 400,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really Dare to drive the Yankee Boy Basin Road Yankee Boy Basin Road, a great 4x4 trail located southwest of Ouray, in Colorado. The road is accessible from June until October. It's a 4.7 miles road and one of the highest mountain trail of Colorado. It climbs up to Yankee Boy Basin, an alpine basin in Ouray County, nestled at an elevation of 12,526ft. The road is really scary if you are afraid of heights. But absolutely gorgeous! "
Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,"Beautiful,  convenient/accessible",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went during a heavy traffic week,  so there was some necessary waiting or maneuvering on OHV trails but still had a great time.   The parking lot right above town is great,  we were able to do this trail,  not much of Governor Basin due to snow and not quite up to Imogene summit for the same reason.  But really was a nice experience and beautiful, well maintained area. Without snow you might still be able to do all three in a day,  but would be tight."

Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,"Spectacular Valley, but the roads have really been chewed up.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took one of the local services up to see the wild flowers and this year we hit at exactly the right time!  The basin is spectacular and there were an astonishing number of different types of flowers, and the area was just carpeted with them.  "
Yankee Boy Basin,5.0,Our Happy Place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For our family this place is nearly holy.  My dad died in this canyon, but due to his own mistakes, so we make this a pilgrimage of sorts.  Can’t even begin to count how many picnics we’ve had here.  It is well protected so the alpine tundra is spectacular.  The twin falls should look familiar to Coors drinkers.  It’s on every can.  The flowers change as summer progresses so there’s a new spectacular taking place every couple of weeks.  Hold onto your phones tho.  Once they’re in the river they’re gone forever!  Experience speaks!"
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Sad state of affairs,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is so much to blame for COVID, and maybe some of it has taken a toll on our National Arboretum, but the disrepair of the grounds looks to have been longer than 13 months.  With a budget of well more than $11,000,000 one should easily expect that the grounds would be tidy and neat and not look untouched from regular maintenance.  The Bonsai Garden is closed because of the virus, which was a disappointment, but understandable and it does not count to this review.  The state of disrepair in The Grove of  State Trees is embarrassing.  Dead branches, fallen trees and stumps litter the Grove.  Many of the trees are not identified, and are so sparse, it could be called anything but a grove.  The azaleas and magnolias were in full bloom and beautiful.  This is in a naturalized area, so no maintenance is not as obvious.  Signage is almost nonexistent and difficult to follow when it does appear.  Expectations for our National Arboretum should be reevaluated.  It is certainly a sad state for a US National Arboretum."
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Amazing experience!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went here during fall, the change of leaves is amazing, the museum has plenty of area to walk and enjoy a small picnic. The Bonsai exhibition is great to see, the main building was closed due to covid. The park has plenty area to enjoy with the family especially the columns in main area. No fee to enter."
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Acres of nature in the city,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Arboretum is a world away from the city, which is also its one drawback because you really need to drive to and through it.  However, it is worth the trip to see the many different areas and collections.  Personal favorites include the azaleas in bloom, herbs, bonsai, and Capitol Columns."
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Don't miss the Tulip Magnolias! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Tulip Magnolias were magnificent, and their scent was intoxicating! I wish I lived in the area so I could visit often to catch the various tree groves in bloom as Spring progresses. The original Capitol Columns monument was inspiring and solemn. "
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Their policies empower guards to presume you are up to no good,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Be forewarned that their policies empower security guards to track you down, presume you are doing something wrong, refuse to consider otherwise, and demand you to leave. Our family recently took family from Belgium there bc they heard it was among the top 10 sites to see. Sadly, a guard followed us to one of our favorite locations in the park, confronted and accused us of doing something we were not, and after walking back to his car, approached us from another path as we stood around talking and taking pics of each other and the pretty trees. He told us to leave, and we did because he was scary. A call to management resulted in our having to relive the whole nightmare with zero response though we were promised a phone call. We will never go back. What to avoid: wearing nice clothes (even though three of us were in jeans), taking pictures with a personal cell of family visiting a national treasure (oh, my bad, the guard told us it was “federal,” as if that justified his behavior or mattered in the moment). Read their permit page, which we did after we were kicked out, which will show you what you will also be accused of doing if you just happen to visit. Good luck!"
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,So much to see!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is so much to see at the National Arboretum. Great place for a long walk. We went during cherry blossom season, and though it doesn't have the concentration of cherry trees like the National Mall, it has so many varieties and through the guide on the app, we learned more about cherry trees and varieties than we ever had. The bonsai exhibit is nice as well. Would like to go back other times of the year to see what else is in bloom!"
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Beautiful gem in the middle of DC,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Love the Arboretum. It can get pretty crowded and you need to pay attention to the operating hours since they open late on some days. 
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Beautiful Oasis in the Spring and Fall,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's a bit away from all monuments on the National Mall, but you will be rewarded for the trip out to the Arboretum.  Best time is in springs when the azalea's are in bloom and fall, when colors are peak.  Make sure you make it to the Dogwood grove in the spring to enjoy the many varieties of dogwoods and the Asian gardens.  Both location will offer some solitude and views of the Anacostia."
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Not my first trip but I'm no expert on the place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I have difficulty keeping plants and it is hard to express how I feel witnessing a tree half my size that is six times my age. It is humbling in many ways. I love the Bonsai exhibit and you have to go before it's packed away for winter.
U.S. National Arboretum,4.5,Unexpected surprise: Loved the bonsais!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an unexpected surprise - a great surprise! We went in January 2020, with no crowds. DO NOT MISS the bonsai trees! Some are 200+ years old and truly amazing. Looking forward to a return trip when the plants are blooming!"
Stout Grove,5.0,Easy walk in the mighty Redwoods,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy trails, wonderful experience. We did a guided walk through with the river adventure guide. Just amazing, along with all the info and facts he pointed out we were surprised to  see wild ginger, wild bay leaf and other edible plants, but dont pick’em!"
Stout Grove,5.0,A most pleasant stroll through a beautiful grove,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Located in Jedediah Smith Redwood State Park, which is part of Redwood National and State Parks, the Stout Memorial Grove trail is a 0.6 mi/.97 km loop that takes you through part of the 44-acre grove of old growth redwoods.

Stout Grove,5.0,Fantastic grove of redwoods!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our family LOVED this grove of trees and the loop trail.  We visited on a cool clear day in late November.  We came from the North on Route 199 and turned left on to Fork Road, and then found the grove 3 miles down the road.  After our hike, we continued on down Howland Hill Road until we arrived at Crescent City.  Bathrooms were pretty disgusting/smelly.  Beautiful drive and trees!!"
Stout Grove,5.0,"Best Redwood grove, and great for families, short walking",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stout Grove was easily our favorite Grove of the ones we visited on our trip to the Redwoods.  It's a great grove for walking for families with little ones.  It's a short walk and you're immediately in the middle of colossal redwoods, and ferns.  Our kids had a field day climbing and walking on top of downed redwoods, and exploring the forest."
Stout Grove,5.0,Walk amongst giants!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great loop which takes you through a beautiful redwood grove. We got there by kayak, which was simply magical. The grove is full of never ending redwoods. Be sure and look at the roots on the trees, as they form their own art. It is truly magical and worth the trip."
Stout Grove,5.0,Our favorite part of Redwoods,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stout Grove was our favorite part of the Redwoods. The area needs a larger parking area but we didn't mind a little longer walk. The majesty of the trees with sunlight over head is amazing. Short, easy trail. Shows redwood roots also."
Stout Grove,5.0,Easy access to giants,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The road to Stout quickly immerses you in the forest and is a lot of fun.  The grove itself has lots of big trees, plus a number of fallen giants, so you get to see huge logs and root balls.  Currently, you must access the grove from Hiouchi end.  "
Stout Grove,5.0,Stunning,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Stout grove is advertised as a must see grove inside of Jedediah Smith national park. It’s an easy one mile stroll through magnificent coastal redwoods. Anybody can do this easy walk and the views are beyond stunning
Stout Grove,5.0,Beautiful but beware of entry,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Enter by way of 199 for only 7 minutes of potholes.  If you go the long way from Crescent City you will have 45 minutes of TERRIBLE POTHOLES.
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,Shenandoah National Park Mountains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Here you  will find the best views on top of mountains in the US East Coast. Fresh Air, Plenty of beautiful scenic views and panoramic, Rivers, Water Falls it has it all include natural wild life yes they have Bears and Mountain Loin. I was there and watch the sunset. They have great hiking trails and some spots you have to hike to but it also has area to can just drive to for everyone for the ones that hate hiking to the ones that love to be in the woods."
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,Amazing Hike and Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We started this hike from the Pinnacles overlook and then up Little Stony and Stony Man. A lot of uphill but the fall weather was beautiful and at 9am there were few people on the trail. Pretty crowded near Stony Man; near Skyland the AT is closed to getting around there on trails was difficult. Beautiful trails and views all around - worth the effort.
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,Nice hike - multiple starting locations - convenient to Skyland area,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"So this peak can apparently be reached via a few different trails (I think...).  We originally were considering starting from a trailhead along Skyline Drive but (after miraculously scoring one of a very limited # of parking spots) had to abandon that...  Instead, a bit later in the day, we started the ascent from a different trailhead not far from Skyland (on its approach road). "
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,Spectacular views await!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is considered an easy trail. Very near Skyland with a good parking area.
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,Great bang for your buck,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an awesome hike with beautiful views at the top that is not strenuous and doable for many hikers. The parking lot is right next to Skyland Lodge; if you are staying at Skyland, you could even walk there. I highly recommend going early. We hiked this on a Thursday morning in early Oct. We started around 9:15. An hour later when we finished the parking lot was 3/4 full and we saw a bunch of people heading up the trail. Meanwhile, we were able to get the summit totally to ourselves!"
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,Favorite!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is pretty steadily uphill with some flat spots along the way. However, any difficulty is well worth it! Not many hikes this short with this great of view. The hikers in my group ranged from 19-76 and we made it round trip in about an hour and a half. Definitely a must do if you’re in the park! Also a great hike across the road to some waterfalls worth checking out. "
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,our favorite hike in Shenandoah.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our favorite hike in the park. You get in a nice moderate hike with an incredible view at the end. we climbed out on the rocks and sat for over an hour while watching a bald eagle, a falcon, and other birds soar below us. "
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,"Nice View, Short Trek - Quick 'n Easy stop along Skyline Drive",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"An easy trek up to a summit and back.   Nothing terribly strenuous on this one, and at a shorter distance, was perfect for just a quick stop and view.   Well marked routes there and back, and it wasn't too crowded at all once we reached the summit."
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,"If time or energy is limited, be selective on which ""view"" hike to do",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the hikes that gives you a view of the mountains and valleys, and not a difficult hike no matter whether you park in Little Stony Man parking or Stony Man parking (the latter is a shorter hike to the viewpoint).  The sign at the trailhead near Little Stony Man parking and park literature don't agree on whether it is four miles or 2.6 miles to the rock formation.  I did not have my fitness watch on so I can't say, but it did not feel like or time like four miles.  There is a slope to the climb, naturally since you are ascending to a viewpoint, but it is not severe and can be readily accomodated.  There are numerous hikes in the park that emphasize the view.  While it is worthwhile, there is no need (other than fitness or checking off a list) to attain every outcropping with a viewpoint.  Decide how much time you have, what part of the park you will be in, and ask a ranger where the viewpoint(s) are in the area."
Stony Man Mountain Hike,5.0,Very pleasant hike with great views.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We enjoyed this hike on multiple occasions always admiring the views and the seasonal nature changes. The trail is not technically difficult . There are various options regarding starting points and it is good to look at the map first.
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,A hike even non-hikers would enjoy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I went with my husband to see the sunrise and it was one of the most calming experiences we have had together. I found the hike to be moderate as I am not an experienced  hiker at all. It is a steep incline the entire path and there are beautiful views throughout the entire climb to the top. There are plenty of safe places to stop for a quick breather, if needed. You are required to have a parking pass which there is a vending machine on site for that. There is also a restroom which I found convenient. I admittedly do not generally enjoy outdoor activities and this was a hike I enjoyed and would do again."
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,"Great view, loved it",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great view, short hike that is well worth your time. Beware that the trails are not marked well at all. Short but steep keep eye out for where others go up trail. Recommend marking location on phone once on top so yo7 can find way back to trail down."
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,Hike with a Big Payoff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Doe Mesa Trail is a great moderate hike with a big payoff - spectacular views.  We did this one with a private guide from Pink Jeep Tours; Mike guided us well and took plenty of pictures of us on our experience.  Got there around 8:30am on a Thursday and parking still available; only met a few other hikers.  Enjoyed the ""less crowded"" feel this hike gave. I would do this one again."
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,My Day Trip to Sedona,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I took a day trip to Sedona.  While there I went on a small group tour called the Best Vortex and Chakra Tour of Sedona.  This small group tour has a maximum of six travelers.  (My group only had two.). We visited two Vortexes.  One was a Buddhist site,  The other was Rachel's Knoll.  The tour involved some walking, sitting, and riding.  It included a chakra reading and gemstone.  We saw the mountains in the background."
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,35 min hike to great 360 views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Our mountain bike guide recommended this lesser known hike and I'm so glad he did.  It took 35 minutes with some climbing and at a decent pace to reach the top.  Doe is more of a mesa than a mountain.  The top is large and flat so you can get great views without crowds.  Highly recommend! 
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,Great views down into Sedona.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A great hike. Probably rated from easy to medium. One of the best views down into Sedona. Make sure you return on the road back to Sedona, not continue on as road turns into a terribly rough gravel."
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,Great climb in early afternoon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My adult daughter and I wanted to get Doe Mountain in on our recent visit to Sedona, but the only time we could fit it in to our schedule was in the early afternoon.   We hesitated given the heat but ended up being pleasantly surprised!   We started our climb at 1:30 and were the only people on the trail (needless to say, parking was not a problem).  There was plenty of shade along the way if we needed to stop.  And once we reached the top, there "
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,Moderate Uphill hike with views from the Mesa,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Did this 1.5 hr RT hike one late afternoon... not too many people and easy enough for our family, (one 68 yo)...it's uphill climb on a switchback trail, but you never feel unsafe.   Great views from the top mesa...leave 30 min to roam around and take pictures from both sides of the top.   Recommended as moderate hike."
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,Great first hike in Sedona.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Moderate trail that could be done quickly if one wanted... we spent a lot of time on top enjoying great views in all directions... plenty of parking available and easy to combo this with Fay Canyon like we did
Doe Mountain Trail,4.5,A “Doe” hike for sure!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not long in distance, but a vertical climb so could be challenging for some as there are a few rock scrambles along the way.  Good shoes are a must as slippery rocks and glad we had our hiking sticks as well.  However, the panoramic view at the top is worth the hike."
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,A “MUST” at RMNP,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely amazing! The photos don’t do it justice! You have to see it with your own eyes! We hiked it on June 23, 2020 and there was still some snow on the trail. The hike is easy to moderate at times. But my 3 and 6 year old managed it with several breaks so any healthy adult should be able to make it, too. My main suggestion: go early! After 8am the tailhead parking starts to fill up and you have to take a long bus ride. Also, if you get to Emerald Lake after 10am, it starts to get crowded, even with the COVID-19 reservation system in place. There’s only so many rocks to sit on and enjoy the views. Also, if you get there after noon, the sun angle is not as ideal for photos and you risk getting caught is afternoon storms. Enjoy this amazing beauty!"
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,"Gorgeous lakes, not too bad of a hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful lake hike, definitely recommend going all the way to Emerald if you're able because it is the most scenic. Dream Lake is also very pretty. I struggled with the elevation the whole week we spent in Colorado and the first uphill climb on the trail was a bit difficult due to that (we passed plenty of other people resting as well!). I would say this first section to Nymph lake was the toughest, and everything after was much easier. The trail was packed with snow after Dream Lake, but we did fine with just hiking boots (no spikes). You just have to be careful and take your time going up/down the snowbanks. We started around 9:30 or so and it wasn't too crowded but started to get busy on our descent. This is definitely a must do in the park and there's good reason why this trail is so popular."
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,Beautiful Hike But Go Early,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful hike. Rated as moderate and most reasonably fit individuals should be able to hike it without much difficulty. Starts at the Bear Lake Trailhead and includes Bear Lake, Nymph Lake, Dream Lake and Emerald lake. This is arguably the most popular hike in RMNP and can get quite busy which takes away some from the experience and is why I didn't give it the highest rating . Begin shortly after sunrise to avoid the crowds. The Bear Lake Trailhead still had plenty of parking spots at 730am on a Thursday morning in early September but was full by 7am on the Friday morning of Labor Day weekend even with entrance restrictions in place. Very easy to park in the Park and Ride and take the 15 min shuttle back and forth which runs every 10 minutes."
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,Icy trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We happened to come here after a cold front hit with snow and ice. The previous day was 90 degrees!! I can’t say I saw anything nice because it was so foggy but I still enjoyed the hike. Of course it was more difficult in the snow and ice but it was doable with poles. Loved seeing the Stellar’s Jay and the Black billed magpies. We were surprised how crowded the trail was...we arrived around 10am and people were still arriving at 1pm...parking lot was packed even with the weather. The other couple we were with found the trail too strenuous and went around bear trail lake instead. Five stars if I could’ve seen the pond. 
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,Beautiful scenery on moderately easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful hike! For me I’d say it was a moderately easy hike. I really enjoyed getting the see Nymph and Dream lake as well. It was raining lightly and misting pretty much the whole hike but they actually gave it something extra special. We went in late august and probably due to the rain it was a bit chilly. Although being a native Texan my idea of chilly compared to others might be different. Definitely needed a light jacket and am glad I chose pants instead of shorts! We did this hike at around 8-9 a.m. and it was too crowded. Loved it so much.
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,"Short ""Hike"" with Stunning Views",4.0 of 5 bubbles,What a beautiful hike with stunning views at the summit! 
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,Challenging Hike through Snow but Worth the View!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My friend and I visited in mid-May and the trails were almost 100% snow covered and also most of the lakes (Emerald, Dream, Nymph) were still pretty frozen. Hiking on snow on these steeply inclined trails was pretty challenging, but it made the trek worth it in the end. Even with how snowy the trails were, there were hundreds of people on these trails which did detract a bit from the overall peacefulness of the experience. We were also concerned there would be no parking since we arrived close to 12:30pm but we were lucky to find one of the last spots. If this was mid-May, I cannot imagine what this park is like in terms of crowds during the peak summer season. I personally would prefer less crowds so I am content with having gone during off-peak in May even if the lakes were still pretty solid, the trails were snow covered and the wildflowers and spring vegetation had not yet bloomed."
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,Beautiful Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent a few days hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park, and this was the best we encountered.  The trail begins at Bear Lake and proceeds mostly at a moderate climb to Nymph Lake, then Dream Lake then Emerald Lake.  Although it's not an easy trail by any means, we did see a lot of older and novice hikers taking it on, so any healthy individual should be able to complete the round trip even if you have to take a lot of rest stops.  The scenery is well worth the effort, especially around Emerald Lake.  As you trek along Dream Lake, look for cutthroat trout swimming along the shallow shoreline.  The total distance is about 3 1/2 miles roundtrip, so I'd commit a half day to this adventure so you can take your time and enjoy the beauty. Bring lots of water!"
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,"If you only take one hike, this should be the one!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This has been a favorite every time I visit RMNP since my childhood!  I took my husband and kids (ages 16/13/11/9) for the first time this summer and this was a standout to everyone.  We parked at the Park and Ride.  Hike is strenuous enough to feel like you are working without being too much.  Lots of snow on the ground this trip to hike on so bring a walking stick if you need a little more stability.  Kids thought the snow was so cool, and loved all the beautiful lakes on the hike.  Emerald Lake is stunning...the perfect crystal clear mountain lake.  Dream Lake is a spot on the way and could be your destination too if you wanted.  It is also magical.  But Emerald Lake is worth it to keep going!!  Beautiful vistas along the hike too.  Best hike in the park in my opinion...not to be missed."
Emerald Lake Trail,5.0,Amazing Hike and Scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were at the Park for half a day and did the perfect hike.  I would say that the difficulty was Easy to Intermediate and the roundtrip was 3.6 miles.  What was super nice about it was that at approximately every 1/2 mile there was a beautiful lake for us to see.  The first was Nymph lake, then Dream lake, and then Emerald lake.  And then alongside the lakes were magnificent mountain peaks."
Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,Great views but with a bit of a walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great trail but it’s harder than we thought!! The scenes that this phone captured were beautiful although the trek was very steep. The trail was probably a bit hard, but I think anyone would be able to do it. I think I’m exacerbating how hard the trail was. In truth, it’s a very scenic and beautiful trail that anyone should try. I mean, I even saw some families with 8 year olds doing it! PS: the final mile is a walk through snow and it gets pretty wind chilly at the top so I would recommend bringing a windbreaker and pants to put on."
Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,AWESOME!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Perhaps the most scenic hike in North America.  Stunning panoramic scenery the entire hike that doesn’t even look real.  The lake is beautiful - surrounded by thousand foot cliffs - and yes, it had icebergs in it.  I would highly recommend hiring a Glacier Park guide.  We used Lillian and she was highly informative and entertaining."
Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,"For Goodness Sake, Take The Boat",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very challenging hike on well marked up-up-up trail.   Spend the $ and take the boat to skip 2 miles at front and back of the hike.   Watch for horses , as they share the trail.   Saw a moose, and mountain goat (very far away).   Lots of company on this hike."
Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,fabulous  iceberg lake trail. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a fun hike. Took us a little over 2 hours to get to the Lake. The hike is in and out. Mostly continuous uphill to get there but it is relatively low incline. You first go through forest, then the side of the mountain. Wildflowers everywhere. It is a beautiful walk. There are several watery areas that you must cross. The last 1/2 mile is through snow. Trudging through snow is tiring. This is not a very hard hike. There is a small but fast running river that you must balance over 2 logs to get over. There is a very nice fall at the half way point about 2.6 mi point. Can take a small break there. Iceberg Lake is a must see! Incredibly beautiful. We arrive at the lake before 9am and there was only 2 other people. On our way back is mostly downhill. I would do this hike again!"
Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,A great day hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Iceberg Lake was one of my favorite day hikes I did during my 6-day stay at Glacier National Park in July 2006.  This hike was the highlight of the day, July 4th, capped off by fireworks in Kalispell.  The trail begins at the Swiftcurrent Motor Inn and gains a significant amount of elevation in its first 1/2 mile.  After the initial climb, the trail is a very gradual climb with breathtaking scenery.  Immediately, great views of the Swiftcurrent Valley are unfolded alongside beautiful wildflowers.  Next, the trail enters some forested areas before arriving at Ptarmigan Falls.  The waterfall is not easily visible from the trail, but you know it's there.  You cross Ptarmigan Creek just above the Falls.  Not long after the waterfall, the trail splits, left heads toward Iceberg Lake and right heads toward Ptarmigan Lake and Tunnel.  Ptarmigan Lake/Tunnel is a great side trip for those with more ambitious day hiking goals.  The Tunnel is particularly desirable, as it provides a breathtaking overlook to the Belly River Valley to  the North on its North side.  Continuing along the Iceberg Lake Trail, you exit the forest and the 3,000-foot cliffs surrounding the Iceberg Lake cirque come into view.  Here the open slops to the left and right of the trail provide great chances for spotting grizzlies, so keep on the lookout.  After some more climbing, you final crest a small ridge and get your first glimpse of the lake a couple hundred yards away...beautiful!  The icebergs remain floating in the lake through August.  It is a beautiful sight, and one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.  Being encompassed by 3000-foot cliffs on three sides is an amazing experience.  After spending an hour or two sitting along the shore or dipping your feet in the icy water, it's time to retrace your steps back down the trail.  In total the hike is 9 miles and gains 1,200 feet, making it a trail suitable for most day hikers.  This is definitely one of the best choices for a hike in Glacier and deserves special consideration.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,"A Lovely, Fairly Long but Somewhat Difficult Trail If You are Not Fit or Used to Altitude.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike has it all and its an easy one for avid hikers.   For casual visitors who are not fairly fit, it can be a challenge.  There is a steep climb when you first start out and then a long steady climb until you finally come to the lake. "
Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,"Relatively easy for GNP, with stunning views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Starts out steep, but don't let that scare you.  After the initial ascent the trail is fairly gentle.  You'll pass through several types of terrain, from alpine meadow to cedar and pine woods that smell amazing, with lots of beautiful views out across the glacier-dug valley.  There's quite a bit of water crossing the trail, as the peaks to the north are around 1500' above the trail and carry snow year-round in places, so bring some good hiking footwear.  Also bring your filter and fill your flask from the glacier meltwater!  In early September there were still a good bit of thimbleberries and huckleberries to snack on as well.  There's even a rather... rustic... pit toilet on a little spur about halfway to the lake."
Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,"A ""crown jewel"" of the park, as advertised.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trailhead is behind the Swiftcurrent Inn, in Many Glacier.  As available trail guides indicate, the only serious, strenuous climb is in the first 200 yards, so don't get discouraged.  The rest of the 5.0 miles is mainly gentle ups and downs (More ups since you have to go up about another 1100'.  We had no bear sightings, though the trail is rated A+ for griz.  Keep in mind that the bears do not subscribe to such ratings and are free to roam where they wish.  Apparently, they wished to be near the trail before our hike, and the next day when the trail was closed due to bear activity (The NPS wants you to see bears from a distance.  If they are close enough to harm you, or for you to annoy them, and the NPS is aware of it, they close the area).  Apparently, this trail is so A+ for griz that it experiences fairly frequent, temporary closures.  "
Iceberg Lake Trail,5.0,Non-Stop Views To Iceberg Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Iceberg Lake is a popular hiking destination, and the trail that gets you there adds to the experience.  The first part from the trailhead is through the trees, and has some quick moderate elevation gain - also some larger steps.  Then you break out of the trees into an open section that has great panoramic views of the surrounding valley and peaks.  Many of the hikers were stopping at Ptarmigan Falls for a break.  The last part of the trail has a meadows area, and a short ridge to hike over.  Once at the lake, there are many little trails that branch off - where you might find your own piece of the shoreline."

Bayshore Boulevard,4.5,Gasparilla Pirate Festival,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The City of Tampa has had a parade to celebrate the ""Friendly"" capture and sacking of the City of Tampa since 1904. The Famous Pirate Jose Gaspar and his motley crew sail into Tampa on a specially made pirate ship amid cannon fire and sword waving accompanied by a flotilla of privately owned Privateers and storm the city and the awaiting Mayor, demanding the surrender of Tampa and the Key to the City!  The confrontation takes place near the convention center, then moves to Bayshore boulevard where the Pirate Krewes march on the city, throwing trinkets and beads to the people lining the parade route. Think Pirate Mardi-Gras! the parade is free on the land side of Bayshore and can become very congested with as many as 200,000 people descending on the parade route. The water side of Bayshore is lined with bleachers and requires a fee of $45.00 per person to obtain a pass. If you hate crowds or if you have children with you and missed the children's parade held the week before you may give some thought to buying a pass, it is not as crowded and the children can get to the route barricade to receive beads and trinkets. The parade is more Family friendly at the beginning than at the end. Also for those people that want a more Adult parade a week after the Gasparilla Parade there is a night parade held in Ybor City.  All in all the Gasparilla Parade is a must for every aspiring Pirate! it is well run and the City and Event coordinators do a great job of making it as safe and orderly as possible, block off the last Saturday in January so you don't miss it!."

It was a weekday, so not as crowded as the week-end.  It was a sunny day and there was a breeze coming across the bay.  There is a nice view on both sides, with water on one side and majestic homes and high-rises on the other.  There are a few benches to sit on, but there isn't shade on the water side.We parked on the street on Lawn Avenue, which is near the south end of the boulevard.  There is not a charge to park, but probably fills up on the week-end."
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,Bee Hive Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I recommend that those that want to challenge their fear of heights, or those that have no fear of heights, try the Beehive Trail.  It's really not unsafe, but it will challenge you if you let it.  You will be rewarded with some pretty views.  I recommend patience, because you will run into a lot of people who are having a lot of different reactions to the trail: from youthful exuberance to downright tears.  Just don't rush anyone who is taking their time, and don't clog the trail taking a selfie on the edge, it holds everyone up."
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,Hike with our tweens,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a really fun hike with fantastic views. Our 10  & 12 year old girls loved it.  There were parts were they were nervous due the highest and the reach they had for the rungs but overall they enjoyed.  I probably wouldn't take anyone under 10. Not because they wouldn't enjoy the adventure but because the reach needed on the metal rungs could be too challenging.   We went around 10am and there was a pretty big crowd ahead of us so it isn't a fast hike as people need to take their time.   There is no turning around once you start, so you need to be committed.  If part of your group doesn't want to do, you can take the easy way up ( the bowl trail) and meet others at the top.   And ps- I wouldn't do with sneakers if your treads are not good!   Have fun!"
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,Scenic Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you take the Beehive Trail, be prepared to climb iron rings and maneuver yourself well. This hike is heavy on rock-climbing and, in some areas, is narrow and high up. Would not bring children and dogs up this route. However, you can still reach the top of Champlain Mountain via the Bowl trail, which is much easier (and is the way down if you take Beehive up). "
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,Hike with 10yr old,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiked the beehive this morning with my 10yr old daughter. She scampered up it with no problems. We made her wear my wife’s sneakers as they had better grip than her own. She loved it as it was the most challenging and rewarding hike she had done. I found the hike easy. I would have preferred to have hiking boots or sturdy walking shoes, but didn’t have them with me. So did it in my running shoes, which are lightweight with good grip and cushioning, but allow a lot of sideways movement. I didn’t roll an ankle but had a couple of moments when I thought I might!"
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,"Great hike, stunning views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We’ve hiked quite a few trails during our stay in Acadia and this one was by far the most scenic. The only thing I’d do differently is to go much, MUCH earlier to avoid a ton of people going at the same time. There was literally ‘traffic’ jam - having to wait for people to go up. The views were amazing. "
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,Who should climb ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is beautiful trail which requires one to climb  few, just a few metal rungs. But only 3 at a time. However, experienced climbers who were in front of me didn’t need them. A very short climb to the top. I wouldn’t take a five year old, but an athletic 10 year old can easily manage. Even I “jogged” to the top with ease. If you’re an adult, make sure you don’t have bad knees or shoulders. I did the hike with a sprained knee ligament and it didn’t act up and my sister in law climbed it with a compromised shoulder. So don’t fear this hike. "
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,Don't be scared!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a fun trail! The trailhead is right across the street from the Sand Beach parking lot. We went on a semi-crowded late morning/early afternoon and had to park a little ways down on the main road- it's a busy place! Wear sturdy hiking shoes and make sure you bring water. It's not a long hike at all, but you will exert a lot of energy."
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,"Beehive is a climing trail, not a hiking trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a hiking trail. It is a non-technical climbing trail. There is almost no place where you will walk on a straight path. The beginning of the trail starts with stepping from rock to rock.  You’ll need good shoes with a good grip, as the rocks can be slippery.  I saw one person go down and it seems she really banged her knee on one of the rocks.  Once you pass that section, you climb over large rocks and in some places are near the edge of the cliff (with handholds on the side of the cliff). It is definitely not a climb for those with a fear of heights or balance issues. It is also not a climb for young kids. You come down a different way- which is easier and you end up at a very pretty, scenic lake.  (Note: There are other trails that can get you to that lake as well.)  With all that said, all in all, we enjoyed climbing this trail and would do it again."
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,"Great fun, if not backed up...",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was super fun the 2nd time.  The first time was stuck waiting on a ledge for 20 mins for people ahead of us who'd frozen from fear.  We finally turned around before  and went back, which is not allowed.  Seriously, if you are scared of heights, this is not for you.  You really can fall to your death (probably won't) and even if you make it after massive delays because of fear, you've spoiled it for those behind you.  Of course, it's scary at points and of course it slows down as people are careful... but if this stuff freaks you out, don't do it.  It's a great experience when it flows.  The 2nd time I did it (at 5 pm) it was a blast... about 20 mins to the top, then the hike down the trail."
Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,5.0,"OK for brave beginners, but wear real hiking shoes!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I did this trail during Labor Day weekend with a group of friends and all of us enjoyed it a lot. The views along the way are definitely amazing. Maybe you’ll be a little scared of the height, but trust me, the view of the ocean and all those trees is worth it. We are not professional hikers, so this trail was a little challenging. We weren’t used to climbing on iron rungs like we had to. Sometimes we also had to climb rocks, but it wasn’t too hard. If I can give you advice, I’ll tell you to buy appropriate hiking shoes. Some of us were wearing inappropriate shoes and we had some issues, like slipping on the rocks. Another piece of advice that I’d give you, is to wear pants and not shorts, we ended up getting some rock burns during the climbing. Since the trail was pretty crowded and we took more time to finish it than planned, we decided to have lunch on the summit, which was a great idea, because we could spend more time admiring the beautiful view, so if you have the chance, you can do the same. The trail back to the bottom is pretty easy and well marked, so you probably won’t have any trouble on the way back."
Lanikai Pillbox Trail,4.5,Challenging Hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family, my husband and my young adult son, attempted to do this hike on a Wednesday in late June. As lucky as we were to get parking there near the trail head we didn’t get very far for a variety of reasons. The trail is as many people said rather steep and narrow and you really do have to watch where you step. We only made it to the first lookout, not even to  a pillbox because we do not feel confident in going further. My son wanted to continue but we discouraged him! But as others have commented there are people hiking this in sandals and as we exited  we saw a  young woman head  into the trail with her dog. We’re not the most experienced hikers but we didn’t think it would be as challenging as it was!"
Lanikai Pillbox Trail,4.5,Popular hike for a reason,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I love this hike so much. For relatively little effort, you are rewarded with stunning 360 degree views quickly and then continue along a ridge for seemingly as long as you want (we kept going past all the pillboxes for quite a while, and the trail didn't seem to end). The views are some of my favorite on the island. It does tend to get crowded and hot, so go early for the most pleasant experience. Bring good sneakers or hiking boots! While it's easier than the other ridge hikes we did on the island, it's still not easy, and sandals aren't going to cut it. There are some steep sections to navigate in the beginning, so take your time."
Lanikai Pillbox Trail,4.5,They will Tow you! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We just parked at the beach down the street about a 10 min walk. The hike isn’t bad just a lot of loose rocks so be careful. Several views stopped along the way. Don’t know how people climb at sunrise not being able to see anything
Lanikai Pillbox Trail,4.5,Great hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hike to do to start off your vacation in Oahu!! I have some experience hiking, am active, and loved every part of this hike! Definitely recommend wearing hiking boots or something with grip - not sneakers, because there are some steeper parts. There aren't many places to hold or hoist your body up besides rocks. The views at the top are stunning and so worth it! Enjoy!"
Lanikai Pillbox Trail,4.5,Beautiful view. Great workout.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did the long route. Terrific viewpoints along the way. Have to make sure you watch your step, many places along the way are more like bouldering than hiking. Recent rains made someplace damp but it wasn't slippery at all. Just have to be careful with your footwork. Terrific workout, we finished up with a dip in the Pacific at lanikai Beach. Be sure to take extra water and protect yourself against the sun. You won't be disappointed with the sites along the way."
Lanikai Pillbox Trail,4.5,The Views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Came here on a Saturday morning. The hike isn't hard at all. If you dont stop until the last pillbox, it'll only take you 35 mins. We got to the top in 38 mins. Great vista points to stop at along the way. Probably the best views in Oahu, along with Diamond Head. You'll have to park about a half mile away, on the street. Make sure to wear trail shoes, hiking shoes, or sneakers with good traction. Slippery at certain parts eith loose rocks & dirt. It also rained for a few minutes on our way down, so maybe bring a poncho. Come early in the morning or deal with crowds like we did."
Lanikai Pillbox Trail,4.5,Challenging but rewarding hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Rough hike with rewarding views - be sure to wear sturdy hiking shoes for a steep climb up with rocky terrain.  There are beautiful views of the ocean and landscape below when you hike along the top when you reach the pillboxes.  We stopped after the first two pillboxes which are cement blocks that are open & covered in colorful graffiti.   You can climb on top of the pillboxes to have the highest views.  Be careful though as there are no guardrails & can get quite windy at the top.  The climb down was more difficult but faster.  It took us about 2 hours to do the hike round trip but did not do the entire hike - just to the second pillbox.
Lanikai Pillbox Trail,4.5,Must do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We loved the pillbox hike. It was pretty easy. Some state slopes so you have to be careful. There is not good parking so you may have to park somewhere downtown and walk to the trail head. The views are great. The pillboxes are really cool but the pink pillbox is actually on the other side of the island if that’s what you’re looking for. It probably takes about 30 minutes or less to get to the topBut we took longer to stop and enjoy the views. You will definitely get out of breath if you go when it is very hot so I would say this for sunrise or sunset. Sunrise is better as sunset on the other side of the island.

Ousel Falls Trail,5.0,Pretty Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Ousel Falls Trail is a short 1.8 mile mostly paved hike on the outskirts of Big Sky Village in Montana. The hike is pretty and features a path that meanders along a stream ending at the Ousel Falls. Having seen some large waterfalls prior to this hike, the falls themselves were a little underwhelming. But the hike was still enjoyable and worth doing. It is easily accessible and can be done by people of virtually any ability level.  Its location near Big Sky makes it very accessible and easy to get to."

The cave area should be avoided at mid to high tides but viewing from the upper area is great then. Parking can get crazy in the summer on weekends. Great for winter storm brewing. See Cape Foulweather while you're there. "
Devils Punchbowl State Natural Area,4.5,Nice Experience,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This stop was on my list of must sees. If you are coming from Newport then there is a sign off Coastal Highway 101. Once you make the turn there is not another sign so it’s easy to drive past. There is a sign coming from the opposite direction. Coming from Newport just remember to turn at the sign for MO’s Restaurant. The punch bowl was something to marvel and for those brave souls one can venture inside.
Devils Punchbowl State Natural Area,4.5,Spectacular in winter!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"While we have visited this area several times before, this was the first visit in winter. It was spectacular! The ocean was wild and provided a much more interesting action background for viewing. Seeing Devil's Punchbowl is always fun, but be sure to walk all around the area including the stairs that take you down to Beverly Beach. Awesome!"
Devils Punchbowl State Natural Area,4.5,Amazing! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an incredible experience. I went a little too late and the tide was starting to come in, but if you came right at low tide you could walk all the way in and spend a lot of time down there. It’s so beautiful. There’s also a lot of tide pools to go look in. "
Devils Punchbowl State Natural Area,4.5,Cool to look at,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went on a very cold blustery foggy day.  They have the area fenced off, but you can look down into the punchbowl.  We went between low and high tide, so you could look down into the bowl.  The area itself has some pretty views and lots of surfers nearby."
Devils Punchbowl State Natural Area,4.5,Huge Hole - No Fees,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"During our Oregon Coast drive, we stopped at the Devil's Punchbowl for a quick visit.  When we came on Tuesday 7/27 in the morning, it was low tide and there was no water in the hole.  We even saw some people inside.  Parking was easy and it was a short walk to the viewpoint.  No fees to enter."
Highline Trail,5.0,Must Do Trail in Glacier ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a very popular trail in Glacier NP. It is about three miles round trip and can be a bit strenuous due to some elevation. It is just behind the visitors center. Be aware of bears as there are warning signs everywhere. Views are iconic. Parking is very challenging but we were fortunate to find something pretty easy in a very full lot around 11 am. Just be patient and wait for someone to leave. 
Highline Trail,5.0,"Awesome views, but overrated",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this on an absolutely beautiful day - great weather and we were excited to finish our week on a high note.  We weren't all that impressed considering the great reviews.  Since the buses weren't running, we went about 4 miles in and turned around, but I don't think we missed much.  In normal circumstances, you can hike to the Loop from Logan, but the reviews on the last 4-5 miles on that didn't sound great either.  The views are amazing - absolutely.  But the views don't change much throughout the route so it's just a lot of walking with lots of other people.  Compared to other options at GNP (we much preferred Avalanche Lake and St. Mary's/Victoria Falls earlier in the week), I'd choose something else, or just go 2 miles in and turnaround to get the most out of your time rather than invest a full day."
Highline Trail,5.0,WILD!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is crazy fun, very narrow in parts with a steep drop off, not for the faint of heart, especially since it can get a little windy.  Park at Logan's Pass - take your time finding a spot, people are always leaving you just need to be patient.  Fun trail, different where you have to hold on to a garden house that's affixed to the wall for you to hold as you traverse the narrow high line passage to get to the other side of the trail.  You can do just 2 miles of it and still love it. "
Highline Trail,5.0,Go early!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"How beautiful!  This is a great trail, but like so many in Glacier, you must go early.  We got to Logan Pass at 7:10 AM and got one of the few remaining parking spaces.  To facilitate this, if you’re staying in St Mary you will be far closer to Logan Pass than if you stay in West Glacier, Columbia Falls or Whitefish.  By going early you also get the benefit of hiking in the morning sun, and watching the light change as it dances on the mountains.  When you return to Logan Pass, cars will be circling looking to take your spot!"
Highline Trail,5.0,Don’t go if it’s foggy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We wanted to go on this trail for the views but ended up sitting in the car all morning waiting for the fog to lift. With low clouds and fog you will get no view whatsoever. When it cleared we hiked the first mile or so which has the best views and they’re spectacular! The hike is not strenuous but if you’re nervous about heights you will not be happy here. The trial is so narrow in places you’ll have to go single file while holding onto a cable bolted to the side of the cliff. You’ll look out over the road below across the mountains to the horizon. Highly recommended! 
Highline Trail,5.0,Unique trail with wide views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Much of this trail is along a ridge line allowing wide and distant views. It’s moderately difficult with lots of rocky areas. It’s just off the Logan Pass visitor center parking lot. We saw a few mountain goats right off the trail 
Highline Trail,5.0,Magnificent Hike from Logan’s Pass to Granite Park Chalet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked the Highline Trail from Logan’s Pass to Granite Park Chalet. I used the Loop Trail to hike out to the Going-to-the-Sun Road for about 12 miles of total hiking. The Highline Trail runs along the Garden Wall with stunning views at every turn. Wildflowers were blooming everywhere along the trail and hillsides. The trail is pretty exposed along most of it’s length so bug spray and sunscreen are musts. I also had to cross two snow fields even in July. The trail is strenuous in some spots but not for long distances. There was tons of wildlife along the trail including mountain goats, marmots, and pikas. The one downside was the Loop Trail was extremely strenuous to descend compared to the Highline Trail itself. That is something to take into account when hiking from Logan Pass to the Loop as I did."
Highline Trail,5.0,Best (difficult) hike to-do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked from Logan Pass to the side-track to Grinnell Glacier Overlook, then to the Chalet, and ending at The Loop parking lot (shuttle bus stop); total 14 miles, definitely strenuous hiking! The best trail out there, but be ready to experience elevation gain. Especially after 7 miles when you do the Grinnell Glacier overlook, it's ""only"" 0.8 miles uphill, however extremely steep, but the view is extraordinary. Two days later we did the Grinnell Glacier hike from Many Glacier, and it is great to see where you went. This is a one-way hike we did, so we bought tickets to get on the shuttle bus at The Loop. Do not underestimate the length and difficulty of this hike; the last 4 miles we did from the Chalet to The Loop is all downhill, and very challenging for your knees."
Highline Trail,5.0,Simply Amazing!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved this trail!  Up way before dawn to make the trip to Logan Pass and secure a parking spot.  Hubby and I are 57 and 59-we had only planned on going to Haystack Butte, but fell in love with the trail and ended up hiking the entire trail! The views were simply amazing!! We had read about how unpleasant the last 4 miles are-all downhill and no shade.  Definitely harder on the knees, but we actually enjoyed it.   We were concerned about the possible wait time for the shuttle at The Loop. We ended up waiting about 35 minutes.  We heard from others that their wait times were much longer."
Highline Trail,5.0,One of the best hikes in North America,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a five star attraction with two huge caveats.   One, and most importantly, the first quarter mile is quite scary.   There is a huge drop-off with only a railing on the other side to hold onto.  It's very safe but not for everyone.   Second, getting there and back is a total hassle.  Budget at least 90-120 minutes each way.  If you get there at 7 AM and have a GTTS pass.  You're all set.  For the rest of us, there is a very poor shuttle system or taking a chance on parking.   That said, once you get out there the experience and the views are unbeatable.   It's tought to get there given the weather conditions, etc.   "
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,Sleeping Giant will wake you up,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Short hike that will get your heart pumping! Climb 1247 ft elevation in 1.8 miles. Only a few areas that were difficult to maneuver and was more like rock climbing. Great little picnic shelter almost to the top. Could be tough if it had recently rained and made slippery.  65 years old and I did it with hiking poles which made the downhill easier on the knees so o would recommend using them if you are of a more mature age lol.
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,would not recommend,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"we stayed in poipu and this was an easy drive to the trailhead. we went a few days after rain, but were in no way prepared for the condition of this ""hike"". reading this trail being described as muddy is laughable, and completely inaccurate. most of the trail looks like a water pipe, with two banks of mud on either side and muddy water in the middle for you to slosh through. it's not a hard hike by any means, but it's not a hike really at all. the views were good, but definitely not worth it. i even told a few people when we got back to the lot that it wasn't worth it."
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,No One Sleeping Here,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My daughter and I decided to hike the out and back trail before dinner on a Wednesday afternoon. Weather looked favorable so we gave it a go. The first part of the trail is the steepest for the shortest distance, it levels out a bit afterwards, even though thete were plenty of twists, turns, steps, climbs and some bouldering closer to the top. Beautiful views at almost every look out area. There is a bit of a false top, with a picnic table and shelter, but if you keep trekking a but further, you get the true top and amazing views. The cave at the top is a welcome cool temperature. It took us about 3 hours total but it can be done in less if you are moving at a faster pace. Absolutely a must for the adventurous."
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,"Great hike, mid-range challenging, if you are a hiker you’ve got it!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Solid three mile round trip hike.  If you are a regular hiker and are familiar with hills and a little bit of mud (there is not too much mud) you will do fine. We hike regularly in Western NY and the ADK Mountains and this was more like a Finger Lakes Trail than an ADK mountain.  It is about three miles round trip and you gain about 1,000 feet of elevation on the hike up; there are lots of switchbacks though so you don’t fell the elevation gain as much.  Lots of pretty views on the way up and at the top.  Took us about 2.5 hours at a leisurely pace.  Nice hike to stop at if going between the north and south ends of the island.  And of course once you do the hike you can’t miss the Sleeping Giant every time you pass it on the highway, in fact you keep seeing it clearer and clearer!"
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,Don't Wake the Giant,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are spectacular views from this trail, but there is a cost.  The trail is not very well maintained with deep ruts, steep terrain and numerous roots to catch your boots.  This trail would be very difficult after a rain, when it's muddy.  We were caught unawares of a near vertical rock face, about 15 feet high, that required some scrambling to surmount.   This was quite challenging for some, especially for those 70+ years of age.  I would do this again, but would be better prepared with hiking poles.  We did not get to the top due to steep terrain."
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,Highly recommend!! Beautiful mountain top views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Moderate level hike with gorgeous views!! We finished in just under 2 hours, including taking pictures at the top and a few very short water breaks.  A couple areas are more like rock climbing and could be difficult for someone that doesn’t get around well or has a fear of heights. We are 41-51 age range and “fittish” and didn’t have any issues. I would not recommend taking small children to the very top."
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,"Moderate hike, Great Views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,The two mile East trail is easy to follow and has parts that are muddy and it hadn't rained in a few days. After a rain it would be fairly muddy and slick. We are in our sixties and had to no issues. At the top you get an excellent view of entire area.
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,"Go Early, amazing views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved this hike! There are some spots that are pretty muddy, so go early before they get really bad (and so you find a place to park!). It took my husband and I about 2 hours (mid-30’s) and found it to be an easy walk/hike. Views from the Giant’s Forehead were amazing and really did feel like we were on top of the world!"
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,Great views of Kapa'a,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Parking is a little tight and the navigator does know where the trail head is.  The hike to the picnic table is 1.7 miles uphill with a couple rocky scrambles.  If you walk another ten minutes you can hike to the top and stand on the precipice.  We didn't because of the heat and our water bottles were empty.  
Sleeping Giant Trail,4.5,Sleeping Giant East Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a fun, moderate trail with a little bit of scrambling in just a couple places. The place we were staying was closer to the East Trail, so that’s the route we took. There is a small parking lot. "
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,NO Face Masks or Social Distancing,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"PLEASE respect fellow visitors & WEAR a face mask! I started walking this path early this morning and spent an hour on the trail, and NO ONE was wearing a mask! It's easy enough to carry a mask in your hand or pocket and briefly cover your face with it when you see someone approaching you on the trail, then you can remove it. In addition, the majority of the boat docks have been removed from the water in preparation for winter.  They are being stored in the small green space between the edge of the lake shore and the path. This drastically decreases the width of path, in many sections only 2 feet wide, making it impossible to social distance. Under normal circumstances, this is beautiful path to walk, I just ask that people be respectful and curiosity of other's safety."
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,Public path through private land,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"At 21 miles long, a professional marathoner could knock this trail out in 2-3 hours. Most people, us included,  choose to take our time and hike a segment or two at a time. We also took the mail boat cruise and watched the mail jumper run a half mile or so of the    path at near marathon speed to deliver to addresses where the lake was too shallow and docks too close for the boat to  navigate. Each portion of the circuit is different because each land owner along the way is responsible to maintain their portion of the path. There are several other extended hiking trails in the area to explore including John Muir, Emma Carlin, Ice Age, and a little farther and a whole lot longer, the North Country.  Explore and have fun!"
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,September Trek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not ready to do the full hike around the lake, we hopped on the Lake Geneva Cruise Line to cross the lake and then walked the 10 miles back along the Lake Shore Path.  The walk provides unique views of stunning homes and landscaping as well as Lake Geneva.  Part of the fun is also the variety of trail types--everything from dirt and grass paths to concrete and brick pavers.  A fun activity for a warm fall day."
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,Shore Path May 2023,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I started at the George William campus at Williams Bay. In reading other reviews the south side of Geneva Lake is rugged with uneven surface and more steps up/down. We left at 7am and finished at 5:30pm with a lunch picnic and brief stops every 2 hours. We are 58 and 59 and took our dog on a lease. Taking the dog slowed us a bit, however our 15 month dog is full of energy and waded in the lake two times to cool off. I will repeat that the LG country club steers you to Woodland road or drive. The signage for the path is there, however, this half mile or so is NOT on the lakeshore, it is residential and you walk across a bridge and across a driveway. If we did it again, I would hug the lakeshore at this spot. Beautiful day, we used the only official open rest room facility in downtown LG. I downloaded the app from the LG visitor web-site. It was free. The estates and heavily wooded parts of the path were my favorite. We took backpacks with snacks and water. The trail has significant pedestrian traffic the mile before and after LG,  Wear good walking shoes! Gnats were everywhere unless there was a breeze. "
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,So many things to see as you walk!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We ran out of time & were unable to go as far as we wanted around the lake.  So, so glad for the wise forefathers in this area who set aside 20’ of public access walking!!!  You will find many different types of pavement as you follow the path: gravel, cement, bricks, & we even encountered a very well-laid out ceramic tile sidewalk.  We loved seeing so many beautiful homes, lawns, flowers, & being so near the lake.  The path meanders a bit, so enjoy yourself.  I’d advise good walking shoes for safety.  Oh, & there aren’t very many “exits”, so be sure to bring your own water bottle & use your facilities BEFORE starting out.  "
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,Relaxing walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"People talked a lot about the path that goes behind the lake homes, but the part of the path I liked best was the main area near downtown. I walked about a mile down through the lake house properties, and yes the homes are gorgeous but part of me felt I was invading home owners' privacy, weirdly. Path is narrow and sometimes it right up to a house or backyard. Dogs are allowed on the path so I could see it being a fun adventure for the pups."
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,Take a hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love the shore path around the Geneva Lake.  Our teenage daughter hiked the entire 22 miles of shoreline.  It took her about 7-8 hours.  My husband hiked the south shore with her, and I hiked the north shore with her.  If you do it, take lots of water, sandwiches or snacks, and wear hiking shoes or boots that are very comfortable.  Many estates have paved or stone paths, some have stones to walk on, and others simply have a pathway that is indented by previous hikers.  Some places can be muddy and slippery if it has rained recently.  You don't have to hike the entire lake in a day.  You can do sections on different days.  It's a lovely way to get close to the beautiful estates and to enjoy the fresh air and lovely views of the lake."
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,Early Morning Tranquility,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Prior to an all-day business meeting, I walked the Lake Shore Path near Linn for about 40 minutes (20 minutes out and 20 back). I saw only three other people, and two were working on the estates. The water lapping the shore was tranquil, the morning was sunny and the water, a deep blue. The path was clearly marked even as it varied from property to property. I only wished I had had more time! Another trip…"
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,Lake Geneva walking trail.  Funnnnb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Peaceful, beautiful walk on the Lake Geneva lake trail. It’s very cool the trail has open rights to go around the lake. Yes you go over peoples property, and please respect their property. It is probably too much for one day so walk it over several days. You can arrange a boat pickup to take you back to your starting point.  Very fun"
Geneva Lake Shore Path,4.5,Lame and small lake ,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The lake was very small/crowded, hard to find parking... too many people just sitting and staring at the lake. The beach area was very tiny, not sure why there's a hype about this area... there's nothing special here it's very far and very lame and boring ...most people who live here are old white people who are very boring and have nothing fun going on here. They don't have that many restaurants either and their bakeries closed too soon. The boat rides also were booked and closed for the day. The water was dirty and smelly"
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Breathtaking!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to take an afternoon away from our Phoenix hotel and drive a portion of the Apache Trail one March afternoon.  It was a decision we were glad we made. The mountains, cactus and lake vistas were beautiful. We stopped at the ghost town to start our drive and found it to be a lot of fun.  We made it to Canyon Lake, which was gorgeous, before turning around to drive back to Phoenix.  Next time, we will allow more time so that we can drive more of the trail.  It was really a surprising change from the city and one that we found just breathtaking."
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Fantastic drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous drive. Stopped en route to take a look at pretty Canyon Lake, and at Tortilla Flat for an ice cream. Tortilla Flat is tiny and very touristy - it was busy on the day we were there. The best part of the drive was the next two miles past Tortilla Flat. Just a little way past where the pavement ends there's a parking lot, and from this point on the road is closed right now. But there's a short paved path from the parking lot to some outstanding views of the Superstition Mountains. You can continue to wander for a bit past the end of the paved trail. Really beautiful. We saw a tarantula which was pretty cool. Would love to come back and do some hiking."
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Scenic!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Scenic drive, lovely scenery but we could only go from Gold Mine Town up to Tortilla Flats, couldn't drive all the way since some sections were closed due to some flooding. Would definitely drive it again once all the sections are open which won't probably happen until 2024. The shorter drive was still worth it, though!"
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to take a drive to Tortilla Flat on the Apache Trail.  The drive is a little scary with windy roads and one lane bridges, but it is so worth the views.  The Canyon Lake Vista was beautiful.  Tortilla Flat is a little disappointing, pretty much a  souvenir stop and a place to eat.  We didn't opt to go off the pavement to see the next 9 miles that were open.  We were out early morning and glad we were since it started to get very busy by the time we left.  There are a lot of motorcycles so early is better."
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Gorgeous mountains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Traveling from Phoenix/Apache Junction, even if you only go to the end of the paved section a few miles past Tortilla Flats, you'll see stunning mountain scenery. No gas stations and limited facilities, so be prepared, including water in summer. My personal recommendation is to take only your tow vehicle/toad - steep grades and hairpin turns. But you won't regret it."
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Real Surprise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I bought a 911 in California and was driving back cross country. Visited in Phoenix waiting for my son to fly in. Took a random drive and decided from the map it looked fun. Gold Mine, desert mountains, curves, top down!  All of a sudden, Canyon lake. Mouth fell open!  Wasn’t expecting a lake.Went past it up winding mountain road. Views crazy. Paved road ended at area of recent wild fire. Went back to tortilla flat for beer and music.On the way back did gold mine. Did again the next day. Saw 30+ Ferraris the next day. Rate 100/10."
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Arizona Trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a beautiful drive through the Superstition Mountains and around the lake. Very pretty scenery along the way. If you have the time it is well worth it! Not a lot of places to stop for food or restrooms so make sure you have gas and something to drink with you.
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Possibly best part of vacation!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"An excellent scenic drive! Winding, curving road in the mountains with great views.  We drove to Tortilla Flats and turned around after having lunch there. We weren't sure how much farther the road was open as we had heard it was closed at some point.  The Canyon Lake views were excellent!  On the way back we stopped at the Goldfield Ghost Town.  It was fun.  If we had kids, they would have loved it.  Wanted to check out Lost Dutchman State Park but didn't have time.  Highly recommend just taking the drive if nothing else."
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Love this Drive!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great escape to the desert wilderness just miles from the Phoenix Metro.  Beautiful scenery, nice lakes along the drive.  Due to road damage/closure we turned around about 7 miles east of Tortilla Flats, last 2 miles we skipped were dirt.  But definitely go the last 7 miles, more awesome views.   Tortilla Flats was a cool place to visit on the way back."
Apache Trail Scenic Drive,4.5,Spectacular,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views are great. Went all the last Vista overlooking Fish Creek. The last couple miles a narrow dirt road. The view at the very end is great.  The  drive is curvey, but is safe. "
Avalanche Lake,4.5,"Relatively easy hike, spectacular view!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is probably one of the easier trails (4.5 miles, fairly level) with a spectacular view at the end.  You walk through the woods and see dozens of trees on the ground from previous avalanches (as we were told and how it got its name).  When we could view the lake, with lots of trees down, we thought that was the end, but no, keep following the trail to the right and it will take you right to the edge of the lake, where you can still see snow on hillsides that don't see any sunshine and 2 waterfalls leading down to the lake.  Once there, find a place on the shoreline to sit and admire the view!"
Avalanche Lake,4.5,Great hike!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well, glacier was only open to the avalanche exit when we visited, but this hike was awesome!   It took us about 70 minutes to get from the trailhead to the lake (good deal of uphill).  We spent additional time picnicking and walking  along the side of the lake, then about 50 min to return (more downhill on return!).  Very busy with hikers, but trail is in good shape, and that view when you arrive at the lake makes it worth it!  "
Avalanche Lake,4.5,One of my Favorite Hikes to this Calm Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this trail on Monday, 8/31.  You can take the 5 mile round trip hike to Avalanche Lake through the Trail of the Cedars.  The first part, Trail of the Cedars, is very easy where parts of it is on flat boardwalk.  However, once the Avalanche Lake trail starts, it's not too difficult.  And along the way, the views are great."
Avalanche Lake,4.5,Loved this hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This hike was fantastic.  It was a under five miles round trip past waterfalls and through a forest to a beautiful interior lake.  The views were stunning!  
Avalanche Lake,4.5,Popular hike (P.S. continue past the lake for more adventures),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived just after 9am, and found parking a challenge, though we did find a spot.  So early arrival is helpful for more certainty of a parking spot."
Avalanche Lake,4.5,A must do for any one who is not comfortable in deep back country hiking.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail in to the lake is very well maintained and marked much better than trails in my part of Wyoming. the only issue we had was parking. avalanche tail head shares parking space with the only handicapped accessible trail in the park, so it was always insane trying to get into or out of the parking area. we had to try two different days just get a parking spot to hike in."
Avalanche Lake,4.5,"Beautiful lake , better later in day",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The lake was beautiful.  We got to the trailhead at 7:00 am to get parking and got one of the last spots.  When you start the hike if you go counterclockwise at the fork (so not on boardwalk) you will pass a bathroom building along the way.  Then you can take the fork the other way on way back to car when you leave.   The hike itself is through the woods and shaded the whole time, with no real views of any mountains until you get towards the end.  But the end is amazing.  We picnicked at the first lake/beach area.  When we got there the sun was just coming up over the mountain and cast a shadow over most of the “picture opportunities” at the lake.  It would’ve been prettier later in the day.  I’m hindsight we would’ve taken the shuttle to go later.  Highly recommend to keep walking the extra mile or so to the very end of the trail on the other side of the lake.  The lake views were just gorgeous from that side, the mountains reflected on the clear water and no shadows from that side."
Avalanche Lake,4.5,Avalanche lake via Trail of the Cedars,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hike. Moderate difficulty, good for all hikers. Parked at trailhead. Staying left  on trail of the cedars takes you past avalanche creek just before the avalanche lake trailhead. The other side of the TOTC has bathrooms with running water. The lake was nice despite being overcast and we had lunch here. We enjoyed walking along the lakeside rather than the trail after reaching lake. Everyone in our party enjoyed, would recommend."
Avalanche Lake,4.5,Gorgeous Avalanche Lake is a fairly easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Avalanche lake is a scenic, fairly easy hike. The path is heavily wooded, and it provides peek-through views of the mountains and interesting river watching.  The gem is the lake near the end.  Many people stop there and turn around after a few photos. After soaking up the lake view, if you’d like to feel a little more remote, continue on the path past the lake.  It goes on another .5 or .75 miles or so.  Try to arrive early or you’ll have a difficult time getting parking by the trailhead.  It’s popular… for good reason."
Avalanche Lake,4.5,Fantastic scenic reward at end of crowded hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"A 2-ish-mile steady climb up a well-graded trail that culminates in a spectacular cirque lake. This was a very worthwhile hike, despite the crowds we met along the way. I recommend that you arrive at the trailhead as early as possible. We got there at 8am and had a tough time finding a place to park. The large number of people at the lake detracted from the experience."
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Nice sightseeing and Fall colors,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is a $9 day pass fee, but it is worth it. We drive up to see the view over the lake, and then around the south side of the park to the summit view. Beautiful Fall colors despite some fog in the morning. It would be nice to return for some longer hikes and camping along the shore."
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Gorgeous park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous park! Visited during peak leaves in October, which was fantastic. Lake of the Clouds hike (Escarpment hike) was true highlight - gorgeous views throughout. Definitely very remote though - would recommend leaving plenty of daylight to reach hotel for the night - lots of wildlife / very dark if driving at night."
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Winter Ski wonderland,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing day at the Porcupine Mts. The runs were well groomed and all runs were open. We packed a great lunch and had it by the fireplace.The staff was very nice and accommodating. The prices were reasonable and got us our gear fast 120.00 for 2 lift and gear.
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Day in the Porcupine Mountains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We traveled here while heading thru the Upper Peninsula for our Anniversary and really enjoyed some of the views in the Porcupine Mountains. We especially really liked Lake of the Clouds we traveled there early evening and could see alot of Fog coming off the mountians, The Park Ranger was very kind and offered us Porky Style Smores too which had Striped Cookies and Marshmallows and told us about a Meteor shower to check out that night ...Definently stop here if you have the time and am traveling thru Michigan is some phenomenol views"
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Beautiful Park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stayed nearby 2 nights which gave us 1 full day exploring the Park. We started at the Visitor Center to get oriented, got a map & visited with the Lady there. Small Gift shop at Visitor center also. Yes there are some Black Flies, the Gal at the Visitor Center said they blow in off the Lake with the South Winds. Her suggestion was to try wearing pants if doing hiking etc... and can also try bug spray. We had a nice breeze the day we were there so they weren't bad. "
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,The Porkies 'Speak' for themselves.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Porkies experience has always been a gem. Have spent time at several cabins lakeshore and interior. Brought my son and grandson this time to Speakers 4 cabin. What a pristine setting, phenomenal view and sunsets. Nice hike in from the east...but not too long for a 10 year old...easy trail access north/south; perfect hike to Presque Isle SP and waterfalls. Backpacking, campfires, story telling, brats and beans, exploring, appreciating whatever nature revealed to us and even a 'refreshing' immersion into Lake Superior made for a memorable and quality experience."
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Awesome hiking!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lots of waterfalls and amazing vistas to hike to. Beautiful fall color. Camping right on Lake Superior or deeper in the forests...backcountry campsites and remote cabins....something for everyone. 
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Not To Be Missed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This State park costs $9 for out of state visitors.  You can see the  Lake in the Clouds and several waterfalls and picnic areas to eat lunch.  Beautiful drive and well worth the cost to get in.  Lots of traffic and little parking so be patient.
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Lake of the Clouds!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a beautiful lake to see, and so easy to get to. You can drive right up to it, and take a very short walk to overlook the lake. I would like to come back when the leaves are changing as I'm sure it is spectacular! We also walked/climbed to Summit Peak, another highlight of the park. Finally, the loop around the waterfalls, while long and more challenging, was worth the effort. Overall, a beautiful park and worth the drive."
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park,5.0,Manabezho Falls is worth a visit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Manabezho Falls is an easy .2 mile walk from the parking lot. We came during a regional drought but it was still worth the price of daily admission and  a quick visit on our way to the Eagle Harbor lighthouse.  Very little water during our visit. These are suppose to be the largest falls in the Porcupine Mountains. The stairs and boardwalks were impressive. It’s a great park to hike.
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,"Terrible, unsafe trail to a terrible view.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Anyone who rates this trail positively has never seen mountains before. The views are terrible past the bluffs, and the summit is nothing but a cairn of rocks surrounded by trees so you can’t even see anything from the top, but even if you could, there’s nothing to see because all the landmarks of the valley are covered by trees. Also, very unsafe. At multiple points on the trail, there are hundred foot drops with no guardrails. Several of the bridges are only half built with only one guardrail and nothing on the other side. They can build multiple lodges on top of the mountain but they don’t want to put up guardrails to make sure people don’t fall to their deaths? Sounds like Tennessee. It’s a steep, unsafe, and difficult hike with no payoff. Save yourself the trouble and just go to one of the waterfalls instead."
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,Amazing trail to the Arch but beware the slippery cave’s slope at the top!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I took our almost 2 year old to the Alum Cave Trail because it seemed like a really popular trail for all ages. Little did we know the difficulty from the Arch to the Cave was rather advanced! Very beautiful and not packed even though there was hardly any parking and we had to park 1/4 of a mile away from entrance. It was worth it and our daughter slept the entire way down the mountain. We had rented an Osprey Carrier from the NOK (at the foothills of the mountain in Gatlinburg). Thank God for that too—super great price $20 or $30 for one day, then $10 every day after that. There were no bugs at all; a lot less than we expected or maybe our bug spray really worked! The pictures are worth more than any review! One thing I highly stress is that if you are traveling with children that are too big to carry and you happen to go all the way to the alum cave, do not let them walk around up there. A 12 year old girl tripped on a rock no where near the edge and fell head first down the cliff and was caught by travelers on the stairs going up to the cave. It was the scariest trauma we have ever witnessed, the mom nearly fell going after her. Several bystanders rushed with medical supplies and fixed her up. The girl walked back down the mountain with her parents limping and bandaged knee. Very very slippery slope of dirt and trip/falling hazards."
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,Amazing if you go early,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail was so fun. We did the full trail to the top of  Mt Leconte and has so much fun. We got there at about 7 am and the parking lot was filling up already. The trail is easy until the cave. The second half to the summit is very rough and steep, but SO WORTH IT. "
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,Well worth the climb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a strenuous climb which is quite steep in places. The day we hiked up to the cave was raining at times which made the trail a little more slippery.
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,Challenging but amazing views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My family loved this hike.  We decided to continue on and hike from Alum cave to the top of Mt Le Conte.  It was very challenging in places but the views are top notch.   Some scary sections near the top but my eleven year olds did ok.  Bring lots of water.   Keep in mind the restaurant at the top doesn’t open until noon so if you leave early in the morning it might not be open yet when you reach the top.   You can refill water bottles there for your trip back down.   We loved this hike.
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,Best Hike in the Smokies ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Outstanding hike. The best hike I did in the Smokey Mountains. The first 2.3 miles is a moderate hike and takes you past a cascading river, Arch Rock, inspiration point and Alum Cave Bluff. The next 3 miles is a strenuous hike but so rewarding with incredible views along the way and especially when you reach the summit of Mount LeConte at Clifftops and at Myrtle’s Point. Mount LeConte Lodge at the summit offers rustic overnight accommodations. Best enjoyed on a day with clear skies. Very popular hike so arrive early at or before sunrise if you want to park at the trailhead parking lot if visiting on a busy day. However, there is also parking along the road nearby. "
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,"Felt like uphill all the way, but the rewards are worth it",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived at the Alum Cave Trailhead parking lot at 7:00 am on a Sunday. There were 4 parking spaces available in the smaller lot by the restrooms, but there were still plenty of spaces left in the larger parking lot closer to the road and there were many cars parked along the road, presumably overnight hikers who had parked there the previous day.  Since it was a very nice weather forecast (sunny and high in low 70s in Gatlinburg), the trail was crowded. But, we found everyone to be very friendly and very polite – letting faster hikers pass, offering encouragement, and keeping a good social distance as much as possible.  A few hikers wore masks, but most did not or would pull their masks/gaiters up when passing.  We sat down in Alum Cave to enjoy the view and have a snack. After Alum Cave, the number of hikers decreased a bit. We are three women in our early 50s and we are not avid hikers, but are reasonably healthy.  We were each carrying packs around 20-25 lbs each.  The ascent was tough, but very doable – we took it slow and steady with lots of stops for breath, to let other hikers pass, and to take pictures. Including the snack stop, it took us 5 hours to hike the 5 miles to reach LeConte Lodge, where we were spending the night.  We each had one hiking pole, which we highly recommend.  The trail is well maintained with lots of wooden steps, steps carved into rock, and cable handrails.  But, the 2600 feet of elevation gain on the trail makes it feel like almost all the trail is an ascent – the very end, just before the junction with Rainbow Falls Trail near the lodge is the only area that seems to be flat, which is a welcome relief.  There are bridges for the stream crossings. Many areas of the trail were muddy/wet from the rain two days previous and from what we assume are springs. Good hiking shoes/boots are a must, as is a good supply of water.  There are many places with breaks in the trees with inspiring views, along with the glimpses of Alum Cave creek and going through Arch Rock as well as Alum Cave itself.  Even if you are not staying at the Lodge, there are pit toilets and water pumps available at the Lodge to all hikers. There is also a gift and supply store in the office of the Lodge. Beyond the Lodge, there is another 0.7 mile hike out to Myrtle Point for more views and to see the rock cairn which marks the actual peak of Mount LeConte.  And, there is also a 0.3 mile loop to High Tops just beyond the Lodge for more views."
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,A rewarding experience,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"After visiting Clingman Dome, Cades Cove and Newfound Gap, I had time to pick one hike in GSMNP. This is the one I picked and I was not disappointed. The hike is of moderate difficulty. It passes by and over a number of beautiful streams and goes through a natural rock arch. The 'cave"" is really the overhang of a cliff, but it is rather unique. The hike is certainly worth the experience. I was there on a Sunday and it pays to get there early for a good parking spot."
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,A must do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our favorite so far.  My husband and I are in our mid-50’s and very active.  This is rated “strenuous”. We loved the challenge of elevation gain (1,125) and the Arch Rock and Cave Bluffs were very neat. Many stairs to climb throughout and after a long winding stair climb up - all of a sudden you are at the bluffs.  Which was too big to capture in a total photo.  Wear hiking boots and bring several water bottles and snacks.  It is important to get to the trail head early.  (7:30-8am) There are two parking lots and the trailhead is in between. A little hard to see right away. "
Alum Cave Trail,5.0,Awesome Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I have been coming to this area for our whole life and this was the first time either of us had hiked the trail.  
Kauai Path,5.0,"Awesome caves to explore, tortoises to see, and plenty of beach to walk",5.0 of 5 bubbles,We spent an amazing day here exploring nature.  A Univerisity of Hawii student gave us a tour of the cave.  The tour is free; suggested donation is $10 a person which is greatly worth it!  Bring a cooler with some snacks and beverages for your beach walk.  We saw a napping monk seal and enjoyed having less people on the beach.
Kauai Path,5.0,Multi use path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented bikes from our hotel in Kapaa and cycled north to the end of the path. Beautiful scenery along a well built gently sloping path. There are frequent shelters along the route with roof, table and benches. The path is separate from the road but shared by cyclists and walkers, so stay aware for other path users"
Kauai Path,5.0,Nice Views but Little Shade,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This paved path runs about 8 miles from Kapaa north.  There are quite a few people who walk and bike as it runs like along the coast.  There's very little shade or cover if it's hot or rains, but we enjoyed a couple of walks and the views are beautiful.  "
Kauai Path,5.0,Kapaa Board Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Kapaa Board Walk is an absolute delight.  There are several places to begin but we generally start where the multiple parking is and the ocean is rather grand. You can determine how long you want to make it and return to where you began.  The views are all beautiful and the path is paved for walking as well as bike riding.
Kauai Path,5.0,Beach biking along the Kapaa shore,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We biked the Kauai path north from the Sheraton Kauai beach resort one morning. It was beautiful along the coast with some rest stops and bathrooms along the way. Take water and plan to share the path with walkers. Recommended!
Kauai Path,5.0,Kapaa bike path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I love the Kapaa bike path. I ride my bike on the path about five times a week. This article says the path is eight miles long. It's not. The path is closer to 4.25 miles long. My round trip on the path is 8.5 miles.
Kauai Path,5.0,A Few Tips to the Historic Pineapple Dump Bridge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Using the East Shore Beach Shared Path, we started our walk from Kealia Beach.  It is a wide path also used by bicyclists.  This path goes well over ten miles, but from Kealia Beach, the distance to the Historic Pineapple Bridge is but a mile."
Kauai Path,5.0,Incredible-Low Cost-Beautiful Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the nicest bike/ped paths in the world.  Incredible views, beautiful beaches and nice places to eat/drink. "
Kauai Path,5.0,Easy Bike Ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Kauai Path is a great place to ride your bike or walk.  The path runs about 4 1/2 miles basically from the Kauai Outrigger on Hwy 56 to a sudden dead end about 1 1/2 miles past Kealia Beach State park.  The path is mostly 5 foot wide concrete or asphalt along a street.  It is clearly marked and easy to find.  You can park in several place in the town of Kapaa and start biking or walking. The path follows the shore line and is the route of one of the original narrow gauge sugar cane railroads on Kauai. The path ends where the county has not negotiated a right away from private property owners. There are at least three public restrooms on the route.  If you rent a bike or use your own be careful not to leave it unsecured while you sit by the ocean or stop for lunch.  Theft is a problem in Kapaa, there are many individuals lingering in the area waiting for tourist to leave something unguarded."
Kauai Path,5.0,Easy to Bike and Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We rented some beach cruiser bikes from our resort in Kapaa to experience this path.
Exit Glacier,4.5,Exit Glacier,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked to Exit Glacier with a group while staying in Seward. The hike itself was fairly easy and the trail is well marked. The trail begins as a flat easy stroll through the trees, then climbs up a slope which gives a spectacular view of the valley below and the surround mountains. The trail affords several excellent views of the glacier itself. The glacier ends in a narrow ravine, and melting water from the glacier forms a beautiful braided river that flows from the ravine across the valley floor."
Exit Glacier,4.5,Great hike to an amazing end!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took our 8 and 10 year Olds, as well as our 60 and 70 year old parents. This hike is not overly strenuous, but there is some uphill and uneven terrain. If you're even in half way decent shape, you'll be good. You don't have to, but I recommend waterproof shoes so you can go into the basin area, and see the stream and :ice boulders"", it was a cool experience. Worth the drive to Seward from Anchorage for the day."
Exit Glacier,4.5,Cool seeing a Glacier,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Drove in the dark to arrive and hike the trail to Exit Glacier at dawn and we were the only people there. The trail is easy except for one part that you have to climb up on some black rocks. From there you could go through a field to another hill top. The Glacier has receded through the years and I don't think that trail took you right up to it. We had some good views of the Glacier along our trail. We were pressed on time so we ended our hike probably around 4 miles and turned back. We didn't see any wild life, but the board on the ranger building  said that someone saw a moose hiking yesterday and someone else saw a bear yesterday. It was pouring down rain for part of our hike and the streams were flowing fast and high. We had to cross one stream on a board and when we were coming back through the water was higher. The best view of the Glacier was from a look out pull over coming into the park."
Exit Glacier,4.5,Unmatched Beauty and Awesomeness!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited the Exit Glacier both on our own and on a guided tour - I recommend BOTH! The adults in our group first visited Exit and hiked up to Marmot Meadows, then went off trail a bit to get a better view of the glacier. Be aware of your surrounding and safety to know when you are getting into dangerous territory (too close to the glacier and the sliding rocks), but it's worth the trek. The hike up is definitely physically trying and I'd recommend taking hiking poles - we didn't have them and would have liked to, especially if we'd gone up further. We happened to visit on a day that was dry, and it was gorgeous, but still a bit slippery."
Exit Glacier,4.5,Worth the stop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful to see- the main trail to the glacier is fairly easy. The Harding Ice Trail is definitely a lot more difficult but the view is very pretty! Overall, great stop. Would definitely recommend taking a half-day to full-day (depending on the trail) to see it"
Exit Glacier,4.5,Great view at the end and pretty easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The view of the glacier at the end was really cool. This is a pretty easy hike but hiking boots are recommended since it gets rocky. We completed this hike with our 15 month old so we did the shorter trail but it still offers a really nice view of the glacier and fjords.
Exit Glacier,4.5,Impressive hike to see disappearing beauty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Go early as parking fills and trail is extremely popular.  Restrooms available at trailhead.  Trailhead is well marked and trail is paved for about a quarter of the trail to a lower viewing area.  Trail includes one stream crossing on a plank, however depending on time of year may be underwater.  Stone steps for the steep sections should be used with caution; children need supervision.  Glacier has receded dramatically, but the hike was worth the effort."
Exit Glacier,4.5,Exit Glacier ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The trailhead is a 15 min drive from Seward. It’s not too long of a hike. When you get to the end and can view the glacier it gets windy and cold. You may want to do the 8-9 mile hike to the top of the ice field- seems pretty cool. 
Exit Glacier,4.5,Must do activity in Seward,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a must see attraction in Seward. 
Exit Glacier,4.5,Bring mosquito spray!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited Exit Glacier on a very cloudy day with occasional rain showers but still enjoyed the experience. We hiked the Glacier Overlook Loop Trail with a total distance of approximately 2 miles. The first half of the trail going up is easy but the second half of the ascent is more challenging, particularly when the rocky ground is wet. We were very happy to have mosquito spray with us. The mosquitoes are large and aggressive. The blue color of the glacier is cool and I recommend the trip."
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,Short hike to a nice walk behind falls.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike to the falls with the entire family...2 grandparents, 4 adults, 1 teen and a 7 and 2.5 year old. Everyone walked on their own and made it there and back. We walked behind the falls, touched the falls, put our feet in the water and took many great shots. The 2.5 year old grandson even had us singing the Ants go Marching as we hiked the trail."
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,Go Early!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our itinerary got moved around so we ended up doing Roaring Fork Nature Drive mid-late morning. When we got to Grotto Falls parking area, it was so full that we decided to come back early the next day. When I say early, I mean you should try to be there around 8am or shortly after. We were there mid week after Labor Day. It was worth going back for. We really enjoyed the hike and the falls. You are able to walk behind the falls without getting wet. "
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,Beautiful falls,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a good hike with a beautiful Falls. The pictures really don't do this Falls any justice it really is beautiful in person. The hike is pretty steep going up but going down it was super easy. It was very crowded trying to find parking that's probably the main negative. Also the drive-up is super steep and a little scary.
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,GROTTO FALLS BETTER THEN RAINBOW FALLS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Get to the park before 9 am if possible, because parking fills up fast. Grotto fasts is a better waterfall than Rainbow falls, shorter and easier hike. Grotto Falls is about an hr hike, somewhat uphill, not bad. You can go behind the falls."
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,Great Hike to a Cool Waterfall ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Arrived later in the day about 2 hours before sunset and not too crowded. I was able to find a parking spot on the road not far from the trailhead parking. 2.6 mile out and back hike that is mildly strenuous as it is a steady but not steep uphill climb to the waterfall. Able to do this in just over an hour. The waterfall is great and make sure you experience walking behind the falls. Much better than the hike to Rainbow Falls which requires twice the effort and time with a waterfall that is not as interesting as Grotto Falls in my opinion. Highlight was seeing the llamas returning from the Lodge at Mt LeConte and even better seeing a bear come out of the woods just after I got into my parked car. 
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,Amazing Experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Abosoultley Amazing hike. It's a moderate hike and not so hard to do. The beautiful falls at the end make it absolutely worth it!! Beautiful waterfalls that you can walk behind and take pictures it's absolutely stunning!
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,"Great little hike, good for younger kids",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice little hike, parking at the trailhead is difficult. We parked about a quarter mile away and walked up the road to the trailhead. The hike itself was not very strenuous and was relatively short. The falls is very nice, you can walk behind it and reach out and touch it. This is a very busy hike so if you want to avoid the crowd go very early! Overall a nice hike for a family. The drive to and from the trailhead is very nice and a good chance to see some bear and other wildlife."
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,"Moderate hike to a beautiful, secluded waterfall!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"3 mile round trip moderate hike to a secluded waterfall “grotto”. The hike itself is not difficult- it is, however entirely uphill on the way there. Good news is that the way back is all downhill and super easy! The path itself is very well constructed and worn. Super smooth and easy to walk. The parks department did a great job of building infrastructure for walking. The waterfall itself was beautiful and in a bigger, gorgeous setting. Only downside was the amount of people there. Just be patient and try to find a rock to sit on to relax and take in the scenery. Highly recommend!!"
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,Great hike if you arrive at trailhead at daybreak.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of my favorite hikes in the park with the caveat that you need to arrive at the trailhead at or before daybreak. Why? There are only enough parking spaces for around 15 cars. After that, you must park off the sides of the road - often in a ditch. We saw people walking a long way to get a parking space so getting there early is the trick."
Grotto Falls Trail,4.5,Absolutely a must see.. simply stunning..,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I would definitely suggest walking/hiking this trail. The waterfall is spectacular and you get to walk behind the waterfall.Even though this is paved, please wear proper footwear, flip flops are not appropriate for he steepness and the walk, especially if you want to walk behind the waterfall. Flip Flops get slippery when wet..... Also, I found this hike to be harder on your legs and body due to the paved pathway. I found Laurel Falls trail easier on my legs and body to walk on and endure. Hiking/walking this trail and talking with friends and stopping along the way for photos makes this easier to manage and a lot of fun. Remember to take a trash bag and some water to drink! Parking can be tricky, you can park along the road. Please be sure to use restrooms prior to arriving."
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,Take Time to Learn about our American Indian!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As you drive to the museum you encounter so many animals, beautiful bodies of water with spring houses and/or waterfalls.  The displays of Indian clothing and their way of life is quite humbling. So many beautiful rugs/blankets.  The last hand made canoe is outstanding as well as the story that goes with it.  Impressive paintings hang on most every wall.  Stage Coach's to oxen carts and airplanes to TNT pickups.  "
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,animals and art ...oh my,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You will pull off the highway and pay admittance to drive into the massive property. You will drive by bison, deer, ostrich, llama and cattle etc that you will enjoy but, the real treat for me was going into the museum of western art and seeing the artwork of famous and not so famous although just as good. You can spend at least a couple hours if you have time looking at paintings and castings and interactive displays. IF you are into western art, this is the place to visit. "
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,Definitely worth the drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wow, had no idea this place even existed or what it entailed. The museum is spectacular with all the many Indian artifacts, paintings, etc. Plus, all the history of Phillips Petroleum with exhibits of airplanes, old trucks, etc. There is certainly something here for everyone. They also had a wonderful gift shop with unique items. The Welcome Center just opened this year with a beautiful sitting/conference room with a huge stained glass window, antlers covering the ceiling in the lobby and a small cafe. We also went into the lodge but the only part open is the living area. Everything else is roped off which was a bit disappointing but the guide was very informative and it was interesting to see all the mounted animal heads covering the walls."
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,A Wonderful Drive and Visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited right before Christmas, so lights and decorations were everywhere!  I even saw Santa!  Besides that, we enjoyed a delightful drive to the museum campus through Mother Nature's beautiful landscape, flora, and fauna.  The museum was world class and full of great, detailed, well-maintained displays featuring Oklahoma's fascinating heritage.  It is worth the trip.  I would think it'd be a great destination with children of middle school age and up."
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,A gem in Oklahoma.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Make sure to visit this “gem” in Oklahoma. An animal preserve, a museum, and a history of petroleum. "
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,A Highlight of our Travels,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We saw lots of wildlife from buffalo to zebra and emu to longhorns.  There is a children’s play area, lots of shaded picnic areas, a nice animal petting area, and, of course, the Phillip’s cabin with spectacular back-porch view.  Despite all the latter, the central point of coming here is the truly world-class art museum comprised of Indian and other artifacts Frank Phillips collected, plus information about oil exploration and reclamation.  Plan significant time to absorb the gems here."
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,Well worth the time! Lots of animals and history ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Woolaroc Museum was one of the most enjoyable stops on our trip. There is an extensive exhibit of Indian and Pioneer artifacts, along with an amazing artwork collection portraying both. Go downstairs to view a HUGE Colt gun collection. The variety of animals on the grounds is impressive too."
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,Favorite trip - phenomenal adventure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unlike any other museum and wildlife acres - so loved this day at Frank Phillips (Phillips 66) 3,700 acres. You must do yourself and your children and/or grandchildren a favor and gift of enjoying this place. It has collections of all sorts. It has Frank Phillips airplane. Too much to speak about. Just GO. The fee is free for children and for adults $12.00 seniors and $14.00 adults. So worth the fee. I love this place. Buffalo came up to the car too. The original Phillips 66 gas station is now located on this property."
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,Disappointed,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The museum is filled with interesting artifacts and information, however we were disappointed with the amount of ""wildlife"" we did not see.  The gal who sold the tickets told us they were running mostly free range.  Saw very little roaming wild except long horn cattle, two water buffalo and 3 elk.  Everything else which was very  little, were penned up."
Woolaroc Museum & Wildlife Preserve,5.0,worth the long drive out!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I recently drove from our home in southeastern PA to OKC to learn about Oklahoma’s history, settlement, and flora & fauna; this was the first site we visited in our quest. We enjoyed the drive through the nice grounds up to the museum building, passing bison, deer, elk, and other wild animals. Exploring the numerous museum galleries was the highlight for us, with exhibits covering Native Americans, cowboys, cattle ranching, oil drilling, and more. Included throughout are many artifacts, textiles, paintings, sculptures, carved wooden dioramas, taxidermy, and historic vehicles. Other displays feature firearms, Frank Phillips’ life, aviation, and minerals. After leaving the main museum, we stopped at the small Bunkhouse Wildlife Gallery and enjoyed the North American waterfowl and Big Game displays. Also nearby was the Lodge, displaying numerous mounted animal heads (which were not hunting trophies)."
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,Best park in the city,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful grounds, well maintained walking/ running trails. The falls are easily found on the main trail and are active through the year even in the summer dryer months. There are bathroom facilities as well as covered picnic areas. Dogs allowed on a leash and picking up after them is enforced."
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,Some wonderfully green space with a small and calming waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very green and lovely park with a beautiful waterfall and a number of hiking trails. The Whatcom Falls Park is located in the quaint town of Bellingham. While the hikes aren't super difficult, you don't need to hike at all to see the waterfalls - it is only a few feet from the parking lot on a paved trail. You have the option to walk around a little to get on top of the falls as well. The waterfalls are not enormous, but they are very pretty and had a soothing effect. There is a stone bridge with a view to the falls, that looks magnificent in the setting as well. The park isn't far from downtown Bellingham and is a must visit if you are in or around the area."
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,A peaceful public park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of my favorite aspects of visiting this public park is how filled it was with people enjoying it.  Hiking, picnicking, or just staring at a stream, it represented the best of a public space.  As the long-time maintenance worker at the park near our home once said, ""Parks are meant to be used.""  They're not museums.  They're not for a select few.  Whatcom is a public space filled with meandering, interconnected trails that, for this non-Northwesterner, were magically different than what I'm used to."
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,"Great place to walk in the woods, hope the falls recover",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were here right at the end of May and the falls were very uninspiring.  Several people said they are not normally like that, and seeing the pictures they look spectacular.  But even without the falls, there are nice paths along the river, and some good swimming holes if you wanted to get into the water.  Definitely a great place for a natural getaway in the midst of Bellingham."
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,Peaceful,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It was very peaceful to be able to walk by the river and falls.  I am not sure if I would call them falls as they're not that big.  I think at the end of spring after more rain it would have been more impressive. There are many walking trails around the area which I liked. 
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,Great stop if just passing thru,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous park, can see all of it in just a couple of hours. Also great stop is limited on time in area which I had and am glad I picked this as my one place to stop. Nice kept trails, beautiful large trees and of course the falls along with stone bridge."
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,Lots of shade,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Visiting from out of state. Seattle was way too hot so we explored north. Tiny waterfall. Great trials. Lots of shade. Lots of hard packed trials. Be careful for fast moving cyclists. The falls are close to parking lot. We hiked about three miles. You can do as much or as little. Tons of people in the water.
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,"Lovely park, great walks",5.0 of 5 bubbles,Finally made time to visit this park and we were not disappointed. The place is close to town but feels like you're far out of the city. Nice place for a walk or to find a shady place to read.
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,Advice for those with mobility issues,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We didn't know there were two parking lots at first.
Whatcom Falls Park,4.5,Nice falls and hiking trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The stone bridge that you walk across by the falls is quite the sight! There's several trails that you can walk in the area. One will lead you to an abandoned railroad track section suspended on a high tressel (pretty cool). There's also a kiddie playset and bathrooms at the parking lot. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area. 
Presidential Trail,4.5,"Fun hike, but in June 2020 there was construction limiting things considerably",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is no additional charge to do this trail. You pay $10 (unless you have a discount like senior or military) to enter the park and can self guide on the trail. Unfortunately, there was construction and we could only do about half of the trail. There was additional informaiton about the monument along the trail that you could read. We did a self tour. The kids with us, aged 8-15, enjoyed themselves."
Presidential Trail,4.5,Lots of great views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When we planned our trip, we figured Mt Rushmore would take us less than an hour. We were wrong! We spent lots of time in the park and ""hiked"" the Presidential Trail, which takes you through the woods, gives information on each of the former Presidents, and provides many different angles for picture-taking. It's a short hike, but a must if you visit the park!"
Presidential Trail,4.5,Best Way to See the Monument from Every Angle plus Exercise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rushmore is incredible and something every American needs to see.  However, once you seen it, what else is there to do.  There is a great trail that takes you directly underneath the statues.  Not only will it provide you a multiple of viewing locations, it is also the only way to visit the sculptor's studio that will show you the original sculpture made by Gutzon Borglum.  Rangers also have programming talks here to explain how the work was done.  "
Presidential Trail,4.5,Unique views of Rushmore and beautiful fall colors,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great trail that is not difficult that gives you some unique views of Mt Rushmore. I suggest going to the left as you face Rushmore over the right you will be going down all the steep stairs instead of going up them. It is a loop that brings you to the sculptor’s studio.
Presidential Trail,4.5,Look for the Secret Passageway!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"No spoilers here, but be sure to keep your eyes open for additional adventure along the Presidential Trail.  Some maintenance was happening when we were there, so the full trail was not accessible, but we enjoyed every photo op along the way.  The Artist's Studio is along the trail, so stop there and see the ""model"", plus hear the ranger talk.  There are helpful, friendly rangers all along the way to answer your questions.  Plus, you'll get some different angles of the monument."
Presidential Trail,4.5,Don't miss the sculptor's studio!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We ventured along the Presidential Ave after getting a look at the memorial.  This is a definite must!  Although there are many stairs, it is well worth getting to see the memorial from various angles and a bit closer."
Presidential Trail,4.5,Get up close and personal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail has something like 750 steps, but it is certainly worth it. You have to realize that you are getting closer to a large memorial so you are seeing less and less of the memorial as a whole and more of an up close and personal view of under their noses and things like that. I was always told you couldn't get close to the memorial, but this trail certainly lets you get up close and personal. I would highly recommend this trail when you visit Mount Rushmore and soak in the closer views."
Presidential Trail,4.5,Trail to the monument,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great views of the monument. You get much closer, away from the crowds and the opportunity to see how amazing this work really is. It can take a little effort with the stairs but great views if you have to stop and rest."
Presidential Trail,4.5,Great Views!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The trail is a fairly easy half mile loop around the amphitheater that offers some spectacular views and vantage points of the mountain. There are some nice informational pieces to read along the way. Plenty of picture worthy spots to take advantage of as well. There are quite a few steps but there are places to rest along the way if you are with young children or anyone needing extra time to walk the loop. 
Presidential Trail,4.5,Do It!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a short loop that brings you a bit nearer the actual carvings without any steep or strenuous hiking. Along the trail there are some great historical facts. You also get to see the mountain from more angles, giving you a better view of Presidents Jefferson and Roosevelt. It probably took us about 40 minutes total to make the entire loop, and that included several stops along the way for pictures and reading."
Mist Trail,5.0,Should be top Yosemite hike on everyone's list,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Worth every minute of the climb! The first mile or so is bland upward climbing but soon enough the falls come into view and everything becomes so immersive that you forget about the continual stairs (and there are indeed large parts of actual stairs here). Even during this summer of extremely low water levels and an essentially completely dry Yosemite Falls by late July, both Vernal and Nevada Falls were incredibly beautiful."
Mist Trail,5.0,There is water on the way up,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I just wanted to inform you all that there are a few free fountains water on the way up. About after 30/45min going up.
Mist Trail,5.0,Highlight of our California ( SF-Monterey-Yosemite) fortnight - WOW!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Probably the best hike we’ve ever done as a family, we walked to Vernal Falls first and then on up Nevada Falls and back. C.7 miles, c3,500 total climb, c.4 hours walking but c.7 hours total with all the WOW view stops and a proper break at the top of Nevada Falls before following the John Muir trail back down (a little longer but less busy and not just retreading the steps you take up)"
Mist Trail,5.0,"Drenched, and loved it!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After a heavy winter snow, the run off of water was exceptional.  The trail can take some time and finish and it is always up hill with a lot of steps!  The views are worth it though! Absolutely bring a waterproof jacket, pack etc.  My trip past Vernal falls was so full of spray the falls were almost unseeble, some choosing to actally turn back ( though I doubt it's normally this bad)  since the trail was with in the heavy spray. It is really worth the trip, and plan to spend some time at the top of Nevada falls where you can sit down for a picnic!  The views are great as you look down the valley past the ""silver apron"" and ""Emerald pools"".  "
Mist Trail,5.0,Steep But Worth It,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had already done quite a bit of walking/hiking before we started up this trail (from the parking lot to Lower Yosemite Falls, then to Mirror Lake, then to the trailhead for this hike)  since the shuttle buses are not operating this Summer.  For that reason, I only walked up the the Vernal Falls footbridge - my wife did continue a bit further to the bottom of the stairs going up to the top of Vernal Falls.  Even up to the footbridge, the trail, while wide and paved, is still quite steep and also pretty crowded.  If we had been able to ride the shuttles to some of the trailheads I would have liked to go further up on this trail, but by the end of the day I had put over 14 miles in, so I was glad I decided to stop here.  It was still quite a beautiful hike, and one everyone who is capable of should try and do."
Mist Trail,5.0,Not for kids,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an amazing trail that leads to Vernal and Nevada Falls. It is not for kids though! We saw so many young kids or people hiking with flip flops on, I hope they weren't going past the steps to Vernal Falls. It is not too bad of a hike to the bottom of Vernal and you can get a great view! But once the stairs get wet, and the trail gets crowded, it can be very tricky. More people die on this trail than any other part of Yosemite. We turned around once the handrail for the stairs ended, it was too crowded and slippery to go any further without something to hold on to. Still got some amazing pictures!"
Mist Trail,5.0,Wonderful Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Considered  a moderately strenuous hike covering slightly over 1000 feet in elevation change. The Mist trail is 0.8 miles to the footbridge (so 1-1/2 miles round trip) OR, 1.2 miles approx to the top of Vernal Falls(2.4 miles round trip) . Good ops of Vernal Falls from the footbridge. Also of note is that there is water available just past the footbridge to fill up water bottle. The second half of the hike from footbridge to the falls is considerably more uphill, but my wife and I in our mid 60's got to the base of Vernal Falls. Allow for 2 to 3 hours depending on length of hike and ability.  Recommendation is to hike in the morning during the summer months!"
Mist Trail,5.0,Our Favorite Hike at Yosemite... so far!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was hands down our favorite and most challenging hike at Yosemite considering we were on a family trip. It starts off pretty easy, with a steady uphill, and when you reach the spectacular verbal falls, it’s approximately 600 steps to the top. "
Mist Trail,5.0,Challenging steep uphill hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For these 60+ y.o. legs, was a bit challenging. The walk to Vernal Falls bridge is easy, to the top of Vernal Falls moderate but WORTH IT, and extended to the bridge that gives you a great view of Nevada Falls. We turned around here because it would be another 1000 ft and 2 hrs to go all the way to the top of Nevada falls. "
Mist Trail,5.0,Trail with lots of civilization,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We headed up the Mist Trail with dozens of other hikers and walkers.  The first part to the footbridge is paved and busy busy busy.  The view of Illilouette Fall is an extra bonus.
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Parking lots,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Bad experience trip hiking parking lot. 
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Manitou Incline tips - go early!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"1) Reservations: Online reservations are required and free. They open seven days in advance, but unfortunately the website doesn't say at what time (or at least it didn't at the time I made my reservation). So I tried at midnight, then 6 am (because the Incline opens at 6 am) and eventually found out that reservations open at 7 am. Print your confirmation or save it to your phone, because there is poor reception at the trailhead."
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Tough but awesome climb!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are in shape and ready for this the go for it! Totally worth it to climb those 2700+ steps, the steps are recently renovated and are well maintained. It gets hot so have layers to take off and water. The trail down is also beautiful, don’t walk back down the stairs, walk the trail!"
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Small victories,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When researching what to do in COS, I stumbled across this adventure and knew it was a must ""attempt"" and it quickly became a goal.  A friend and I made reservations (done just to keep the people spread out throughout the day - might be a covid thing) for a Friday morning.  The temps were cool but the clear sky and bright sun made for the need of thin layers for the climb.  The steps start out shallow and flat but eventually get steep and narrow, at some points almost needing to bear crawl it just to keep your weight going towards the stairs because it would be easy to loose your balance when it gets super steep.  "
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Challenging Hike Is So Worth It!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What an amazing workout!  (Notice I said workout and not hike.). It was physically challenging yet highly highly rewarding.  I’m an avid runner/rower… but for me, the what made this hike really challenging is the elevation.  Lots of deep breathing and breaks to make sure I could catch my breath.  And on top of that, the view is amazing!!!!!!  It is a must do!"
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Very Tough!!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We just flew in from the east coast and went straight to the incline.  It was one of the hardest things I have done ever and I am in pretty good shape. Take lots of fluids and breaks along the way.  The views are wonderful, but once you reach the top it is anti climatic.  Be prepared for over an hour hike down through the woods on a trail after the hike up the incline"
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,CRAZY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As the signs warn, this is an extreme workout at very high altitude that can result in health risks in some populations. We are 27 and 33 y/o who are moderately active without altitude experience. It took us about 2 hrs to get to the top bc we had to take several stops. This is NOT for unfit people nor for small children. Lots of water is a must and a snack if you need it. To descend it took us about 1 hr and 30 min through the walking trail. We reserved at 4pm but in retrospect, if you are inexperienced, it would be best to reserve earlier so you are not rushed by sundown. Overall, it was an AMAZING experience with AMAZING views but definitely not for everyone. "
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Get there early to beat the heat … and enjoy it.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is not for the weary or little ones. 99% of what you see on here is accurate.
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Awesome hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You need to make free reservations online and would suggest an early time.  We had 0830 and by the time we got half way up it was hot. I didn’t think it would be to bad as we both exercise all the time.  I was so wrong.  This is a workout and took nearly 4 hours to go up and then down the 4 mile  Barr trail. We Did rest at the top though and took pictures.  Plenty of places while going up to stop and rest in the shade.  Saw people of all ages and weight doing this and completing it.  Just don’t get in a hurry and enjoy the views. Also, bring plenty of water"
Manitou Springs Incline,5.0,Strenuous but fun hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fairly tiring hike, but getting to the top is worth it. Do not bring kids who are not used to hiking. Our kids (almost 12 and 10) made it, with some moaning. Reservation required to hike at the moment, keep the bracelet as proof you made it is recommended. Bring water, and don't go down the stairs. For the closest parking, look up ISC Hiking Parking on Facebook and make a reservation. Don't underestimate the time you will also need to hike down again. Time taken - one of us did it in 1 hour, the other 3 of us did it in 2 hrs. But then we took a further hour at least to get back down."
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,Beautiful hiking trail with stunning views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Loved the hike out to Cape Flattery lookout where you can view the lighthouse. Trail was a bit crowded when we got there but were able to find parking along the side of road not far from actual parking lot. You must purchase parking permit from the Maka tribe in order to park here as this location is on the Maka Indian reservation. We stopped to purchase our permit in Neah Bay at the Maka Tribe visitor center. There are several locations in the Neah Bay area where you can purchase a permit. 
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,"A Nice, Easy Hike for Great Views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful hike to an even more beautiful outlook.  It is an easy hike.  Not a lot of elevation and mainly boardwalk. Some parts do have dirt paths with tree roots, so could be a trip hazard if you're unsteady on your feet.  "
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,This was super awesome!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A must see for those traveling by. The trail is slippery in some areas due to mud and roots but very doable. The trail heads out to the point it’s about a mile and a half round trip with a great viewing point at the end and on the way. On a clear day you can see the lighthouse. The indigenous people in the area left walking sticks to borrow or for sale, leave a donation in the box. You can walk this at your own pace with a walker or someone with a disability, no wheelchairs, parking lot is at the beginning of the trail. Along the trail are some lookout points with beautiful views. "
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,Fabulous site!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What an amazing place here on planet earth 🌍. Decent hike down to the overlook. Could be muddy. The day we went it was not. Maybe just a little. I wish people would be more respectful of the land. The tribe does a great job with trail maintenance. People going off trail is not cool. Please respect the land. It’s very nice that it’s dog friendly. Parking area is not huge. Toilets are available.
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,"very nice, scenic hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a hike almost anyone can do.  It's fairly flat with very little elevation changes.  It's very pretty and scenic with a ton of nature and beauty to keep you company.  It's longer than the sign says but not too much.  I believe we clocked it at a little over 2 miles one way.  And it's definitely worth the hike to see the cape at the end of the walk.
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,Whale sightings!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our favourite trail head when we toured Olympic National Park! An easy walk along the wonderfully maintained boardwalk, with such rewarding views everywhere you look. We took the binoculars with us and sat down for 15 minutes at the end and were fortunate enough to spot a mama whale with her calf swimming along the coastline."
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,"Short, beautiful hike.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a beautiful, short, in and out hike of a mile and a half. The road in was a lovely winding road on the Makah reservation. Stop at the museum on your way in to town to get your $20 pass. If you forget there is a man checking and selling passes at the drive's entrance. The trail was a steady downhill walk with many photo ops. Much of the hike was on a raised, narrow, wooden platform. There were several off-shoot trails to scenic points. It ends at a raised deck looking out to the island and lighthouse."
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,Worth the hike to get to the most northwestern point of the lower 48.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Don't visit the Pacific Northwest without making your way to the most northwestern point in the lower 48.  The hike out to the point is not overly difficult, but wear proper shows and take some water along.  The views at the end will be worth the hike!  No matter what kind of weather is present, I think this is worth a visit."
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,Gorgeous views await you at the end of the trail (and a view of the lighthouse)!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Don't forget your camera!  You will not be disappointed at the views that await you at the end of the trail!  You'll wind through the forest on a path that at times is dirt, uneven steps, boardwalks and don't forget that you are after all in a forest so those pesky trees sometimes have their roots over the trails as well.  "
Cape Flattery Trail,5.0,Stunning scenery!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The end of the trail is one of the  most gorgeous spots ever.  I’ve traveled to many places around the world and this stunning scenery is among the best. It’s a.nice out and back hike with beautiful scenery along the way.  If you are in the Neah Bay area, don’t miss it!  And also, don’t miss the Maka Museum in Neah Bay.  It’s great, too!"
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Plan accordingly and it'll be a good trip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Jenny Lake gets a lot of hype and I don't think it lives up to it, honestly.  It's a pretty lake, but it's not any prettier than any other lake in the area and the overall activity with hordes of people make it a bit more interesting. "
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Best hike of our trip ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and two kids (ages 10 & 12) took the boat ride across the lake and hiked back. We took the first boat out in the morning to avoid the mid summer heat. It was perfect timing, as the hike took 3 hours. We stopped many times to take pictures and just take in the scenery and fresh air. I would recommend this hike. "
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Great hike to see Hidden Falls at Jenny Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are a 60ish husband and wife.  One of us is a mild jogger and the other not so much.  We took the ferry across the lake and hiked up to Hidden Falls.  The falls and scenery were gorgeous.  The climb to the falls is a moderate uphill effort.  We felt good but knew the additional climb to Inspiration Point would be too much for us.  We did decide to hike the rest of the way around the lake back to the East boat dock/parking lot which is about 2.4 miles of moderate hiking.  There were a lot of rocks and roots and mud on the path and you have to watch your footing.  It also goes up and down and you need to make way for other people so it does take some effort.  I saw people with little kids and didn't know how they did it.  I would recommend this hike as it is a few hours with gorgeous views but do know that it is not for out-of-shape people.  If you are, then take the ferry both ways!"
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Early morning recommended!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived at parking lot around 7:30 on Thursday, lot was already 75% full. Started hike at trailhead going counter clockwise.  This direction allowed for incredible views of the mountains in spotlight of the sunrise, blue skies begins them and the beautiful lake in front.  You know, the views you see by professional photographers.  So many photo ops along this hike as the mountain peak’s angles change as you follow the trail around.  We went up to inspirational point and continued on to the cascade canyon trail.  We hiked this to the fork and back down where we continued to hidden falls and then back to Jenny Lake to finish the rest of the trail to parking lot.  This whole trip was 16 miles but well worth it for out family of six, 44,43,19,18,14,10 years of age.  We hiked in tennis shoes, Chaco, Teva and keen sandals. Took about 7.5 hours but we stopped for snack/picnic/water breaks.  Saw 2 bull moose along cascade canyon trail!  Absolutely beautiful!!!"
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Stunningly Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Jenny Lake was our favorite stop on our recent trip to GTNP.  We went there twice.  Once for the shuttle over to hike to Inspiration Point and Hidden Falls, and the second time to hike this trail."
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Wonderful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Depending on how you do it, this trail can be quite crowded if you sleep late and only take the boat across. Avoid South Jenny Lake area except to walk through. It’s nice but far too well known. Park at the String Lake Trailhead before 9:00 a.m. and enjoy your day. It’s ten km all around the lake but adding a spur up cascade canyon 1 or 2 km will add to your pleasure greatly. Another way to enjoy it is to come I’m October or May. Around each bend of the trail is a new delight."
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Amazing trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiking in Jenny Lake was on the the best hikes we've been on!  We took the ferry ride to and from the trailhead and we're very glad we did.  They said it would have added 2.8 miles each way to hike if we didn't take the ferry.  The ferry ride was $50 round trip for a family rate.  Once there, we hiked 0.6 miles to Hidden Falls - it was beautiful!  Then we did the 0.4 steep and rocky hike up to Inspiration Point and it was worth it.  We then kept going to Cascade Canyon which was beautiful - lots of changing landscape that opened up in a beautiful canyon with views of the snow topped Tetons.  We spent about 2.5 hours on this trail before heading back.  We started at 8:30 am and headed back a bit before noon.  We were told that it gets extremely busy later in the day which we saw when after we got off the boat.  Cars were parked a long way away and there was a long wait for the boat ride to and from.  Definitely get there early if you can, and I'd suggest bug spray as it was quite buggy in the morning."
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5, Beautiful Area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Took the ferry to the trail to the falls and then hiked the southern trail back to the starting point.  Glad we had hiking boots with some of the trail being uneven and steep.  Gorgeous views - would recommend starting early in the morning before it gets crowded.
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Worth the continued trip into Cascade Canyon ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved the boat ride to Jenny lake and enjoyed the hike to hidden falls and Inspiration Point, but the highlight for us was continuing one mile in from the top of Inspiration Point into Cascade Canyon.  We turned around after 1 mile in, we made it to beautiful open views of the Tetons.  Our kids were ages 7,10 and 11 and they did great . The toughest part is up to inspiration point. It was 4 miles round trip, we took the boat both ways . They have a family deal for 2 or more kids and 2 adults for $50 for the boat ride there and back, which we enjoyed because then we spent longer In the canyon. "
Jenny Lake Trail,4.5,Beautiful hike with amazing scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the Jenny Lake trail to Hidden Falls and then to Inspiration Point. The hike to Hidden Falls is moderate. Then next 0.5 mile up to Inspiration Point is more technical and strenuous but worth it for the spectacular views. If you can make it to Hidden Falls, you can make it just the short distance farther to Inspiration Point.  The trail is well maintained and beautiful. We saw a couple of moose feeding at a pond along the way"
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,OMG- The Ledges and Drop Offs- Oh my!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I did not make it very far. I am not afraid of heights at all, but this trail was awful if you have edge-phobia. There are no railings with huge drop offs. I had to turn around after I made it up the stairs and to the first flat area. I did Observation Point, overlooking Angel's Landing with no issues, and handled all of the switchbacks at Bryce, but this was tough for me. Parking is crazy, as we got parked in by people waiting for spots. Someone moved the cones from the area next to the handicapped spot so he could park there. Another guy drove the wrong way down the road to try to butt in and get a parking space. The park ranger came out 3 times in the 30 minutes I was waiting for the rest of my party at the trailhead. She even had to call for another ranger to come help her with the people who wouldn't move their cars. Let's just say this was a stressful place for me!  The rest of my family went on the trail and took photos- good view, for sure! They assured me I made the right choice by sitting this one out, though. Just keep in mind that it seems like an easy one (1 mile total- how bad can it be), but it is challenging if you're like me."
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,Get there before sunrise ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got to the park 30 minutes before sunrise. It was light enough to see and the hike was not strenuous. It was cold but there was little wind. The reward was seeing the sun rise off the far peaks and over the canyon. There was a professional photographer there and he was very pleasant to interact with, no ego. Was an absolute must do. Bucket list item"
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked this 1st thing after landing. We flew in to Vegas from MI and drove to Zion. We stayed at an airbnb called Nama-Stay right by the foothills and cannot recommend it enough. Take a look at my review for that. 
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,The best view of Zion Canyon ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I can’t recommend this less traveled trail highly enough. Just stunning views down into Zion canyon from about 1000 feet higher than Angel’s Landing. If you want the reward of this incredible view without the crowds & the death defying Angel’s Landing climb, this is it! We started at sunrise from the East Mesa Trailhead about 3 miles of dirt road from Zion Ponderosa Ranch Resort. Although a dirt road it is fine for a regular car up to about 1/2 mile before trail head."
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,Wonderful hike with spectacular views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were there on a Sunday. It was very busy but everyone was wearing masks and respectful and patient (I’ve a 5 year old). My kids loved scrambling on the rocks (even if my heart was in my mouth). The view at the end is breathtaking. It took us approx 1.5 hours to complete (rem busy Sunday, young kids and taking in the views). Would highly recommend when you’re in Zion. Was my favorite hike. "
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,Amazing views from the top... one of our favorites,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a big crew of 16 people, ranging in age from 14-57.  We had 3 who opted out early on in the hike up, because they are afraid of heights, and parts of the trail are narrow.  The rest of us enjoyed the sweeping views and the hike up was not too difficult, with the exception of one narrow spot that was a bit icy.  There are several great spots at the top for photos and you should allow time to just enjoy the view and get great pics.  "
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,"Difficult parking, beautiful overlook",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail is really fun to hike, offering many interesting things along the way. The views from the end of the trail are incredible and absolutely worth the hike. "
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,Short and easy but worth it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,If you are looking for a short and easy trail that just about anyone can do then this would be a great one. The view from the top is amazing no matter time of the day but either sunset or sunrise would be ideal. The trail can get busy and the small parking lot across the street from it fills up very quick so you might have to park on the side of the road and walk to it.
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,One of Zion's less crowded gems,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Some stairs, but not too challenging.  Great to do late afternoon or whenever the colors are kind of changing... you definitely  want light and visibility to come back down. You should be fairly agile and if you have kids, they MUST be cautious and careful- but anyone with common sense will be fine.  Not the most epic view in the Park but it's not as crazy crowded and you can get there by car!"
Canyon Overlook Trail,5.0,"Saturday, January 28th midday hike.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I arrived to the trailhead around 1pm.  We approached from the valley, and read that the trail and parking was located shortly after going through the tunnel.  This was indeed the case, and it was fairly busy, so we needed to drive up the road a short bit to find a parking spot.  There is a restroom near the trailhead.  The hike is a lot of fun.  Plenty of climbing.  There were plenty of icy, wet, and muddy spots on the trail.  We did not hike with traction devices, but we do hike with trekking poles.  That helped.  The good thing about that time of the day is that trail is mostly in the sunshine, so there were plenty of dry sections of the trail.  We did encounter a fair amount of people on the trail, but nothing too bad.  It was a fun hike, and a nice end point view.  We would certainly do this hike again."
Flatirons,5.0,Great Hike Close to Boulder,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hiking is very convenient to Boulder (vs. Rocky Mountain National, etc.).   Parking is difficult to score - particularly on weekends one must also pay the meter rates.   The rangers at the house next to the park are helpful to describe routes/trails.  The maps are great, but it's still difficult to navigate at times because the trails are labeled and one has to infer from the map which trails one is on.  The trail is relatively easy and scenic.   It gets more difficult the higher one ascends."
Flatirons,5.0,Pleasant hiking with limited views,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are a variety of trails below the Flatirons in western Boulder. Even the easiest ones involve a minimum of 450 feet of elevation. Many are shaded, providing protection from the sun. Some of the Flatiron loops are under repair and closed for repairs from Monday to Thursday. However, they are open and passable from Friday to Sunday. Parking is tight on weekends, even in mid-October, unless you arrive early. The Royal Arch trail is the most challenging, moderate difficulty trail."
Flatirons,5.0,Great trails and amenities right in Boulder! Prepare for crowds.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went early in the morning on a few weekdays. The parking lots were nearly full by 8am and we selected trails to avoid the crowds. Hiking was beautiful with great views of the Flatirons, Boulder, and Denver out on the Plains. The final few hundred yards back to the trailheads were jammed with people when leaving around 10-11am."
Flatirons,5.0,Great views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We were confused as to where we were supposed to go. We never did find how to get close. We just drove to a roadside scenic view and took pictures. The Flatirons themselves are very cool. I just wish we could have found more informatin about them at a park headquarters or something.
Flatirons,5.0,"Busy, but nice hike",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"At Chautauqua Park, parking is a tad limited & when there on a Sunday pretty crowded, but lots of room, even in the rain. Plenty of room to speed out & picnic. Decent trails to hike & gorgeous view"
Flatirons,5.0,I might have missed something,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The flatirons are definitely an amazing geologic site. that wasn't terribly impressed with the hiking conditions. Maybe it was where I parked. Most of my hike was across the flat land and some was in trees. But despite my best effort I never actually got to the flatirons.I saw the flat irons, I got some great pictures of flatirons. I know point that I actually put hand on Rock. "
Flatirons,5.0,Breathtaking Vistas & Formations,5.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the most spectacular city views in the country. The dramatic rock outcroppings as well as the hiking trails will afford life-long memories.
Flatirons,5.0,An uplifting geological experience worth several sketches in my mini sketchbook!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,It is sometimes rare to note that a geological experience can rate 5 stars without any doubts!  And the amazing view of the flatirons from Chautauqua Park is incredible.  First a little description is required.
Flatirons,5.0,Great Hiking Trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hiking trails. Caught up with some family from the area and did a quick hike. Nice smooth trails with some elevation change and lots of scenery. Mid-March had good mix of snow with warmer sun and made for a good Saturday morning hike.
Flatirons,5.0,Gorgeous,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful area, great for walking. It's a big far/steep for toddler legs, so be prepared to carry little ones. But even if you don't get very far before turning around, the trip to see the park is worthwhile. Great couple of hours of sunshine, fresh air, and hiking for our family."
Ocean Trail,4.5,A must do trail for those able to do easy trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a favorite for us!  Beat Cadillac Mountain.  The views are amazing the trial is easy.  There are several places along the trail where you can sit and just enjoy the amazing views.  There are several places on the drive where you can pull off and take in a view, but if you are able and have the time I highly recommend parking and walking the full trail.  It will not disappoint!"
Ocean Trail,4.5,Beautiful hike-go early if you can,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our first stop in Acadia and a great way to start. It’s a relatively flat hike with stunning views - our 6 year old did well but there is a bit more bumps and maneuvering as you get closer to Otter Cove. Try to go as early as possible since this is a very popular trail, by the end of our hike it was fairly crowded. We found a parking spot in sand beach lot at around 7:30 but even then it was about 2/3 full. "
Ocean Trail,4.5,Stunning vistas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had the good fortune to visit the last weekend in October, and avoid crowds on this popular trail.  We also enjoyed perfect weather."
Ocean Trail,4.5,A easy walk to see the beautiful shoreline,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got there around 8am on a Monday In early October, there was plenty of parking available in sand beach. When we walked the path around 12 pm,  it was crowded. We walked to the shore to see the rocky shoreline, thunder hole didn’t make munch sound, but the shore line was beautiful! We had picnic lunch in sand beach. It was a beautiful day!"
Ocean Trail,4.5,Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Incorporated this into my daily morning walk.  Great views but can get crowded especially when the cruise ships come in.  The morning fog could hide its beauty.  Regardless, it worth a visit at least once.  Even the kids enjoyed."
Ocean Trail,4.5,Superb Ocean Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ocean Trail is one of the signature trails in Acadia . No wonder it is quite crowded. The best place to begin the trail is to start from the Sand Beach parking lot. This place has ample parking but try to get there before 8 AM to get a good spot. The trailhead starts from the parking lot with views of the ocean on your left. There are many paths that lead you to the rocky portions to get a better view of the ocean. You are basically walking alongside Park Loop road. On the day we went to this trail the fog blocked the majestic views of the ocean. We had to visit a second time to get a surreal views . The trail is quite easy for all ages and you get to visit other great spots like Thunder hole, Otter Cliff and Otter Point. The trail is also the best way to get to Gorham Mountain trail which I will cover in an another review."
Ocean Trail,4.5,Great path!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,It was so much fun to walk this trail.  You start at Sand Beach in Acadia National Park and you walk down to Otter Point.  Beautiful views.  Many of places to go out onto the rocks or make your way down to the water if you are athletic and bold.  It takes you right past Thunder Hole.  It is an easy walking path for those who are beginners.
Ocean Trail,4.5,Beautiful Views ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We started at Sands Beach (beautiful) and walked the Ocean Trail to Otter Cliff stopping at Thunder Hole. This is a beautiful easy walk with unbelievable views along the way. There are plenty of places to pull off the trail if you want to just sit and enjoy the view. The Trail is crowded however this did not dampen the experience as the views are gorgeous.
Ocean Trail,4.5,Ocean trail June 2021,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views from the Ocean Trail are beyond anything that pictures or words can describe. June 2nd, 2021 and the weather was perfect at 75 degrees with an ever so slight breeze. This is a very easy walk that follows the loop road south from Sand Beach to Otters Point and a must do for any visitor to Acadia."
Ocean Trail,4.5,Easy out-and-back hike with stunning views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike starts at either Otter Point, or Sand Beach (that has a larger parking area than OP) and is 2.2 miles one way. Several areas to walk off the beaten path to explore the gorgeous views along the rocks of the mighty Atlantic Ocean. Passing by Thunder Hole is a treat, although the area is extremely crowded and is best seen between low and high tide. A great hike for all abilities and ages."
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,Easy to moderate hike on Boynton Trail to see Subway Cave!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Went with my family on vacation aged 50s and 20s. This hike was not very challenging until you get to the cave. I think the entire trail itself is about 6 miles however we did not go to the end of Boynton Trail. We hiked about 2 miles then turned off the trail to get to Subway Cave. We followed a few other hikers up there however there is a large arrow with Subway Cave carved into a rock left by other hikers to show the way so cannot miss it. From there it is about a half mile until the cave and the ruins. Really cool spot to see the cave and the only challenging part of the hike was figuring out the way up to the cave. There are two ways to get up one is a narrow and slide like looking (which is how I got down) and the other is a small climb up some rocks and shuffling across a narrow path. The second option to get up is also where the ruins are with some carvings on the wall which I heard was left by a tribe! Very cool view and definitely would recommend this hike as it is not very challenging and can be done with kids as well.
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,"It's a great hike, but long!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Honestly, all the trails in Sedona are fantastic! If you are looking for a long easy hike with shade and forest, this would be the hike for you."
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,Great Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Views are spectacular. Trail is pretty tough on the body. A little disappointing that there is a resort and some large homes in the middle of the canyon at the beginning with some construction happening, so you can hear resort noise and construction noise which takes away from the ambiance. The “subway cave” is off of this trail, so lots of instagrammers looking to get the perfect shot on this trail. If you actually continue on the trail to the end, it is quite rigorous at the end with large rocks and a very steep hike to the top. Parking was a little bit if a challenge as we arrived by 8 am and the lot was already full."
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,SOLO YOLO!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I went alone and have little hiking experience. I went to the top of the red rock vista and it wasn't that difficult but so worth the view. The flute playing man that hands out heart shaped rocks was there and he is just amazing. Look out for him if you go. This was one of the most liberating things I did in Sedona. I recommend stepping out of your comfort zone.
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,Challenging trail with exciting finish ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked this trail on a Saturday morning at 8 am.  I would suggest starting even earlier.  We parked about a quarter mile down the road from the trailhead but cars were parked much further when we returned at 11:30.  It is a little further from town than devils bridge which is insanely crowded.  The trail is mostly easy-ish with a few rocky inclines.  Lots of shade along the way as well as scenic views.  The summit is amazing but quite a climb at the end.  Hint:  lots of people scale up the smooth rock to get to the top but its much less strenuous/dangerous to climb the rocky trail to the left as well as come down that way.  Im 58 and not in the greatest shape but really enjoyed this hike.  Especially the views at the top - worth the trip!
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,Beautiful hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Moderate length and difficulty in a slot canyon. Only downside is the first 2/3 mile is adjacent to Enchantment resort with loud construction currently. The vista at the end is a supposed vortex. Honestly I did not feel any additional spiritual presence. When I am on a beautiful hike I am always happy, at peace  and usually spiritually fulfilled. Didn’t really notice any difference. Regardless this is a great hike"
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,BOYNTON TRAIL WORTH THE DAY HIKE ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Boynton Trail is a easy/moderate trail that runs 6.7 miles round trip. Most think that easy hikes because of relatively not 10+ slope os un true. You are climbing from 5600ft to 7400ft 
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,Worth the view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of Sedona’s most popular trails, if not the most popular. I would suggest going early around 7am to beat the crowds. The views at the end are incredible. Subway Cave is off of the beaten path and not marked. Due to its popularity, it’s pretty easy to follow. You will see an open area with logs. I missed it on the way, but found it about a mile back from the end of the trail. The end of the trail was quiet with no other hikers, but the cave was pretty busy even early in the morning. I mapped it in AllTrails and it was about 8 miles out and back. Worth the views!!"
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,An enjoyable hike with lots of photo ops!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Boynton Canyon Trail is approximately 7.5m RT if you include the Vista Trail and Subway Cave spur trails, both of which to me are a must!"
Boynton Canyon Trail,4.5,5 Mile Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a great hike. Not so little as it has bit of elevation change but the views are worth the hike. I recommend going early in the day to avoid crowds. Nobody going up at 8:30am and 30 folks on way down..Some switchbacks. Take a pano photo at the top! 
Beach Walk,4.5,Labor Day Weekend Getaway 2020,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"How can anyone go to Clearwater Beach and not take a beach walk?  It is (arguably) THE most beautiful beach in the world....in the USA....in Florida...ok, in the county.  No, it really IS beautiful!  They keep the sand clean and fresh each day.  My wife and I were there Labor Day weekend 2020 and for the most part, most everyone was wearing a mask until they got into the water.  Most socially distance themselves in the water.  Nice experience complete with a beautiful sunset on Saturday evening (it rained Sunday evening at sunset and we didn't get to see it).  Plenty of family activities.  There is a nearby park (near Pier 60).  Good for families, couples and anyone who enjoys the beach!"
Beach Walk,4.5,Great views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sunset stroll or shopping trip. Great walk after a good meal. We've gone from one end the other multiple times. Check out pier 60 on weekend evenings for live entertainment or just walk during sunset. Tons of shops and restaurants.  Beach is awesome with its talcum type sand.
Beach Walk,4.5,Great area to visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Plenty to do, lots to see and plenty of good eateries.  It’s also a beautiful walk.  Places to eat outside.  Masks required at all restaurants until at your table and all servers wore masks. We felt very safe. "
Beach Walk,4.5,This beach has it all,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Clearwater beach is perfect in every way. It is a very deep area so that it never seems crowded. Umbrellas and beach chairs are available. There are even specialized wheel chairs that can be brought on the beach. It is very clean and well cared for
Beach Walk,4.5,"Beautiful sand, can be busy but beach is very wide",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Can be busy but beach is very wide.  Parking can also be expensive, has gone up considerable since 2 years ago.  Restauants are a bit of a tourist trap. Good for people taking a week in a local hotel but otherwise best avoided during the weekend.  Drive over the bridge is very slow. Can take 15 to 20 minutes to get from Clearwater to the Beach"
Beach Walk,4.5,A Beach Surprise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"In Clearwater Beach for a 7 day vacation , and asked about what to see first.  Everyone said , Beach Walk "
Beach Walk,4.5,One of the Most Beautiful Beaches in Florida,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We have been coming here for more than 30 years and we have always enjoyed walking on the beautiful white sand. The beach is firm, and wide, and great for walking. We feel it gets nicer the further north you go because you get away from the hotels and resorts at the south end."
Beach Walk,4.5,Wonderful White Sand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The sand on Clearwater Beach is almost pure white and very fine. There are no plants to trip through and walk through. You can walk along the beach for a long way and watch dolphins if you hit it at the right time. It is disgusting that people throw their trash on the beach. We are not from Florida but as we walk we pick up trash. Sad people cannot pick up what they bring to beach. 
Beach Walk,4.5,awesome sunset,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"great place to visit parking is limited, go early or there is a walk.  there are vendors at night o the pier. you have to pay to fish at end of pier. nice long clean beach. sometime over crowded. white sand."
Beach Walk,4.5,One of the Best Beach Walks!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clearwater Beach is one of the most beautiful, public beaches in the world! It's well kept, always clean, and there are nice stops along the way for cool drinks or a bite to eat. I also enjoy going for a morning run on the beach. It's flat and hard enough that running is doable."
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,Beware of construction ,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Was looking for a nice quiet trip to enjoy nature and shut out the world and was very disappointed. The campground requires a reservation (most parks do now) but what they don't tell you or advertise on the site is that a huge section is under construction. The workers start rolling in with their heavy equipment, trucks etc barely after 6am before sunrise and it's so loud. That lasts all day. I tried switching spots once I realized that so I nicely asked and they told us those spots were taken (once they looked in their system) but we never saw occupiers or a sign tagging it taken (everyone gets those) The park was packed and it stayed pretty noisy but I realize that is not the parks fault. "
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,"Under construction, don’t plan on sleeping in past 6:30",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have visited Petit Jean several times over the past 10 years. October is a very busy month in Petit Jean. I wasn’t surprised to see the all of the weekends blacked out for reservations. My favorite camp section was section B. On the website, section B was fully reserved, I was however able to secure a site in section C. Upon arrival I was very disappointed that discover that section B was under construction. My sole purpose in choosing my site location in section C was for easy access to the restroom in section B, however, this was not the case. It would have been nice it the Website would have stated that the restroom was no longer available. This is not the worst part. Construction crew workers arrived at the site at 6:23 every morning. Quiet hours are from 10pm - 7am. If you plan on coming here and expecting peace and quite, you’re not going to get it. "
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,Father daughter weekend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hidden gem- took my 4.5yr old daughter for a hiking weekend- cabin was AMAZING with a million dollar view at $125 per night. Watching beautiful sunset at the lodge and then seeing a sky full of start (over s’mores roasted on our fire overlooking the canyon) priceless. The trails are very well maintained, the views are breathtaking and the staff/facilities to make it comfortable and enjoyable. People drive from 2 states away to come here and it’s in our Arkansas backyard. Food at lodge was delicious, and it was nice to be able to get a cold beer after a full days hike! All my friends were jealous of the amazing places we hiked and pictures taken- can’t say enough about this place"
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,An excellent park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our first visit to Petit Jean State Park, a very nice park which exceeded our expectations. We were there in early September 2022 in a van and tent. We stayed at site 70. The sites are large, flat and well spread out. The park has a pool which was closed when we were there after Labor Day. Unfortunately, unlike many other state parks in Arkansas, they do not allow swimming in the lake. There is a large waterfall in the park but it was not flowing when we were there to our great disappointment. But it had not rained for a couple of weeks, so that was not unexpected. There are a number of very challenging hiking trails, so be careful which one you select. We found one elderly couple hiking one the valley trails who got lost after 3 hours of walking. They were so exhausted that we gave them a car ride back to their campsite which was several miles away by road. "
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,Beautiful Place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hubby and I spend Labor Day week here. We camped in A loop. By far the nicest campground we have ever been to. Full hookups, many pull through sites and with gorgeous views of the lake for most. We walked around and decided there really isn’t a bad site in the whole loop. Everyone at the visitor center was helpful and friendly. We spent the week exploring trails and checking out the views and local history. We will definitely be back! "
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,Yurt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took our 3 small grandchildren and rented a yurt. It was a great vacation, they played in the lake , we hiked to the waterfall and bear cave. The yurt is reasonably priced and came with a canoe ! We look forward to another trip this summer"
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,Cabin 17,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a review of cabin 17. First off, the park brochure map shows cabins 17 & 18  being set back off the ridge behind cabins 16 & 19. That is incorrect. Cabins 17 & 18 basically share the same fantastic view of the valley as cabins 16 & 19. The same valley you see from the Palisades Overlook. Secondly cabin 17 is listed as a pet friendly cabin. We did not have a pet with us but this was the only cabin available. Other than a slight air freshener scent on the LR sofa and chair, we did not notice any sign that pets had recently stayed in the cabin. "
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,"Beautiful park and Lodge, great hiking.￼",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited  this park on a Sunday morning, early, to hike the Cedar Falls Trail. 2 miles round-trip, pretty strenuous over lots of rocks. We had poles and hiking boots, which we were happy to have. Not much water in the creek and coming over the falls, still nice. Stopped by the lodge for Sunday brunch, but had 30 minutes waiting￼ list, so we moved on. Beautiful views."
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,Relaxing Visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stayed in the Honeymoon suite. It has a full kitchen (pots, pans, cooking utensils, plates, cups, silverware, dish soap included). Satellite TV although we really didn't watch much, we were too busy enjoying the hot tub. Nice bathroom,shower a little small but enough water pressure and hot water to overlook the size. Comfortable King size bed and private deck with grill and sturdy picnic table. Quite setting and amazing views, waterfalls could be seen from the deck. Love the place and we will definitely be enjoying this place again and again."
Petit Jean State Park,4.5,Great experience but keep in mind,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It’s a wonderful state park with trails ranging from 0.5 miles and easy to 12 miles. The outlooks all offer a spectacular view. Go sit in front of Mather Lodge for the sunset colors. 
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,Easy scenic walk on the coast,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very nice walk, quite easy to complete. But not handicap or wheelchair accessible as you will have to walk over some rocky areas that are not paved trail. Not much shade or anywhere to sit. We ended up staying on our way back at the beach at the beginning of the trail, Kapalua Bay beach  Found this little cove to be better than the better known Ka'opala Beach. This small beach has very calm water since it's a cove and is crystal clear with some reefs to snorkel over as well. It has limited space and gets a lot of people from the hotel next to it. "
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,It's been a couple of years since our last visit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"From the Marriott/Whaler's Village, we took the local bus ($1 for seniors, $2 for regular fare) up to the Kapalua golf course.  From there, we walked down to the beach (D.T. Fleming), around the Honokaihua Burial site (ancient, sacred, cultural grounds), along the Kapalua Coastal Trail, and back to the bus stop (route #28) in front of Sea Horse Restaurant."
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,"Beautiful, easy hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this last week with our teen boys.  Beautiful, easy hike, mostly paved or easy paths.  Only a short part is rocky.  Take water as there is no shade and go early to beat the crowds and get parking. Maui is mobbed with tourists now as you will see on some of the beaches you pass on this hike."
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,A Great Free Incredible Experience on Maui,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are several places to access the coastal trail: from the Kapalua Beach parking lot to the Ritz Carlton.  You can stop along the way for swimming, snorkeling, cliff jumping, cliff walks, bogie boarding, surfing or visiting dragon's teeth and the labyrinth.  Parking may always be an issue, however, you can park for $10/day at the Kapalua Tennis Club parking lot across from Merriman's restaurant.  The views are simply spectacular and it is totally free.  You will love all the photo ops available. Bring water because there aren't many water fountains along the way.  Travel lightly because you don't want to have to cart many things around while on the trail.  It is not strenuous although you need a good had to shield the bright sunshine.  Do this and commune with the ocean.  The white water breaking on the cliffs is mesmerizing."
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,My Favorite Activity in Maui!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"LOVE getting to walk the Kapalua Coastal Trail! It varies by the time of day, weather, but it is filled with so many varied beautiful vistas. There is some flat walking, hills, moderate rocky climbing-it has it all. This is a moderate trail that families can surely enjoy. "
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,Stunningly beautiful and easy walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A stunning and easy coastal walk with plethora of picture perfect postcard views across a range of different types of terrain. We went during the evening for sunset and there were a number of people with photographers getting professional photographs taken. One of our favourite activities on our day trip to West Maui.
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,Wonderful sunsets,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s a nice, relatively short, but quite scenic trail that was the most enjoyable around sunset.  Minimal areas were challenging, though I wouldn’t necessarily do it in flip flops.  One of the highlights was dreaming of how the wealthy people live in the amazing adjoining gated communities.  Great trail to soak in the good Maui life."
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,"Rough terrain, the lava is hard on shoes and feet",4.0 of 5 bubbles,We took the Maui bus to Kapalua Beach and walked the path up to the trail.  There are nesting birds in the environ so tread softly and carefully!
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,Stunning walking path!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stayed at a hotel in Kapalua and I couldn’t get enough of this gorgeous path along the water.  It’s about 1.6 miles each way.  It’s especially beautiful in the early morning and around sunset.  Parts of it are more rough than others so be prepared to clean your shoes afterwards.  Definitely walk out along the lava rocks to try and spot sea turtles, whales and dolphins.  You can walk one way on the path and the other way on a sidewalk along the street if you like.  There’s several beautiful beaches along the way.  Love it!"
Kapalua Coastal Trail,4.5,Loved This Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy hiking and so beautiful! We have been on this hike several times. However, most people were not wearing masks. If you love fantastic views and a great walk, we highly recommend. You will walk by beaches but also cliffs that are truly amazing! We saw turtles and whales (February visit). Very windy so dress accordingly and ladies, recommend putting hair up. "
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,"Must see on BI, though it’s changing",4.0 of 5 bubbles,It’s not a legit summer trip to BI without descending the 100+ stairs to the Bluffs. It’s an absolutely majestic place.
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"very nice walk from the ferry landing to the Bluffs (and lighthouse). wear comfortable shoes and bring water. morning visit was great--not crowded, but by 10:30/11:00 it was getting pretty busy. beautiful views."
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,"Long, welcoming clothing optional beach at the foot of massive cliffs.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I took my bike on the ferry for a perfect day trip to Mohegan Bluffs Beach.  The isolated section around the promontory to the right (south-west) has plenty of sand and is demarcated as clothing-optonal.  It is quiet and secluded.  The day I visited was cloudy, so even though it was Labor Day there were few people.  In addition to the sand there are plenty of huge boulders that can provide privacy for those seeking it.  Personally,  I love the freedom to be bare whether or not others are around."
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,DONT BOTHER IF YOU DONT HAVE A CAR !!,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Took us about 3 MILES WALKING from where our ferry was parked to get here. (We were told it would only be 1.5 miles) It is EXTREMELY difficult to get there due to no walking paths. We had to walk on the side of the road in 85 degree heat. Once we got there, we had to walk down 141 stairs to get to the bottom. It looks more like a coast line than a beach. It is full of rocks; you can’t set a towel on the sand without it being uncomfortable. We couldn’t go in the ocean as well because there were sharp rocks under the water. The view was okay; but it wasn’t worth the trek and effort to get there. There was no cellular service at the beach and we couldn’t call a taxi there to get back. There are no stores or restaurants nearby- you can’t even buy water. "
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,Great Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We biked out past the Spring Hill Inn to the trailhead.  Exposed trail so can be hot, hot, hot.  Bring water.  BE careful at the cliffs!  We met a couple whose dog had just gone over and miraculously, and I MEAN MIRACULOUSLY, was uninjured, as was her husband who somehow scrambled down, and back up, to get it.  Pretty setting, Easy walking. You will get some exercise biking out here but wind up with a rewardingly nice mostly downhill ride back to town."
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,strenuous climb,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"To access the beach below the bluffs, requires descending a steep staircase which zigzags toward the sand.  At the bottom is a rope pull which enables one to scramble over the rocks to reach the beach.  In the water are large rocks but the backdrop (the bluffs) are amazing.   The climb back to the top is strenuous so this beach is not for anyone with mobility issues."
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,"Pretty scenery, rugged coast",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented scooters to go out to Mohegan bluffs. You could easily walk or bike. 40 steps down and once you're on the beach a little more rugged to get back to the steps coming up. Definitely for those who are stable and in good health. Lots of people on the beach including families. Have read some questionable reviews about what goes on down at the beach level and did not encounter anything of the kind. I would recommend it for a few hours, include the lighthouse in your visit."
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,Highlight of the day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were on a self guided bike tour of the island and like everybody else we stopped at Mohegan Bluffs. I thought my wife was kidding about the number of stairs to get down to the beach, but nope. It was well worth the effort to see a unique New England seashore."
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,"Unbelievable food, service and drinks right off the ferry",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unbelievable food and service, love to see and old restaurant be taken on by new young ownership and absolutely crush it. Right off the ferry to right couldn’t be easier to have lunch at after arriving or dinner on the way home. Will eat here every time I come back to block island."
Mohegan Bluffs,5.0,"Hiking on Block Island, RI",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you plan to walk from Ferry to bluff there are hills, if you plan on driving a moped some roads are restricted. Definitely need comfortable shoes and water. The day we went was foggy, but still worth the hike. If you don't want to hike, I suggest a taxi."
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,A Spectacular Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a wonderful hike.  We did it in February 2021, so it was about 52 degrees with snow on the ground.  The landscape was beautiful.  We had to cross 4 creeks that were flowing pretty good.  Slippery and more snow on the ground as we went deeper into the trail.  I recommend hiking sticks."
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Beautiful Fall Color along the trail ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took others suggestion and arrived early 6:50am. The parking lot is half full. The temperature is much cooler than the city, so wear layers. It was easy trail without huge up down but it is soft sand trail which is a little hard to walk on. The fall color is perfect display along the trail. At the end of trail, we continue walk along the side rock for half miles, the view is amazing, worth the extra effort!"
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Beautiful forest and red rock hike.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this trail in February and portions of the trail were solid ice and very slippery (about 3/4 mile). My husband fell once even though he was wearing hiking boots. The trail is not well marked (0 cairns) and you’ll cross the creek 13 times. It was a stunning hike despite the slippery conditions . The cliff walls, greenery and deep blue sky are unforgettable. I think this trail would be even better in the spring or fall."
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Get your feet wet - Cool off in Oak Creek - Push past the end of the trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a wonderful fairly easy yet Long Hike along the Oak Creek. You'll cross the creek Many time. The real jewel is past the end of this 'official trail'. Hike past the sign and explore the beautiful formations carved into the rock. Expect to get Wet. You'll have to hike in the water once you leave the main trail. Beautiful and peaceful. As we hiked a significant thunderstorm came though announcing itself with huge claps of thunder and lightning strikes. We never say the lightning, but the thunder was Over whelming.. Pictures cannot do this hike justice. The only wildlife we saw were a couple of crows enjoying the black berries along the creek bank. Round Trip for us was around 7 miles. We were beat."
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Old Reliable,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We first did West Fork many years ago, and it’s the only Sedona hike we do every trip. For the end of this hike, I’d recommend you be ready and happy about walking in some shallow water. Don’t let worries about wet feet cut this hike short for you. We had a round trip total of almost exactly 9 miles, and we more-or-less turned around at 4.5 miles, which is about 0.5 miles after the trail ‘ends.’ Several people we saw out that Tuesday (7/7/2020), went well past where we turned around. We loafed, watched birds, ate lunch out there, and we were out there 4 hours 53 minutes. This trail is not for the crowd averse. We recommend this trail if you like to walk around in beauty. Arrive early. No, earlier than that."
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Great morning hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed this hike since it is different than most in Sedona.  We loved the forest, plants, creek crossings, rocks and canyon.  "
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Best $11 entertainment,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We entered the park at 6:45am. Sign on booth says open at 8am but the nice lady at the booth told us that they are open from dusk until dawn. We did not realize there was an $11 fee (we have the red rocks pass and it does not cover this park)
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Gorgeous scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Opens at 8:00 am,  $12 parking (very limited),  trail is 7+ miles round trip"
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Put this on your bucket list,4.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the nicest and easiest trails except for the multiple streams to cross. Wear water shoes and bring a hiking stick to enjoy the day. One of the most popular hikes so arrive early. Not a loop but you can easily hike in and see beautiful views and then turn around if you didn't want to do the full 7 miles.
West Fork Oak Creek Trail,4.5,Wish I was able to experience. ,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family and I arrived around 10 am on a Wednesday and knew it would be busy. The parking lot was at capacity so we traveled up and down the road looking for parking on the side. On our second pass we saw several cars leaving the parking lot so we turned in. The ranger in the booth waved us out yelling ""We're full and we don't answer questions!"" Tried to explain there were several empty spaces (cars were visibly turning out) but she ""doesn't answer questions."" Ended up going to Slide Rock and got right in. "
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,"BRING GLOVES, rain jacket, layers, waterproof hiking shoes, bear spray",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Awesome hike!  We did it with two kids ages 13 and 15.  We parked at Many Glacier Hotel and walked a mile to the start of the trail.  We didn’t even try to park at the trailhead parking lot.  When we walked by, it was completely full with several cars waiting for hikers to come back to get a spot."
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,"Only go on a sunny day, very steep",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I had seen many reviews with carribean blue water. I'm not sure how much were filters and how much was real. I went on a very cloudy day, so the lake looked slightly blue, not like the pictures. The hike was very difficult. I'm pretty healthy and do cardio workouts regularly. We had to pull over a few times just for me to breathe.                              We continued thinking just a little further to the end, but it kept going. It was 1.25 miles high. My 11 year old thought but was ok and my 8 year old was miserable. We went in September and it was snow cold. My husband and I loved the views from high up on the mountain and we were thankful for an adventure. The lake itself was not exciting on a cloudy day. We loved the Cedar walk water and a turn off. The water there was green and really gorgeous (even on a cloudy day.) If you like mountain hiking, it's warm and sunny, or you really like challenging yourself you might love this."
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,Stunning!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike at the end of the July and it wasn’t open all the way to the top. We caught the 9:00 boat from the hotel across both lakes. According to the guide at the information kiosk, the trail from that point was 4 miles round trip. "
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,Grinning at Grinnell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Start hike early so you finish before dark. 10.4 miles round trip. We didn’t start until 10:30 finished at 7:30 pm. I’m 51, hubby is 53 not in tip too shape but we made it. Recommend taking at least 2 bottles water per person, separate packs and a water filtration system to bring water from glacier lake for hike back. We saw a family of rams, pica, bunnies, squirrels. The view was best I seen in Glacier. Very popular hike. You can cut down the hike by 3 miles by taking the two boats at hotel at Many glacier. It is a popular cruise so make reservations well in advance. These will get you in the park also without a car reservation in case you don’t have that during summer months. There was a wonderful waterfall we passed and got a little wet. We notice some dry riverbeds in August on way up so if it’s spring be prepared for some more waterfalls to cross over. Boots recommended and I used poles. Last 1/4 mile of hike is hardest, straight up with lots of stairs. Take it easy and enjoy it. Well worth the hike! Absolutely stunning!!"
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,"A Grade ""A"" hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We a couple (age 61 and 71) hiked the Grinnell Glacier trail on July 13 (2023).   We stayed at the Many Glacier Hotel and booked the 9:00 A.M. boat tour many months in advance.  The first boat takes you across Swiftcurrent Lake, followed by a short hike over a hill to Josephine Lake, where a second boat takes you across Josephine Lake.   You then hike approximately 0.4 miles to the junction of the Grinnell Glacier Trail and then it is all up for the next 3.5 miles."
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,Top 10 Best Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are no words to describe the beautiful views we saw throughout our entire hike.   Hang in there, the last climb to view the glacier and lake was tough but the views made up for it. Enjoy the  spray from the waterfall it was refreshing.   Bring lots of water, food and I recommend walking sticks.  We are both 50+ and our poles were helpful stepping up and down over the rocky terrain.  It took us 7 hours to complete but we stopped to take pictures,  took time to take in the views and spent about 30 minutes relaxing by the lake  We didn't want to rush through this hike."
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,Stunning hike - no boat included - another bear encounter,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike on June 29th.  Park rangers told us that we could not reach the glacier viewpoint due to snow banks and run-off on last mile of trail.  Regardless, this was our most strenuous hike in GNP on a clear sunny day with temperatures in the 80's."
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,Incredible vies and the end-point is rewarding,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This 13 mile hike from Many Glacier to upper Grinnell Glacier (actually stand where the glacier ends and goes into the first lake) is awesome, but strenuous. Older kids will love it, some folks jumped in the ice-lake. The views during the hike are great, and also refreshing (you have to walk through a small waterfall). When at the Glacier, look up, and see (small) the hikers who did the Highline Trail, and the Grinnell Overlook addition (see our review).  And absolute must; you will be tired after a day long good elevation gain hike."
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,Great Hike - Moderate Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful hike.  Quite a bit of elevation gain.  Recommend you plan your trip well in advance and book your space on the boats from Many Glacier.  The boats will cut out 4 miles of the 11 mile trail.  We were too late in requesting reservations (7 weeks prior to our trip) and had to hike around Swiftcurrent and Josephine lakes.
Grinnell Glacier,5.0,Natural beauty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were able to see the beautiful scenery by air.   The lake was an amazing blue.  Sadly the glacier itself was much smaller than expected.    We were told to come back in spring when more snow from the winter is still around.   
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,Stowe Recreation path,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Average bike path, views are average. Bike paths are smaller. If you are looking to ride the bike with amazing views and better experience definitely Burlington bike path is much better where you will be riding close  to the lake with amazing Mountain Views."
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,Beautiful Bike Ride through Stowe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented bikes from AJ's and enjoyed an afternoon biking down the Rec Path, which brings you by brooks, corn fields (and a maze!), breweries, shops, horses... It was such a nice, relaxing way to enjoy Stowe. The path is paved and good for all biking levels. I went on a weekday, so it was not too busy; I imagine during peak season/weekends, this place could be crowded with bikers, walkers and joggers. Great activity for all skill levels and ages.  It took us about 3-4 hours to leisurely bike most of the path (path is about 5.5miles each way), with stops along the way to take photos, eat ice cream, and sip cider."
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,"Beautiful path for walking, jogging, biking",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This 5+ mile path meanders through many wooded areas north of the main street.   It is just beautiful with lots of places to park, picnic or relax.  Lots of benches allow for people to sit and rest. "
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,Absolutely Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We absolutely LOVED the Stowe Rec Path. We rented bikes from AJ's Bike Shop for 4 hours and did the entire trail (approx. 5.5 miles). The view was just stunning...we enjoyed every minute of it. We also took our backpacks and packed up sandwiches, snacks, and a water bottle. We stopped at one of the picnic areas to enjoy our meal, go to the bathroom, and chat for a while. I also packed my Go Pro so I could videotape a portion of our ride. We stopped and took a dip in the creek and stopped to do the corn maze and pet the goats/calves. And, we just stopped at various point of the trail to enjoy the view and nature."
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,Good views.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an easy path just over 5 miles long with good views of Stowe. Starts alongside the famous church and continues along the river and through fields and woods. Lots of locals walking dogs and going for a stroll as well as tourists like us taking photos.
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,Pleasant Walk along River,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I walked along this trail with our Golden Retriever, who was leashed. Starting at the northern part of the trail, we enjoyed the river and countryside for probably a quarter of a mile."
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,Easy Ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is fully paved trail that runs a little over 5 miles.  The grades are easy and the scenery is great.  There are a number of bridges and the trail tends to be very busy.  If you are looking to avoid the crowds earlier in the day may be your best bet.
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,Stowe is in the Know,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Stowe community is charming to be sure, but it’s also just lovely in every other way too. The Stowe Recreation Path, which wraps around the community in a nearly 5+mile loop, is fantastic and nicely maintained. It’s safe and easy to use, suited for walkers, cyclists, locals and visitors. I immediately felt more peaceful from the first step onto the path. "
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,5.5 miles nice bike trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Scenic ride, along West Branch Little river, starting from behind the church in Stowe, crossing many small bridges, close to restaurants. Suitable for younger kids as well. Good for walking, biking and running as well. If time allows, take a detour and walk on the Quiet path next to the bike trail. "
Stowe Recreation Path,5.0,Always lovely - not too busy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Love it here. We often swim in the water if it is too hot. Bring a mask. We walk and bike. My son sometimes scooters. In the early morning or dusk is my favorite time. Lots of shade so even if it hot the temperature is not too bad
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,A great hike with a big reward at the end,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A bit technical and at 4 miles a bit long.  We stopped at the Maha'ulepa Beach after seeing the sink hole and  Makawauki Cave but were so happy we did this hike.  We actaully went back to Maha'ulepa Beach a 2nd time because if was so beautiful (and mostly deserted) and managed to walk another 1/2 mile of the trail along the beach.  A great way to spend a day in Kauai.
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,Most scenic & enjoyable trail in Hawaii!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After traveling thru the main 4 islands of Hawaii, as well as having done this trail twice, I consider this to be the most family friendly and enjoyable scenic trail of all. The Kalalau trail is more legendary and equally, if not more, spectacular but it isn’t as easily accessible and is much more technical. Maha’ulepu trail is easier to reach and can be long (2+ hours) or short (<1 hr) depends on your preference and skill level. But almost anyone can enjoy the beautiful ocean view that is constant and  dramatic cliffs along the trail as well as occasional sighting of turtles surfing in the ocean. We were lucky to even spot a few whales some distance away. Despite only part of the trail being shaded, the proximity to the sea offers constant ocean breeze which makes it soothing and more pleasant. I would highly recommend this trail to anyone visiting Kauai to put this trail on their “must do” list. Highly unlikely to regret it!"
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,Beautiful!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful hike! We parked adjacent to Shipwreck Beach. I think “hike” is too strenuous of a word to use, but a bit more than a walk. You definitely want to wear sneakers. Beautiful views of the ocean & great vistas. Kids age 11 & 14, one with some motor challenges, handled this with no issues. Do bring water! One of the more enjoyable walks we did this trip. we drove to the cave/tortoise preserve from here."
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,Stunning hike along the coast,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful views at every turn! We loved walking this trail and enjoyed spending some time at the Maha'ulepu Beach, which was significantly less crowded than any other beach we visited. I would say it's a trail that is accessible to most fitness levels, though I would recommend close-toed shoes since there are some rocky spots. "
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,Breathtaking Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Warning first-
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,Very nice walk with ocean views and caves,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed this trail, starting from Shipwreck's Beach and going all the way out to the Makauwaki Caves.  We did it early in the morning (a little before 9 AM), and had the trail mostly to ourselves.  When we were heading back around 11 there were a lot of other people on the trail by then.  "
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,Be cautious after heavy rains,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The day before we hiked this trail, Kauai had island wide rain. We started the next morning just before sunrise at Shipwreck beach to catch the sunrise from the cliffs, then started to make our way through. Absolutely stunning views along the cliffs when you begin. Unfortunately, we barely made it past the golf course as the trail was extremely muddy and we were being eaten alive by tiny mosquitoes that left huge welts. Bring bug spray, and avoid after heavy rain! "
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,Best easy trail in Kauai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great trail. It's described as easy, but that is by west US standards. Any hike like this in the eastern US would be classified as moderate. The trail winds along the coast, including some dangerous cliffs, and a couple places where the overlooks are actually rocks that hang out over empty spaces in the shore. Be careful. Even those in our party with bad knees made it because, for the most part, it is not too steep. It crosses a golf course and ends at the Makauwahi Cave Reserve. I would recommend hiking boots as there are rocks to cross. But again, there were those in our party with sandals that made it just fine. Parking can be tight, as the parking lot is very small."
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,Great family hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We loved this hike! We stopped a lot on the way out to take in the scenery and then walked quicker on the way back with less stops. I’d recommend following the trail closer to the water in one direction. My son said it was more fun and the views are amazing. We were tired after but didn’t have trouble and we’re not hikers. Take water. We had some granola bars and apples too for our teens. Towards the end it goes through a protected reserve and is lined up with a golf course.
Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail,4.5,"If you like to hike, this is a must do!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,Trailhead is near parking at Shipwreck Beach.  we hiked 4 miles round trip to the Makauwaki Cave.  Much of the hike is on lava rock cliffs overlooking the ocean.  Part of the hike is on the edge of a golf course.  It took us 2 plus hours to do the hike but we stopped for several minutes at the cave and listened to it's story from a guide stationed there.  It is a moderate hike due to the footing on the rock.  We saw hikers from 8 to 80!  Simply gorgeous and 2 hours of exercise!
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,Views for days,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is something you should put on your list, the view from the top is breathtaking. I got there first thing in the morning trying to beat the crowds and I succeeded as I encounter some people but it was manageable. Keep in mind parking is limited unless you are planning to hike from the Giant Forest museum. It's 350 steps to get to the top and it's steep and narrow. Some places only one person can pass through at a time. At the top you can get the most amazing pictures and videos but it still wouldn't do it justice. Not recommended for people who are afraid of heights. There are bathrooms at the head of the trail. Watch your step going up and down. Enjoy!"
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,Skip the trail and park at the top for the rock.  Not for those with height anxiety.  And only on a low pollution day.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Trail, not just the rock, leads from the Forest Museum to the rock and is a uphill slog.  You can turn that around by starting at the rock and walking the Moro Rock Trail down to the museum.  The trail is poorly marked at the top and not particularly noteworthy given the many options in the park.  HOWEVER, Moro Rock is unique and worth the time.  A small parking lot at the top of the trail eliminates all but a short walk up the 350+ stairway on the rock.  However, I have a fear of heights and only made it, and I counted, 320 steps up the stairway.  The combination of a short railing and windy day accentuated my anxiety.  And I can tell you, from being in the park seven days and getting up 320 steps, there is no view to admire when the pollution covers the nearby mountains and fills the valleys - as it did for our entire visit."
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,Must see/do in Sequoia National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The views were just out of this world!! I had read reviews about it before I went. I imagined it as a small rock hike with a view. Didn't realize it will be this awesome. Not to be missed in this park. Moro rock hike was the best part of this park. We were a group of 9 people ranging from 77 yrs to 12 yrs old. All of us could climb Moro rock all the way to the top to enjoy the beautiful views.
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,Kind of scary! But very cool,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are into lots of stairs and amazing views, trek up Moro Rock. There are immediately awesome views all around, and the formation itself is really neat. The steps are solid but the railings feel quite low in places. I stayed to the inside and tried not to look down in many places; if you have little kids you might feel a bit nervous. It is a short and satisfying hike though; you can see 360 degrees and miles and miles from the top!"
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,A must do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A real must do experience if visiting sequoia. My young kids could not stop talking about it afterwards. doable 300+ steps to unforgettable amazing 360 degree panoramas of the sierras from all angles. An experience e not to miss. check out nearby tunnel log as well when done.
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,Majestic giant rock formation  with spectacular views.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Moro Rock is located at the center of Sequoia National Park. It has an exhilarating view  from all directions.  It is a  challenging experience to climb to its top. 350 narrow steps lead to the top of the rock with a handrails  cable to hold to. Not for the fainthearted person.  A sign on the bottom warns you not to climb on a cloudy day or when lightning storm is expected. I did not climb it, just watched it from the first few steps.  The view was awesome."
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,Sunrise Hike with Kids,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My husband and I knew we wanted to try climbing Moro Rock with our boys while in Sequoia. (Our boys are 3 and 6 years old.) We read other reviews and decided that we wanted to get to Moro Rock early in the morning to avoid crowds on the narrow stairs. 
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,"Beautiful at Sunset, not crowded at Sunset",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this at sunset and it was not busy.  I counted 8 cars in the parking lot.  We started to hike the longer trail up and saw a bear.  My family was thrilled I wanted to go back to the car because we knew we'd be coming down just after sunset in the dark.  So we went back to the car and drove to the closer parking lot.  It was beautiful and not overly difficult.  Yes, it has steps but not a lot.  People were outside the rails at the top and others tried to persuade them that this was dangerous.  Please people stay on the trail especially at elevation."
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,Rewarding fast climb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very rewarding, fast climb. There are railings on the stairs, so there's no reason to be afraid to climb it. When you get to the top, you have an amazing sweeping view of the natural beauty below. It is simply breath taking! In the age of covid, you have to be comfortable with people not being able to stay 6 feet apart. The stairway is taking traffic in both directions, and makes it impossible to maintain social distancing. If you are going to be a social justice warrior about it, best not to go! For all others, well worth it!"
Moro Rock Trail,5.0,Must see location,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a MUST see if you plan to do a single or multi day at Sequoia. We walked through the Moro rock trail starting from the Giant Forest Museum. Google Maps said the trail is about 30 min to complete but it took us a hour to the base of Moro Rock. We were pretty tired once we got to Moro Rock. Walking up Moro Rock was tough. The walkways are very narrow but there are areas that it opens up so you can catch your breath. Once youre at the top its an awesome view. Youll be glad you made it. Going back down is pretty easy than going up for sure.  If you plan to walk the entire trail from the museum, its about 4.5 miles round trip.  You can drive to the base of Moro Rock or take a shuttle if available."
Lakefront Trail,4.5,Great for a quick walk,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We only walked a small part of the Lakefront Trail (combining it to the Chicago Riverwalk) but it was great for a leisurely walk during sunset, admiring the views over Lake Michigan. It was pretty quiet and serene, water was still and geese were floating on the water. Good activity to end the day with. Loops into Millennium Park."
Lakefront Trail,4.5,Great paved running trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We ran 12 km along the trail from its starting point in the north of the city to Navy Pier downtown (but you can continue for at least the same distance again). A very nice flat route on the lakeside with great views of the lake and city.
Lakefront Trail,4.5,Great cycling and walking trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rented Divvy bikes and rode from Montrose Harbor down to the Museum District.  The trails are well-maintained, with clear markings for pedestrians and cyclists, and the terrain is flat (thanks, lake!).  Everyone we encountered was polite and paid attention, a pleasant change from the greenways in our city.  Great job, Chicago!"
Lakefront Trail,4.5,"Walk, Run, Bike, Stroll, your views are excellent",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is why I really enjoy Chicago.  It's a huge city but they really focus on the non-vehicular traffic.  This very long and very well maintained trail is an excellent place for outdoor living.  On one side is the city and on the other is the lake.  You choose your speed and method of transportation and enjoy the view!
Lakefront Trail,4.5,Great ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great route which I think stretches 25 miles which is a little out of our comfort zone. The bike lanes were wide well kept and not busy. You have great views of the lake and there are pit stops and parks with benches if you wish to cool down under a tree😊
Lakefront Trail,4.5,Terrific Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,If you want to see a nice view of Lake Michgan you must walk lakefront trail. It is a breathtaking view near the beach.  There are cantinas to get a drink and several bars- we just passed by- not drinkers
Lakefront Trail,4.5,Take you Life in Your Hands,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"To say that it's crowded, especially on weekends, is an understatement.  Bike riding is simply too dangerous.  Even with the new paths, people just step out in front of you.  If you use, use the south end of it that isn't so crowded."
Lakefront Trail,4.5,Great Place for a Warm Day,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was warm when we visited Chicago so anything by the water was great. The Lakefront Trail is really like a grandstand for the lake. There are plenty of bike riders and joggers. And people just sunning on the steps and looking our over the lake. There's a small beach with a cafe near the Navy Pier. And, yes, people who are braver than me were swimming in the questionable water along the trail."
Lakefront Trail,4.5,Best thing in town,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This IS my favorite thing to do in Chicago.  This runs like 20 miles on the shoreline.  It has beaches, breakers, paved paths (for both walkers and bikes) the entire length.  Great FREE way to see the city!"
Lakefront Trail,4.5,A lovely walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A fantastic trail area along Lake Michigan.
Rim Trail,5.0,Favorite hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail runs along the rim.  If you start at the village and head towards Hermits Rest you can hop on and off the bus when you get tired.  Great views all along the way.  Be sure to stop at Hermit's Rest at the end of the road for a look at this historic Mary Coulter building.  There are restrooms, a gift shop and a snack shop here as well.  There are pit toilets at Hopi Point alomg the way which is also a great spot to watch the sunset.  You can also walk the rim trail to the East from the village for more great views."
Rim Trail,5.0,Can walk as much or as little as you would like,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What's great about the Rim Trail is you can pop on it just for a viewpoint or walk the entire length of it if you really want to. It is mostly level with a bit of up and down. There are amazing views of the canyon wherever you go. The areas near the visitor center and the villages are busier, but you can also get away from the crowds."
Rim Trail,5.0,Beware of ice in the winter,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked from the Visitor Center to the El Tovar Hotel and it was a memorable experience.  the views are incredible but since it was January, the trail was cold and covered in ice.  It made the walk treacherous so my wife and I were forced to leave the trail and walk through the woods in several spots.  The trail could also use a few more signs showing the distance to landmarks."
Rim Trail,5.0,Get out of the village,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Rim Trail is an easy way to enjoy amazing views of the Grand Canyon. The most crowded portions are in Grand Canyon Village and near Mather Point and Yavapai Point. For the best experience, get away from the crowds by walking part of the Rim Trail between Hermits Rest and Grand Canyon Village. We took the red shuttle to Maricopa Point at around 8:30 am and walked to Hermits Rest, about 7.6 miles in total, but you can walk as little or as much as you like. Very easy with great views, and not a lot of people until we got to Hermits Rest around noon. The best part of the trail was from Powell Point to Monument Creek Vista, which is a dirt path (not paved) that gets you close to the edge of the canyon, although not too close! The part of the trail between Monument Creek Vista and Pima Point is a paved walk through pygmy forest rather than along the Grand Canyon Rim, plus it’s shared with bikes, so I would recommend skipping that portion. There are restrooms at Hopi Point and Hermits Rest."
Rim Trail,5.0,The Rim Trail is a great way to see Grand Canyon views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Red Line on the Shuttle service will take you to each of the 10 stops along the Rim Trail so the you can see the Grand Canyon at you own pace.  Starting at Pipe Creek Vista and ending at Hermit's Rest lookout point, take the bus or walk between, Mather Point, Powell Point, Maricopa Point. Hopi Point and Pima Point.  It is stunning."
Rim Trail,5.0,Totally wow!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great way to see this American treasure. Great series of hikes with free shuttle service makes this an unbelievable way to see the park. Winter bus service is somewhat limited but still a great way to get out and about.
Rim Trail,5.0,Great Way To See The Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a long trail at approximately 13 miles from South Kaibab Trailhead to Hermits Rest. A large portion of it is paved, but the stretch between Hopi Point and Monument Creek Vista is not paved, narrow, and very close to the edge without guard rails. During inclement weather and after a snow fall, hikes are not recommended on this part of the trail. The Hermits Rest Free Shuttle Bus (Red Line) is recommended for this part of the trail, and one can board the bus at the Bright Angel Trailhead. Check the park's website for bus schedules. Enjoy the wonderful view along this trail. We certainly did. "
Rim Trail,5.0,Great Way to Experience the Vastness of the Grand Canyon,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked from the Geology Museum to Hermit’s Rest as two parents with 14, 12, and 9 year olds kids.  It was an intense 12 miles (we took the shuttle back) with unrelenting incredible and overwhelming views of the Grand Canyon.  The Canyon is so massive that the various viewpoints, while all individually amazing, don’t really differ that much in their experience, so this may not be a really “necessary” hike.  In other words, taking the shuttle through some or all of it, or skipping a viewpoint or two, won’t really detract meaningfully from the experience.  The one downside is that the trail is well maintained for most of the beginning and for the last couple miles to Hermit’s Rest, but is a poorly maintained dirt trail for a couple miles in the middle."
Rim Trail,5.0,Spectacular: go the downhill direction,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Spectacular! We did a short hike of a little less than 3 miles, from the Bright Angel Lodge area, to the main Visitor Center. Spectacular views every step of the way!! But I hope this will help someone: do the hike in the reverse of what we did! The direction we went was almost entirely uphill, usually not very steep but uphill nonetheless. Maybe about 200-300 feet elevation gain. Do yourself a favor and do the hike in the downhill direction, from Visitor Center to Bright Angel. You can always take the shuttle back to the Visitor Center. In the downhill direction, it would be a very easy walk on smooth paved trails, with incomparable views. "
Rim Trail,5.0,Can't Beat This Place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Back here once again. In January and February you can drive the Hermit Road. After that the bus shuttle kicks in and the road closes to most private vehicles. So I waited for a couple of clear, warmer days and made the trip over. Parked at Hopi Point and walked the half mile or so back to the  Powell Memorial where I left off last time. Then back to Hopi and on to Mohave. Views were outstanding. Some snow on ground but nothing serious enough to handicap the walk. Because I had the use of my own vehicle, I returned to it and drove on to the Abyss, Monument Vista, and Pima Point, winding up at the Hermit Rest for a bit of a rest and snack. On my next visit here I'll try to cover the space between Mohave and Hermit on foot. Since you're reading this, you should do something like this, too!"
Artist Point,5.0,Great spot ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I went here very early in the morning to make sure I could socially distance.  It’s a truly beautiful spot. The whole park is great but this area is really nice. Great spot for pictures. Didn’t see any artists. 
Artist Point,5.0,Must do viewpoint in Yellowstone.  Pictures are almost surreal!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As far as viewpoints go in Yellowstone, this is a must do.  The colors and the dramatic falls would be enough for the best visual experience and photo op, but when looking at our pictures with the contrast of the river and the canyon walls, they almost look like professional paintings.  (I don't have an expensive camera with multiple lenses, by the way.)"
Artist Point,5.0,South Loop Splendor ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Artist Point offers up a fantastic view of the falls and canyon. There are multiple views like this on the north and south loop however here at artist point you can really capture that iconic image. Plenty of parking and other trails to venture.
Artist Point,5.0,Yellowstone Lower Falls - My Favorite Spot,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Lower Falls are by far the biggest waterfall in Yellowstone, and the 308-foot-tall waterfall is reportedly the second most photographed attraction in Yellowstone, with Old Faithful being first. There are numerous views of the Falls from both the east and west sides of the river and most require only a short walk or virtually no walk at all to get a great view. Over my lifetime I’ve been to Yellowstone 5-6 times, and I think this is probably my most favorite spot. And yes, I know with all the unique spots in Yellowstone, it’s a hard choice to pick just one. We liked it so much that we purchased a Thomas Moran Giclee Print (reproduction that is painted on canvas) that we had framed and hung right above the sofa in our living room. Moran painted his famous view of the Lower Falls (technically from the other side of the river) after accompanying the Hayden Expedition in a federally funded geological survey of Yellowstone in 1871. The painting came to the attention of the U.S. Government and was very influential when Congress considered the Yellowstone National Park Bill of 1871. Yellowstone was established as the first national park in the United States in March 1872, and Moran's painting was subsequently purchased by the government and hung in the US Capitol until 1950. It was then transferred to the U.S. Department of the Interior Museum where it still hangs. The Lower Falls area is located just to the east of Canyon Village campground which is a great place to stay if you are camping. Don’t make a trip to Yellowstone without visiting the Lower Falls. (PaM)"
Artist Point,5.0,Great views ; easy access,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were here in the third week of October 2022. It’s just a short walk to the lookout point where the artist point is located and you can see parts of the Yellowstone Grand Canyon. There were two painters that were doing their artwork painting the landscape of the Lower Falls while we were there. In addition to seeing the Lower Falls you can also see the many colors of the canyon walls.
Artist Point,5.0,One of the best spots in Yellowstone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s hard to find words to describe how beautiful this area is. I had no idea that this existed in Yellowstone and I’m so glad we took the time to see this part of the park. Give yourself time to take in the beauty around Artist Point, you will not regret it."
Artist Point,5.0,Crowded - but worth it,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you can hike from the falls on the south rim trail, do it. But it's long there and back.  We had half our party drive and wait and the other half hiked it. You can also drive to artist point and hike back for about 10 minutes. Great views and you can stop and turn around when the trail gets really steep. "
Artist Point,5.0,Most pictured for a reason,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is a decent size parking area here with bathrooms, and it is an easy paved path to walk to the actual point, like a small park unto itself.  My wife & I enjoyed the views from here.  Different angles produced totally different pictures.  Easy to get to this awesome spot."
Artist Point,5.0,Often photographed view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My favorite view of the River, canyon, and waterfall. It isn’t called Artist’s Point for nothing. It is the image often photographed of the canyon. It changes color depending on the time of day. Morning light is probably the best. But, it is lovely any time of day."
Artist Point,5.0,Most popular canyon viewing spot!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The most popular area to view the canyon and falls that everyone in your party can do. You will get out of the car and right to the viewing area, not much hiking at all. This is also the most popular spot to view the falls and canyon, which it did not disappoint. A must stop in Yellowstone!"
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,Marvelous bicycle ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a marvelous bike ride. In fact, I would rate it as my second-favorite ride in the United States, exceeded only by the carriage trails in Acadia National Park. It's paved, it's tree-lined, it does not have extremes of gradient, and the people (and dogs) we encountered were all respectful and friendly. "
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,What a treasure! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"In the middle of a city you don't expect to find a beautiful place to walk or ride your bike. But this is a perfect spot in downtown Boise Idaho for just that purpose.   Families, couples, and individuals were all in joining this beautiful space when we visited. This is a beautiful spot and Boise should be proud of it."
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,Just so pleasant in the simplest of ways,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stayed at the Grove Hotel and they lent us cruiser bikes. The path is just a few easy blocks away. It was not crowded at all apart from the odd jogger or pedestrians. Just felt good to pedal, get some fresh air and look around. We stopped to return to our hotel right around Garden City, which looked like it would be a great stretch to hang out at on a weekend (it was a weekday). Fun to watch the ""surfers"" on the river at Garden City. We ran out of steam but would love to return and go farther one day. Only complaint is that certain stretches/underpasses are under construction/blocked off for no apparent reason and it's kind of a pain to figure out how to go around and get back on."
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,"Great walking path for exercise, but not what advertised",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The city website states that there are many shops and eateries on the Greenbelt, but I did not find that to be the case.  It's a paved path with trees on one side and the backs of buildings or the college on the other.   I was a bit disappointed as I thought there would be more to do than just a path for exercise.  "
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,A must do in Boise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the top riverfront paths that I have been to in the country. It is on both sides of the river and offers a perfect mix of views of the city, campus, and beautiful nature views of the river. I walked this path and used a scooter as well. Both were great options. Would love to be able to spend more time on this! Incredibly clean and fun area with lots of people enjoying nature!"
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,We were SOOO glad we took our bikes to Boise!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved our bike rides on the Green Belt.  It is very well maintained and people are just happy there.  There are walkers, bikers and runners.  We even saw people fishing, paddle boarding and surfing!  So much fun and it's just simply beautiful everywhere.  It is a very safe place to be and you never have to cross roads.  There are bridges and tunnels everywhere so that you don't have to!  There are no difficult hills, climbs, etc.  It was easy riding.  We stopped at several places of interest and learned so much about the city.   Always take bikes when you travel to Boise!"
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,A nice shared bike/pedestrian path,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We started by Boise State college.  The path had some noticeable repairs.  There were both pedestrians and bicyclists enjoying the brisk autumn weather.  The crowds thinned out as we passed the golf course.  My favorite part is past Harris Ranch as you rode by the river.  There were a few fishermen and the river was low.  We stopped along the way to rest and read some of the information along the path.  We even rode during the short hail storm.  It was almost 20 miles round trip to Lucky Peak.  Their bathrooms are closed until spring.  
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,Great place to walk or bike along the Boise river,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My only complaint is that is is becoming more of a bike path and less of a pedestrian place.  It’s Frustrating how the bikes pass and go so fast when there are people, strollers, dogs and families that are trying to walk.  With the explosion of growth I see places on the greenbelt that will need to be widened offering a safe place for people to walk.  "
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,The perfect way to get around Boise while enjoying nature,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed walkign on a portion of the Greenbelt near our hotel.  While strolling after dinner, we saw tons of runners, bikers and tubers enjoying the river.  Gorgeous trees, parks and nature everywhere.  What a wonderful thing for the city to have, and would encourage you to enjoy using it on your visit to Boise.  "
Boise River Greenbelt,5.0,Bevy along the Beltway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Whether you are riding a bike , running, or just taking a stroll, this Greenbelt is safe, clean, and loaded with options for length. Get on and off the trail at any time for shops, museums, other parks, etc. For most of the length, you are listening to the babble of the river, the occasional ""ding"" of a passing bike, or the splash of a dog into the river chasing a ball. I was especially relieved to see so many people following Covid guidelines."
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,Natural beauty with ease!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"From the start at White Top Station to the outfitters in Damascus, the Creeper Trail inspires awe. Natural beauty and landscape give a rich view. Sunbeams burst through the canopy as you cruise your way down 17 miles of converted railroad lending light to the tunnel of trees. Several stopping points to stretch your legs along the way from Green Cove to the small shops along the way. "
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,This trail is a Virginia classic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Virginia Creeper Trail is one of our favorite activities in all of the state.  Their peak time is October thanks to the beauty of the Fall foliage but this is a great ride in Spring, Summer, or Fall.  Even in the hot days of Summer, much of the trail is shaded so it can still be very enjoyable.  You can think of it in two sections.  The top section runs from White Top to Damascus and is almost all downhill.  You will spend as much time using your brakes as you will pedaling.  It's a natural surface trail so you need to be mindful of rocks and ruts but it's a ton of fun to roll downhill through the woods and across beautiful railroad trestles.  The top half will spit you off in Damascus which is a funky little trail town.  There aren't too many fancy restaurants but plenty of shops to poke around in or casual places to grab some ice cream or just rest your legs."
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,Fantastic ride for all ages!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the perfect bike riding experience for my wife and I.  We are 60ish and both in good health but by no means in great shape so the descending trail was perfect.  Weather was incredible, scenery just amazing and I would do it again on a monthly basis were it a bit closer.  I've talked it up to everyone!  Take your time and enjoy the views, the creek/river, the beaver dam and stop in for a mid -trip break/snack at the Creeper Trail Cafe!"
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,Beautiful but too narrow and too crowded,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We (Myself and two sons) rode from the Fairfield Hotel (Which I highly recommend) to the trail. We started at sunrise in October and the trail was very peaceful and downhill from Abingdon to Alvorado. It flattens out until Damascus. From Damascus to Whitetop it is all uphill which we were expecting. it was still peaceful up until mile 23 when the barrage of downhillers start. The entire  trail is very narrow and rocky which makes it hard to navigate people who are out of control and e-bikers who are going way too fast passing people going the same direction like the trail is a one way only trail (the rail is only about 4 feet wide in many spots). We probably had over a thousand downhillers pass us going downhill over those last ten miles to Whitetop mile 33. We were riding about 6 -7 mph due to the near collisions that happened. It took us about 4 hrs from Abingdon to Whitetop.
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,Thumbs up,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We rode the VCT two separate days. First from Damascus to Abingdon. Second, from White Top to Damascus. Rent your bikes in Damascus. Multiple rental places in Damascus. The bike shop on Pecan St in Abingdon charged $99 for two comfort bikes. The Shuttle Shack in Damascus charged $66 for two comfort bikes and two bottled waters. Everyone along the trail and between these two towns are extremely nice, helpful, kind. We will return, definitely. Reserve your bike rental prior to leaving."
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,Fun day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was so much fun!  Beautiful not crowded. I enjoyed the whole day. It took us around 5 hours we stopped maybe every hour. 
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,Great fun for the family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved this ride. It was so easy to ride. My 8 year old was able to ride her own bike. the views are beautiful. streams and bridges are set up along the trail.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an easy outdoor activity in the mountains. Never found the restaurant with the chocolate cake, though. "
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,A great experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rode from Whitetop to Damascus on Labor Day weekend and we were worried it would be too crowded to enjoy but it was FINE. Only one guy stopped his bike across the trail- everyone else was very thoughtful when stopping and passing. It’s a beautiful trip and certainly easy as it’s all downhill. I actually had to ride the brake in some places to stay in control!!  It’s really fun but not a paved or even smooth trail. It’s very bumpy and our teeth nearly rattled out of our heads but that just added to the adventure. You really just hold on to the handlebars, point yourself down, and go!!  Lots of scenic spots to play in the river and the bridges are super cool. The whole thing is an old railroad trail and there are old cars and historic stuff to see. Definitely a “must do” in VA. "
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,Nicely Shaded,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed a delightful 8 mile out-and-back walk from the Welcome Center on Green Springs Road. The weather was perfect, the trail conditions and signage were first class, the route was shaded, and the three-dozen others we encountered were friendly. Most dogs were leashed."
Virginia Creeper Trail,5.0,Rails to Trails Success Story,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This stunning 35 mile trail features beautiful vistas through the rolling hills of Virginia crossing the Appalachian trail.  The trail was a former railroad for the regionally famous engine - Virginia Creeper, which one can see in Abingdon.  There are several restored trestles throughout the hike and many beautiful streams that one bridges as you take in the sites and sounds of Virginia’s backcountry.  "
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,Wonderful Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this trail starting at Sunrise Point and ending in Sunset point and I'm really glad we did it. It gave us a full view of the amphitheater, took us down into the canyons, amongst the hoodoos, into the woods, and back up to the rim. I hiked it with my 65 year old mom and felt it was good for anyone in reasonable health and ability. Of course bring sunscreen, a hat, water, and snacks."
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,Start your hike at Sunrise Point trust me you will be glad you did unless of course you have visited and hiked previouly,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The very kind park ranger at the entrance gate suggested starting our hike at Sunrise point and ending at Sunset point.  We were very glad we followed her advice, as the descent into the canyon from Sunrise was not too bad.  Once at the bottom, we thoroughly enjoyed being amongst the pines.  Marveling at the views and walls and hoodoos from the ground up is amazing.  We followed the trail to Queens garden and then up and out through Navajo..  What waited for us on the trail up and out was Wall Street.  Words cannot describe this section.  I felt like we were in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade movie set in the Sinai.  Just amazing and going up and out to Sunset point was, we felt much easier especially with the added bonus of Wall Street on the way.  I think if you go the other way (Sunset to Sunrise) you get the surprises way too quickly.  Just my opinion of course.  "
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,Our best and most fun hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked our car at sunset point at 7:15am and there might have been 20 cars parked (Sunday morning). There was plenty of parking. After enjoying the breath taking views we started our hike around 7:40am in a clockwise direction. The descent was gradual and very easy. What a beautiful hike on a cool morning Sunday. We’ve been on plenty of hikes, none like this. Every turn and switchback offered something new. You’ve got to do both the queen and Navajo loop trails. Unfortunately for us, Wall Street was washed out so we couldn’t add that hike but that was our plan. If traveling clockwise, the last 25 min of the hike is steep. We are all in good shape and went slow and steady while taking pics to rest and did just fine.  Folks with hip and knee issues might want to use hiking sticks to help get up the trail. We brought enough water and snacks to get us thru. Took about 1:36 to finish. Would have been longer with Wall Street. Very easy and enjoyable hike. If it was closer to our vrbo we’d have done it again."
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,The heart of the park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did the loop starting at Sunset Point, went along the Rim Trail to Sunrise Point, at which point we turned down into the canyon on the Queen's Garden Trail. We followed this trail through to the the Queen's Garden Spur, checked out the garden (awesome) and finished by hiking down to the junction of the Navajo Trail which we took back up to the rim at Sunset Point. A couple of comments on the trail."
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,Tough but Worth It!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started at Sunrise Point and ending at Sunset Point, where we then walked back to the Sunrise parking lot along the paved path. Totally blew us away. It definitely wasn’t easy with the inclines/stairs but totally worth it!!"
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,Great Hike in Bryce Canyon!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Amazing hike!! Went through to the Navajo Loop then it turned into the Queens Garden. We hiked for about 4 miles, but we were prepared. Highly recommend bringing tons of water and to have tons of energy (parts contain going up hill with switchbacks and it gets tiring). Overall, adventurous and beautiful hike!!"
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,Other-worldly Amazing!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Incredible hike.  Parked by the horse corral and only one other car.  We arrived at the park around 7:00 pm.  Did the loop from sunrise to sunset point and we only saw a couple of other groups.  We went to Inspiration Point to watch the sunset and that wasn't as crowded as it was at Sunset Point.
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,Absolutely stunning ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is absolutely fantastic. Try to do it counter clockwise (sunrise to sunset) as the steepest section will be downhill in the beginning. Getting to see all the hoodoos you’re close was awesome. There is a mix of sun and shade so plan accordingly. Definitely make sure to bring lots of water as it is quite dry. My shoes and legs were coated in dust. Ha! And it was nice to visit this National Park instead of the nearby Zion, as it was a lot less crowded. There were a few times we felt so alone on the trail. "
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,The best hike in Bryce,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A great hike between Sunrise and Sunset Points. We started at Sunrise taking the Queens Garden trail and opted for the Wall Street trail, exiting at Sunset Point. It is a moderate hike especially the switch backs at the Wall Street end. Took around 3 hours. About 3 miles in length. Highly recommended."
Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,5.0,Stunning,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiked this loop with my husband and 6 and 10 year old Kids. Started at Sunset Point and walked over to Sunrise Point and then started Queens Garden. Absolutely amazing hike. The whole family enjoyed it. Beautiful views! Loved hiking in and out of the canyon. Trails were packed down, we all had yak tracks which helped in areas to make things easier. We got to the trailhead earlier in the morning. By the time we were done around 1:15 Sunset Point parking lot was completely full with people waiting for parking spots."
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,One of the coolest hikes I've done,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My son had done this hike a couple times and highly recommended it. I'm so glad we did it! It was fantastic. You start at the rim and walk through the rainforest, then down to the crater and across the ""lava lakebed"". You can see up close how the lava cooled, buckled, sprayed. There are still a few steam vents you can walk to, and the neat stacked-rock cairns that mark the way."
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,Five stars isn't enough!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the most interesting and unique trails I've ever hiked.  Walking across the solidified lava lake at the bottom of the crater is fascinating.  It's a.steep climb down 400 feet into the crater (and 400 back up at the end), but the experience is very much worth it.  One.of the best short.hikes I've ever done!"
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,A Must-Do in Volcanoes National Park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I did this hike early in the morning, right after sunrise, and it was quite the site to behold!"
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,Memorable Crater Hike ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of our favorite hikes we did while exploring Volcano National Park. It’s amazing to be able to hike down to the crater and walk across it. I recommend starting on the right side of the trail and going counter clockwise, we didn’t do this and it made it much harder to follow the markers on the crater. This is a 4 mile loop trail. We wore tennis shoes which were just fine for us but make sure you take plenty of water. I would also recommend going earlier in the day to avoid the heat as the crater part of the trail has no shade, but you do hike through the rainforest to get down and then again to come back up. This is a must hike while visiting the park!"
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,Unique experience and one highlight of our trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fairly easy hike for young and old - tennis shoes, sunglasses, light jacket in case of rain, and a bottle of water and you're all set. I recommend starting on the right side of the trail and going counter clockwise, we didn’t do this and it made it much harder to follow the markers on the climb back up. Either way works though. Very little elevation change ~400 ft. We went on an overcast day so it was very comfortable - I can imagine a sunny day could get quite hot down there."
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,Worth Waking Up Early For,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great easy hike and a definite highlight of Volcanoes National Park! I started the hike around 7 AM and was the only person on the trail until the very end. Highly recommend starting as early as possible (especially if you're staying in Volcano) to avoid the crowds and the heat. Walking across the crater is surreal and gives you a whole new perspective on the size and power of volcanoes. As others have mentioned, follow the stacks of rocks placed along the crater to find the trail on the other side."
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,Once in a lifetime adventure!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely amazing hike!!  There are several shorter hikes with great views, but the main hike makes a loop through the middle of a volcano crater. It’s stunning and such a neat experience. We went at around 3:30 pm and the light was perfect for photos. Such a terrific activity - great time and great memories!"
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,Walk across what's left of the 1959 lava lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This travel can be circumnavigated in either direction. We read its best to hike counter-clockwise, and yet we were disoriented and followed the trail clockwise. Doesn't matter. Coming from Colorado, hiking a nearly 4-mile trail at 4000 ft through forest and caldera was not particularly difficult. There are somewhat steep, but shaded steps carved into the first mile or so of the trail, with 15 markers (be sure to grab the corresponding booklet at the visitor center) along the path describing flora, fauna, and volcano attributes (e.g., crater rim, steam vents, lava lake migrations). The center mile takes you into and eventually out of the caldera, which is hot, dusty and often uneven. The final mile or so returns you to the shaded forest area above the 1959 lava lake (it took 30 years to cool!) with railroad tie steps and exposed root pathways."
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,Pretty Tiring Hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"You better be in the mood for some exercise if you take this trail. Demanding, takes at least 2 hours, and once you’ve hiked about 25% of it, it becomes the same thing over and over. Too bad there is no way to abbreviate it, because 1/4 of the hike would be very cool, but the whole thing becomes punishing. You are going 400 feet down (equivalent to a 40 story building) on switchback trails, and then a long walk across the crater, and then climbing 400 feet back up (like climbing 40 flights of stairs). This is old lava, so your aren’t going to see any actual volcanic activity. At one place we stuck our hands in and you could feel some hot air coming out, but there isn’t any steam or gases or anything like that. It would be nice if someone dropped you off at the Thurston Lava Tube and then picked you up at the Visitor Center or the parking lot and you could at least cut off a little of the distance."
Kīlauea Iki Trail,5.0,Beautiful hike. Must do if you are in the Big Island,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Its a long hike but definitely worth it. For the hike, you need to be in decent physical shape but not necessarily in great shape.  The path is steep. It took us about an hour to go down the base of the crater and come back up. Along the way, you will find amazing plants. I will strongly recommend to not rush it and take in the scenery. The hike is beautiful. "
Hanging Lake Trail,5.0,Trail is back open and worth it.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Trail is back open. Beautiful trail. It's a hard trail but I as a 38 year old, out of shape, middle aged male not used to the altitude was able to accomplish it. Despite being passed on the trail by people 20-30 years older than me and young children it was worth the challenge. The trail is very rocky but jist about anyone can do it. Take lots of breaks, bring lots of water. I would recommend hiking earlier in the day as it's a bit cooler. It was well worth it."
Hanging Lake Trail,5.0,Vacation Family Hike- summer 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was mostly through forest, but once you arrived at the lake...it was spectacular and worth the hike! The waterfall was worth seeing also. We were 2 families with kids ranging in age from 9 years old to 13 years old and one of the kids is not that into hiking, but everyone enjoyed this hike and it was a very doable 2-3 hour hike round trip (for those with limited hiking interest)"
Hanging Lake Trail,5.0,Beautiful hike ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Make sure you make reservations! You meet at the visitor center and take a 10 minute bus ride to the trail head. The bus ride was awesome and informative what was around you. It took about 2 1/2 hrs to hike up and an hr to get down. was worth the hike! 
Hanging Lake Trail,5.0,"Beautiful, NOT Free, permits & reservations required",4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an absolutely beautiful hike! Easy for kids (10 & 7). But it is NOT free. You will need a permit for each hiker $12 each. You will also have to reserve your spot early. The earliest time we could get was 3 days out.
Hanging Lake Trail,5.0,Come for the lake....Stay for the waterfalls!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A moderately difficult train. Clear marked paths. Beautiful scenery the entire way! about 95% shaded. The last leg up to the lake is the steepest. Recommend good hiking boots!! No mud on the trail it was dry the entire way. After you leave the lake make a right up to spouting rock. Well worth the extra little walk up!! If you want to stand in the falls I would recommend bringing a change of clothes or a towel! We didn't and wish we had!
Hanging Lake Trail,5.0,"Wow, worth the hike. Glad it survived the fire a few years ago",5.0 of 5 bubbles,Awesome hike. Outdoor colorado at its best 
Hanging Lake Trail,5.0,Just as lovely as everyone says!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As the website says, make sure you're prepared for the trail. It's short, but it's all uphill, and sections are steep and/or rocky. Wear good shoes, bring a water bottle, and catch your breath whenever you need to."
Hanging Lake Trail,5.0,Just do it! Bring water and snacks!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was well worth the hike up the mountain.  I hiked this with two 9 year olds, two CrossFit athletes, a 20 year old man and my husband. I am a 42 year old mom, I walk and do strength training 1-2 times week and I rate this hike has challenging, but totally doable.  However, if you have not worked out your legs or taken a good brisk walk in some time, you might rate this as difficult. Moms out there, plan to bring water, snacks and layers of clothing if hiking in the winter. We got hot going up there in November, but coming down I out back on a layer. It is absolutely gorgeous and great workout. I suggest hitting up the Glenwood Hot Springs after so bring a swimsuit. I think we did the round trip hike in 90 mins with shorts breaks as we went up. Highly recommend it!!!!"

Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,Not for the COVID concerned,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Having recently enjoyed venues like Mount Mitchell where people socially distanced and wore masks when they couldn't,  I cannot recommend Chimmney Rock at this time if you are concerned about getting COVID for the following reasons: lack of social distancing possible and enclosed spaces.  We took the shuttle to the base and everyone was required to wear a mask while in the bus. Once out the masks came off as people walked the short distance to either the elevator or began hiking. Knowing that 500 steps up was not our preference, and that masks were required in the tunnel and elevator we waited in that line. A park employee told the crowd a little about the history of the location while limiting the number of people waiting for the elevator going into the tunnel.  What he did NOT tell people is that someone needs to push the elevator button in order to send the elevator back down from the top. This fact was not posted anywhere, and while it seems obvious that the elevator does not automatically descend,  twice the time between people entering was about 10 minutes instead of less than a minute. This caused the line in the tunnel to stagnate, and of course while unsupervised people lowered their mask. Once at the top, people exited through the gift store and snack bar, then walked a short distance to the amazing look out. It would have been so much more enjoyable had people continued to wear their masks as it was impossible to socially distance. Hearing and being in close proximity to a family with three youngsters who were sneezing and coughing, I felt the need to leave immediately. The option for taking the elevator down is reserved for those with medical conditions so we did the stairs, enjoying the view as much as possible with about 80% of the people climbing up not wearing masks, huffing and puffing, and seemingly unaware of how close they were passing to people around them. Yes, the views are stunning and we wore our masks constantly, but if I had known ahead of time what I know now, I would not have gone. "
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,Awful,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a horrible experience. I knew things would be different due to Covid. I knew they were working on the parking lot. However, the first thing I noted was the road in the park was horrible. Very rough with lots of potholes. Upon getting to the excess parking, it was in a muddy grass area. I'm driving a sedan and not a truck with four wheel drive. I had no idea that was the parking situation. They had guys directing you to the parking spot, but the hand gestures made no sense. I had no idea where I was supposed to park and they acted like I was the idiot.      "
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,Not the Chimney Rock it used to be,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Growing up in Western N.C. my family and I would frequent Chimney Rock.  After the final scenes of 'The Last of the Mohicans' were filmed along the (now decommissioned) cliffside trail, it became an even more popular destination for us to take family and friends who were visiting from out-of-town."
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,Very rewarding hikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We traveled to the park on a Monday and it was quiet enough to enjoy hiking at our own pace which was helpful with our 3 year old hiking unassisted. We had the choice of choosing a shuttle or hiking to the top of the Gneiss Cave level. We chose the longer walk down the 4 Seasons Trail and up to the lower Hickory Nut Falls. There was one picnic bench we used to eat lunch just steps from the falls. 
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,"beautiful views - limited trails during COVID, so prepare for LOTS of stairs and climbing",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Really beautiful, scenic views.  There are normally several trails and options to choose from to get to the top.  When we visited, there was some work being done on power lines, so the only trail available was Four Seasons.  This trail is strenuous.  For a frequent hiker, this will be a moderate trail- but if you are out of shape or have problems with knees, etc. - don't take the Four Seasons trail.  It is ALL uphill and there are LOTS of stairs.  Then, once you get to the top of the Four Seasons trail, the options are go right to see the Hickory Nut Falls or go left to get to the top of Chimney Rock.  This requires another 120 steps and then an elevator (or another 500 steps) to get the very top.  Only two people in our group made the trek past Four Seasons Trail.  The ones that did hike to the top said the views were worth it, but it is TOUGH.  Normally (in non-COVID times), there is a shuttle that you can take part of the way.  This would be better for some opposed to taking the hardest trail out there (Four Seasons).  This would give you more access to the peak without wearing yourself out before the first round of steps.  There was a pretty good crowd when we went.  You can tell from the looks of the trail that it's visited a lot.  If you're interested in avoided crowds, go early.  If you want no crowds, Chimney Rock State Park is not your place.  However, the views are beautiful if you go all the way to the top.  Costs $17 per adult in July 2020 to enter the park."
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,Beautiful Views! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I finally made it here after years of wanting to go. I was not disappointed! You can choose to access Chimney Rock via stairs or elevator. Be warned: there are a lot of stairs. I think it's well over 400 and it will definitely give your legs a workout. Even if you take the elevator you still have around 44 stairs to the very top so unfortunately this is not handicap friendly. The views from the Chimney are beautiful though so its totally worth the workout to get there. The area at the top of the Chimney is small though so it can get overcrowded pretty quickly. My advice is to arrive when the park opens. We did and there was only a few people there. When we left about 2 hours later parking was already full and it was really busy (on a Wednesday!) There are other hikes throughout the park so if you have time to spare you should definitely take advantage of them. The hickory nut falls trail is especially nice with a pretty waterfall at the end. I would recommend everyone hike to the top of the Chimney at least once....
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,"Impressive, even with heavy cloud cover",5.0 of 5 bubbles,What a beautiful place. We shuttled (mask required) and took the elevator and still had a good workout hiking to Hickory Nut Falls and down to the parking lot via the Four Seasons Trail.
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,Arrive early,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My family arrive at the park right after they opened at 9am and there were already several people in front of us waiting to get in. Thankfully we were able to park in the lot up at the very top. 
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,"Due to COVID-19, not a great place to visit currently",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you're trying to visit Chimney Rock on a weekend right now, with social distancing and masks, it is not worth going. We tried the last Saturday of May and the single open trail up was completely packed with people who would not let you pass and no one was wearing masks. No one would move to let faster hikers pass and no one tried to keep any distance at all. It was a miserable hike that took about 4 times longer than the last two visits I made with my dogs. Will not be returning until off season, if at all, until we can safely be near other people. It was impossible and unenjoyable."
Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park,4.5,Great workout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Went on a Saturday, and they were only letting a limited number of people up at a time. Had to keep driving around and checking when the gate would open again. Finally got in, and the cost is $17 per person which I think is expensive. Since we ate ice cream while waiting for the gate to open, we decided to take the trail up. I thought the trail was strenuous, and I was thankful for the few benches along the path. It is all uphill, and I wish I  brought a water bottle. Great work out to do that long trail and then finish with hundreds of steps.  The view on the rock was really great,  and I think worth the effort. Nice little shop that sold drinks at the very top. Masks were required in the shop, and hand sanitizer was available at several spots."
Hurricane Ridge,5.0,Great Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our first stop as we were visiting Olympic National Park. It is a long, slow drive up the visitor's center. As the visitor's center parking was nearly full, they were slowing us up at the entrance which made the wait about 30 minutes. The view from the visitor's center offers you stunning views of the Olympic mountain range. Restrooms and gift shop were open at the visitor's center."
Hurricane Ridge,5.0,Beautiful views & wildlife!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hurricane Ridge was our first stop on our few days at Olympic National Park and we arrived in the late afternoon. We were thrilled that the gift shop was actually open (as so many in our national parks aren't yet). We shopped a bit and hiked a few of the shorter trails. It was incredible that from one area of the park you could see mountains and glaciers on one side and gorgeous views of the Strait Juan de Fuca on the other. We saw lots of wildlife, including a ton of deer and a few marmots, which was exciting! The deer weren't scared at all and wandered right into the parking lots and mingled with the cars. Even the drive up to the top were beautiful!"
Hurricane Ridge,5.0,Wonderful views on the hurricane hill trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the highlights at Olympic National Park. We did the hurricane hill trail which provides excellent views of the ridge. The trail is uphill but is completely paved so it's not too difficult. There are amazing views of the ridge and on a clear day you can see the city of Port Angeles and beyond that to Canada. There are also marmots and deer you can spot along the trail.
Hurricane Ridge,5.0,"Favorite Part of Olympic NP, DON'T MISS",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Olympic NP is amazing with so many different things to do, forest, beaches, lakes and mountains.  However, for me, this was my favorite place to visit in Olympic, simply amazing.  We hiked here on our last morning of the group trip.

Hurricane Ridge,5.0,Terrible experience,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Travelled far to get there only to find d out that the park had reached its daily limit of 375 cars.  The daily limit is usually reached at 10 am forest ranger Jane-doe told us.  We only wanted to drive up to the top to take a photo as there is nothingbup there to do.  The center at the top burned down so there are no washrooms or food or drink available.  It would have been nice if the park rangers could figure out how to advertise tgat there park closes down to the public around 10am each day.  Extremely disappointed to have traveled all the way there to be rejected at the gate.  Its unfortunate they cant figure out how to keep the park open to everyone while they rebuild washrooms.  That is alotvof revenue that they are losingveach day. Revenue tgat could be used to fund the building of new washrooms.  Too bad no one in charge can figure that out. We will not be returning and we will be sure to share this terrible experience with everyone we know.
Hurricane Ridge,5.0,Worth going to! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Worth going to! The hike up the trail isn't too steep (if I can do it, most likely you can too). While we were on top of the first ridge my phone ""Welcomed me to Canada"". Lol. That's right! You can see Canada from the top of the trail. "
Hurricane Ridge,5.0,"If You Do 1 Hike in Olympic, go for Hurricane Hill Trail via Hurricane Ridge",5.0 of 5 bubbles,We spent a few days visiting Olympic National Park and came to Hurricane Ridge on Friday 7/30.

Hurricane Ridge,5.0,Sound Of Music ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The view makes you want to run into the wildflower and deer filled meadow twirling around like Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music. Beautiful Alpine peaks, and a few trails for better views. The gift shop staff was super friendly. I give it 4 stars because ever since I have been to Grand Teton I have compared every snowcapped mountain range to them. If you are looking for that kind of dramatic, stunning view you will be disappointed. However, this is one of the prettiest parts of Olympic National Park and you should see it."
Hurricane Ridge,5.0,Awesome hike - moderate intensity,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice paved paths but some areas are snow covered.  Hiking boots best but our teens hiked in their gym shoes.  Moderate hike.  Wear layers.  Wind is cold but when the sun is out it gets warm (well maybe the word “warm” is an exaggeration but with the exertion of hiking it feels warm!).  
Airport Mesa,4.5,Go here for Sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were told by our Pink Jeep Tour Guide, Lucien, that Airport Mesa was a great spot to see the sunset and also get the best full view of Sedona at the same time. It was no joke. It is absolutely breathtaking and there are a lot people who will join you at the top to watch/"
Airport Mesa,4.5,Milestone SUNset,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sunset at the Airport Mesa was amazing about 3-4$ to park at the airport parking lot was worth it, the views were over 180 degrees of valley and red rocks. There are trails to get you away from the crowds, and there are lots of people at sunset!"
Airport Mesa,4.5,Feel the Vibrations,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A short easy hike from the parking located .6 miles away take the rock stairs to the top of the big red rocks. Known for it’s vortex many there had mixed comments on whether they felt it. I certainly felt a peaceful calm. Nonetheless, at the top you’ll get stunning views of most of the surrounding hot spots. Cathedral Rock and Bell rock amongst my faves."
Airport Mesa,4.5,Great for sunrise and also sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Park halfway up at the little parking area and walk up the rock for some breathtaking views of sunrise and sunset. Keep in mind the sun rises in the east and behind some mountains/rocks so don’t expect to see the sun coming up from the horizon here. The beauty is later when the sun comes up over the rocks and “paints” the rocks around you with a beautiful pink glow!! 
Airport Mesa,4.5,"Beautiful views, crowded at Sunset",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lovely views of Sedona, though expect huge crowds for the road and the space if you head up around sunset. While there are two off-road parking nooks along the road, pay the $3 and park up at the top of the Mesa. You'll have a less-frustrating experience finding a park, navigating the people, and it's worth it to not arm-wrestle for parking spaces on the side of a mountainy road. Pack a picnic, and plan to hang out until at least some of the crowd thins. "
Airport Mesa,4.5,Great View of West Sedona!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had read to take a drive on Airport Rd. for some great views... but were surprised to find a scenic viewing deck area with a parking lot.  We paid $3 to park across the road and joined a bunch of people who had gathered to watch the sunset. The sunset was not great that evening, as there were clouds. But we really enjoyed looking back over towards West Sedona where we were staying.  We were shocked to see how dinky the Sugarloaf Mtn looked in front of Thunder Mountain.  We had hiked up to the peak of Sugarloaf the day before and really felt like we had climbed high... ha, ha... relatively, not so high after all!"
Airport Mesa,4.5,Beautiful view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We drove up the road to the Sedona Airport. Halfway up there’s a small parking area with a trailhead. And at the top a paid parking area where the trail to the Airport Mesa Vortex is located. It’s a 3.3 mile loop with views of the rock formations - Bell Rock and Cathedral Rock included. The parking fee is $3 and there’s a booth with an associate collecting fees. When the booth is not manned, there’s a collection box. You are not allowed to park overnight in the lot. There’s also no sidewalk so walking from the top parking lot down to the other trailhead is not advised. Porta potties are available. And there’s a map and information signage. "
Airport Mesa,4.5,Great place to watch the sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although we only went up to the lookout to catch the sunset, it was a perfect view. You can take in all of Sedona from up there. The view is truly magical. "
Airport Mesa,4.5,Wonder views of all of Sedona and Oak Creek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Get here early so you can park at first pull out going up road. There is another lot at the top for $3.00 parking... but it's 0.6 mile down to loop. It can be taxing to finish the loop and still have over half mile uphill climb back to car. (5 miles total) I recommend doing the loop clockwise and early in the day. It gets hot and little shade on the Sedona side. It goes all around the airport mesa. A fairly long but great hike with great views! Take Water and a snack. I wish they would add mile markers, just to keep track of where you are. We were stumped and kept thinking we were closer to turns than we were. Great trail... a few close dropping edges, but not concerning. Highly recommend."
Airport Mesa,4.5,Five Star Rating… However…,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Airport Mesa offers some tremendous views and beautiful sunsets.  If you hike the trail, TAKE WATER!  It becomes very crowded at dusk and free parking is minimal.  Paid parking is only $3 so not a big deal."
Lands End,4.5,Breathtakingly Beautiful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean. You don’t want to miss this. You can walk on the sand or on sidewalk. There are plenty of structures for great views from above. Felt safe, though there seems to be many signs about people breaking in to cars all over the city. Lock everything in your trunk. "
Lands End,4.5,Wonderful Walking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Start your walk at the visitor's center to orient yourself to the area and wild life. I often see hawks here. Walk from the north of the parking lot along beautiful trails. I recommend going down to Mile Rock beach and then on you way back up take the trail to the left to the point with a labyrinth. You will see lots of pelicans too. 
Lands End,4.5,Scenic hike along the coast with stunning views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful location with stunning views!  This is a great place to enjoy nature and get away from the hustle & bustle of the city and crowded tourist spots.   A peaceful hiking trail runs through the forest and along the coast for a couple of miles, just note that it doesn't loop, so plan accordingly.  We took an Uber to the Sutro Baths, hiked the coastal trail and then took another Uber back to Fisherman's Wharf when we reached the end.  Beautiful scenery and excellent views of Golden Gate Bridge offer lots of opportunities for photos!"

Everyone imagines the best view of the Gold Gate Bridge would be from the Presidio, but in fact, on Lands' End, surrounded by forest and standing above soaring cliffs, you get a picture postcard view of the Golden Gate and the Bay in general.  It's just a spectactular piece of Nature right in the heart of the city which begs to be explored."

Lands End,4.5,So much beauty in one hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We took the hike to Lands End and the Labyrinth with my 7 kids ages 3-21. This was a favorite among them all. The hike was pretty easy as we are a hiking family and enjoy that kind of activity. When. you get to the end the kids enjoyed playing in the sand and the surf and spotting sea lions in the bay. the Labyrinth was way cool and all my kids had to walk it to the end. There is also a beautiful picture perfect view of the bridge from here. 
Lands End,4.5,Visit during COVID,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes the large parking lot is OPEN (as of Aug 2020).  We have never had an issue with parking here when arriving before 10am, after 10am you may have to wait for someone to leave but there are always people coming and going.  "

One of the nicest days spent during our stay in the city."
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,A Great Place to Ride Bikes; Not a Great Place for Cyclists,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"It may be hard to beat the number of trails in Hilton Head and they are great for bike riding. So why a middling review? I found the trails varied in width, many were rooted, and there are way too many at grade intersections. At every single crosswalk where a trail intersected a street, my experience was not a single driver would stop for bicycles waiting to cross. Still, if you have a family on cruisers, the trails are perfect."
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,Overgrowth on bike trails.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We travel to Hilton Head Island to ride our bikes on the long trail system. Unfortunately the town of Hilton Head has let overgrowth spawn on their trails. Many times I had to duck my head or swerve my bike to avoid branches and overgrowth on the trails. Inside Sea Pines Plantation they have cleaned up the overgrowth and the trails are fantastic, but you must pay $10 a day to ride inside Sea Pines Plantation."
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,Always rent a bike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the best things about HHI. You can get anywhere by a safe bike path. Great way to explore neighborhoods, places to eat and shopping. Riding on the beach at low tide is a special pleasure. Bit of advice, if wind is at your back it is very easy, but riding into the wind is almost impossible. You can get off the beach and onto a road at any beach access point, found by looking for the ‘beach rules’ signs. Check out the wind in the other direction before riding miles down the beach. "
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,Island Bikepaths are Extensive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The HH Island bike trails has always been one of the bright spots to visiting the island. I think the amount of bike path miles is about as good as one could expect...perhaps connecting the different plantations and beach accesses with one map or navigation tool would be an improvement. 
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,We did the entire loop around...,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did the entire loop around. Trail was pretty well marked and maps were posted along the way. We wish they would have how many miles each trail has. The ride up over the toll bridge (free for bikes) is not for kids or those who have weak legs. No where really to stop in the north end for a beverage, lunch, or snack. It took us 4 hours at a reasonable pace."
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,Biking is at the top of my list in Hilton Head.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We come to HHI for biking and to see relatives that live on the island. There is nothing I love more than riding on the beach on a sunny day with the wind at your back at low tide. The wind is important because we are getting up there in age and with a stiff wind behind you it is effortless.
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,Love the bike trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hilton Head has outdone it with their creation and upkeep of the bike trails all over the island.  We visit every year the week after Labor Day and spend quite a few hours during our week biking, both on the paths and the beach, but mostly the paths.  They are a great way to explore various areas and are very well maintained."
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,Wonderful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There are so many areas that the bike paths take you to.  We have seen so much wildlife - even an alligator crossed the path in March 2020!  
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,Great place to ride bikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I have learned to always rent a bicycle on Hilton Head. I am in average health but most of the island is flat and a bike ride is an excellent way to explore.  My only drawback is I rode to Coligny from Harbour Town and once I got back my body was in protest.  But that is only because of my lack of physical fitness.  But the places you see and can visit on a bike on HHI are worth low price of a rental. And delivery is included.
Hilton Head Island Bike Trails,5.0,Best biking not on the map,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been to Hilton Head many times over the past few decades and usually do a lot of biking.  The past few years we have largely stayed in Sea Pines Plantation and have found many excellent places to ride, the beach, the trails and through the neighborhoods.  This year we chose to stay at the Marriott Barony Beach Resort, which is next to Port Royal Plantation.  Biking on the beach was limited because inlets precluded further travel along the beach and there was no public access around the inlets.  Even though Barony Beach is accessed through Port Royal Plantation, the plantation streets are not directly accessible by road (there is a guard station that prevents non-residents from entering (by car, bike, or walking).  This is not uncommon throughout Hilton Head.  The Plantations restrict entry by non-residents and bike trails do not continue through the  plantations.  Restricting access for biking diminishes what otherwise would be an outstanding place to bike."
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,Too Many People,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the 2nd time my hubby and I did this tour, the 1st time was 2 years ago and it was amazing-so much so that we wanted to do it again.  Don't go on a holiday weekend!!!  It was so crowded we could not enjoy anything.  The traffic was bumper to bumper and when the parking areas got full everyone was parking along the sides of the drive and it was just horrible.  All we did is drive through, toward the end we just wanted to get out.  Very Disappointed."
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,Potential if Done at the Right Time,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This can be an awesome experience if you plan it. Don't do what we did and just go on a whim in the middle of the afternoon. Once you get the nose of your vehicle on the motor trail you are committed, no backing out."
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,"Everything in One Drive - Bears, Views, Waterfalls, History and Signs",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful drive that offers a little something of everything GSMNP has to offer.  I imagine it is amazing in the fall as it was incredible in the summer.  Some portions are closed in the winter.  Again we saw everything here, bears, views, waterfalls, historical structures and even an entrance sign, the only one we could find in NC or TN.  While the forest and views are amazing, the highlight was seeing the black bears.  This is a great attraction for the park."
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,"Scenic gorgeous drive, go early!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A beautiful, one way road that also has multiple trails, including grotto falls.  I recommend going early as traffic gets more congested as the day goes on.  If you plan to hike go very early as the parking lots fill quickly and after that it is only random road parking which is hard to find.  There are out houses at the grotto falls trail entrance, but nothing with running water."
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,There is a Secret Tip in this Review,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The first time we went to the Great Smokies, we missed Roaring Fork.  And that was a mistake.  We saw eleven bears in two days on this lovely and somewhat precarious ride through the woods and mountains.  The road is windy and steep in places."
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,Scary drive,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very narrow and winding mountain road. Most of the way I was in first or second gear going 10-20 miles/hr.  Felt sorry for guy ahead of me whose break lights were always on.  Some people still need to discover benefits of downshifting. Most automatic transmissions allow it.
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,Worth the drive,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We originally planned this drive to get to a couple of hiking trails to see waterfalls,  but when the small parking areas were so crowded we just kept driving.  Glad we did, because there were so many other beautiful sites at the many pull off areas.  Absolutely beautiful, but slow and mainly one way mountain drive.  There were several old homes and properties to see also, similar to what you'd see on the Cades Cove loop."
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,Did not Enjoy as Much as Cades Cove Loop,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We came here on Thursday, 10/7 after driving the Cades Cove Loop.  Got here at 11:45 am and I imagine if you come earlier, traffic would not be much of an issue.  We spent 1.5 hours here and we were done by 1:15 pm.  In a lot of the stops, there is not much parking.  And it was pretty crowded.  The Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail is 1 lane and goes 1 direction.  There are waterfalls and overlooks.  We also stopped at Ephraim Bales Cabin.  The cabins at Cades Cove were more interesting and we also found Cades Cove more enjoyable.  "
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,Alternative to hiking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a good alternative to hiking with small children.  Best part, it’s free.  It’s a 6 mile one way loop thru the Smokey Mountains.  Expect it to last a least an hour depending on how many stops you make.  There are various places to pull over and enjoy the view or see some historic cabins.  It’s also how you hike back to see the backside of a waterfall.  We didn’t do this but it seemed very popular as that stop was very crowded."
Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail,4.5,Nice drive,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We drove the Roaring  Fork Trail on a Monday afternoon.  It was a nice day and while the traffic flow was significant, there weren't any back ups.  Many of the pull offs, however, were full and it wasn't possible to make many of the stops.  We didn't see any wild life."
Kalalau Trail,5.0,Beautiful but Treacherous Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"First of all, you have to have a permit to even access this hike.  I believe you can go online 30 days before your visit and get your passes, but if you wait it's unlikely you'll get access.  The limit is 900 visitors per day, and even at that it feels pretty busy on this trail.  It had rained a lot the days leading up to our visit, so the trail was very muddy and slippery.  This isn't a hike for everyone, but is steep and a somewhat dangerous in many places.  We really enjoyed it, but were behind a woman who badly twisted her ankle at the bottom of the initial two miles hike and had to hike back out on the injured leg.  The shortest four mile hike (2 in and 2 out) goes up about 800' and back down to a small river that you'll need to cross if you want to go further, or you turn around and go back how you came in.  We chose to turn back here as most people were struggling to cross and our permit required we leave the parking area by noon.  If you do want to hike further to the waterfall, that's another four miles and you'll need more than one permit to give you time.  Go early to beat the crowds and bring a walking stick."
Kalalau Trail,5.0,Excellent Day Hike with Beautiful Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you do any hiking at all, this is a fairly easy hike to the river, 2 miles in. If you don't do any hiking, you might find this quite strenuous.  The trail is quite wide, easily marked but with rocks you need to step up and down from.  There is some elevation gain/loss so again, if you do no hiking at all, you will find this tiring. Water is a necessity and you should bring snacks for energy.  We were only doing a day hike but had obtained an overnight permit to hike beyond the river. We have hiked this trail numerous times and wanted to see what was beyond the river.  The trail is infinately more difficult beyond the river. It is much narrower and you are hiking over smashed vegetation/mud instead of the rock trail prior to the river. The views are more obscured by vegetation here as well.  We hiked 2 miles beyond the river till we came to a viewpoint with excellent views of the ocean and coastline before turning around.  You need a permit to park your own vehicle at the beach/trailhead. Since we had a hiking permit, we were guaranteed a parking permit but they are $30. Otherwise you need to take the shuttle to the trailhead."
Kalalau Trail,5.0,Nā Pali Coast is Kauai at its finest,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Please ensure you do your research before heading to Kalalau Trail. In addition to permits required to go beyond the two-mile trailer marker, you must also reserve parking and/or get to the trailhead by way of a shuttle. Visit the Hawaii State Parks website for information."
Kalalau Trail,5.0,"Amazing hike, you MUST do this, good for all ages, caution on high river levels",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family just got back from Kauai. We stayed near the NaPali coast. We had anyone from age 29-64 with us. There is a new rule now where you MUST have a park pass weeks ahead of time before being able to hike the Kalalau trail. We made this mistake and got sent away the first time. If you can’t get a pass, the best way to get access to the park is via the shuttle. The shuttle pass comes with entry to the park which is nice. The shuttle system is actually pretty efficient too. We took our shuttle from Princeville. After arriving, you have a 0.5 mile easy hike to the trailhead. There are bathrooms and a beach with a lifeguard here. If you want to hike, the trail itself is well marked and reasonably safe for the first two miles. It is mainly rocks but is wide and easily hike-able for people of all ages. There are tiny streams that you may have to step over but nothing too crazy. At the end, you hike down to a river. We went during the winter and the river was too high and too fast to cross. I recommend bring water shoes in a backpack to cross the river so that your hiking shoes aren’t soaked. It was at least waist high when we went. There is a small beach that you can hike down to which is nice. Overall, this trail is beautiful. I’m bummed we couldn’t make it to the waterfall on the other side of the river but highly recommend this. "
Kalalau Trail,5.0,Beautiful Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A word of caution this is a hike not a walk so be prepared with plenty of water and food.  My husband and I did the two mile each way hike to Hanakapiai Beach (although beach access was very limited due to waves).  The trail is rugged, with paths that are very narrow with cliff drops, lots of mud / roots to watch for etc. the trail goes up to an elevation of 800+ feet with alot of stair.  We stopped lots to let people going faster by & to enjoy the many beautiful views! It took us 4 hours in total, with lots of breaks.  You need to purchase a park pass ahead of time online to bring your vehicle to the park."
Kalalau Trail,5.0,Wow!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A must do if you are physically able!! This was our 3rd trip to Kauai but our first time on the trail. I promised myself that I would conquer this 4 mile (round trip) hike the next time we were on Kauai and we did!! First thing was to make sure we got our reservation to enter the park 30 days in advance at gohaena.com or you will not be able to go. We would have liked to hike the additional 2 miles to the waterfall but time did not allow us as we started off a little late AND we were pretty beat once we got to the unbelievable Kalalau Beach. This is a strenuous trail with breathtaking views and I highly recommend a walking stick. It helped tremendously. Here is my tip: If you are not a typical hiker, like me, it really helps prepare you for the hike to start doing squats and lunges a few weeks before you go. This tip was brought to you by a 59 year old slightly overweight woman. Lol! Have fun and don't miss it!"
Kalalau Trail,5.0,Perfect rainbow/Stunning scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the first two miles of the Kalalau Trail to Hanakapi'ai Beach early in the morning as soon as the Haena State Park opened and had reservations to park our car.  We had completed this hike many years ago.  Now, there are boardwalks around the taro fields at the beginning of this hike and they were so beautiful.  At the first quarter mile point, we were treated to the most beautiful rainbow stretching from the Pacific Ocean on to the edge of the Na Pali coastline!  It was so beautiful--brought tears to my eyes!  Kauai rainbows are really more intense and dramatic.  The hike is so beautiful with the lush green plants, flowers, the different shades of blue in the ocean!  So beautiful when you get to the stream that flows onto the beach into the ocean!  Had an awesome picnic on the rocks along the beach!  There are no words that really explain just how special this hike really is and we definitely recommend this hike!"
Kalalau Trail,5.0,Best of Kauai,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I really enjoyed this Trail, one of my favorites as you have diversity of sceneries, not an easy one to do but definitely worth hiking. Remember bring snacks and water because its hours of exploring an amazing path and take your time to contemplate every view. Don't forget your raincoat as its most likely to catch some friendly rain in the middle of your hike haha "
Kalalau Trail,5.0,An Absolute “Must Do” ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Kalalau Trail was absolutely stunning...one of the high points of this visit to Kauai. It’s sad that it took a natural disaster to get the tourist traffic under control (it was literally being loved to death) but the way it is now set up will keep the area preserved for decades to come. On past visits we never even attempted this hike because the area was a total cluster; no where to park, hundreds of people milling about, etc. Now you must make an advance reservation (they open 30 days out). If you are lucky to snag a parking permit good for you, there aren’t too many of them available. We opted for the shuttle from the Park and Ride just outside Hanale which includes your park entry. The hike is amazing but it isn’t easy. I consider myself in good shape, play tennis 3-4 times a week, and after a half mile uphill trek I was huffing and puffing! Many muddy and slippery rocks so the advice to carry a hiking stick and wear good shoes are good ones. The views that reward you are worth every step, and 3/4 of our hike we were by ourselves instead of being stuck in a giant pack of people. We only did the 2 miles in and out (4 total) and it took us 3 hours, which included a 20 minute rest at the beach before we headed back."
Kalalau Trail,5.0,Breathtaking - don’t hesitate,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We almost didn’t go on this hike because of all the reviews saying how dangerous it is and how you can’t take a baby carrier with you… and I am a so glad we decided to try it for ourselves. Traveling with a 5 month old has its challenges but with a little patience, common sense and time you can still make it an adventure. We did about 3 miles roundtrip and the only reason we turned around (so close to the beach) is becasue we had a late start, the baby carrier was not a very breathable one, and my body was emitting a lot of heat. Basically we didn’t want our baby to overheat. That being said had we had a better carrier and started earlier in the day we would have kept going. We met quite a few people on the trail with babies of various ages. There are definitely steep parts, slippery rocks, big inclines then declines but just make sure you have plenty of water, time and (what we did not have) a good set of hiking poles. Even though we didn’t reach the beach the views were magnificent and breathtaking. "
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,A Different View from Below,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful, well-kept trail that allows a special vantage point of the canyon and rim.  We headed down, not sure how far we'd go knowing that every 100 easy feet forward represented anther 100 tough feet back.  I took advantage of those we passed by asking them at what point did they turn around.  Just as they're huffing and puffing, sweating bullets and looking like they can keel over at any moment, that's when I  would pepper them with questions.  Amusing, and I also found you get closer to the truth that way. "
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,The pain was worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail was the highlight of our trip.  We hiked down to  Plateau Point and back in less than 8 hours.  We could have done it much quicker had I prepared myself for the hike.  You might be able to go to the 1.5 or 3.0 mile mark and back with little to no training or preparation, but I wouldn’t recommend going past that point if you are not in shape.  If you can’t hike 12 miles on flat ground you won’t be able to do it here either."
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,Nice hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike the same day we did Kaibob.  We only went to the mile and a half mark as we were totally spent from our earlier hike.  Very hot day inside the Canyon as we were told temps were around the 110 degree mark.  There are water stations along the way, so that's helpful.  Kaibob Trail for us was a bit more scenic, so we preferred it over Angel.  Hiking down is easy, just don't forget.....you have to hike back up.....which is the hard part.  Next time we plan to get down to Indian Garden (4.5 miles), tho several hikers we ran into that got that spot, said the payoff wasn't really worth it. Fun hike!"
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,Just do it.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We're older so we knew we were not going all the way down.  But we took our time, saw a petroglyph that another hiker pointed out only about 100 - 200 ft from the start under the rim, and hiked down to the archway in the trail.  About 40 minutes total and returned."
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,Very worth experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Don't let them scare you.  If you're in shape, you can get back up from 1.5 mile marker about as fast as you go down.  After getting back up, we wished we had gone down further.  Extremely scenic.  We got to see some Bighorn sheep so keep your eyes open.  Most easily seen by spotting their white butts.  Early October was perfect time to be at the Canyon."
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,To 1.5 Mile Resthouse,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked to 1.5 mile rest for both sunset and sunrise back to back and it was amazing. Going down is easy but coming back up will put some lactic acid in your quads. Highly recommend taking this semi easy (considering the trip from the rim to the river and back is 14 hours long) hike!
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,Hike into the Canyon...even just a little,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the trail where people head out for the four days of serious hiking and camping into the canyon, and even rock climbing.  But I just found that if you want to go in a 1/4 mile or a mile, it's OK and well worth it.  After several trips to the Grand Canyon over the years I didn't realize that.  Even the first 1/3 of a mile is spectacular and you can do it safely in casual clothes and good shoes (although I did pass a group of ladies in Jack Rogers sandals...Yow. )"
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,Good trail choice,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Definitely do this trail over South Kaibab, particularly if you don't have experience hiking much. This trail did not seem as slippery, and it is also easier. There are also rest stations and water stops (not all are available all year), which South Kaibab did not have. There is also a really nice portion of the trail that is relatively flat about 3.5 miles down and a wooded section. "
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,Be Prepared,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Do NOT underestimate the hike up. As a sign states very accurately 'going down is optional, going up is mandatory' That being said, if you want to completely immerse yourself in the grand canyon, this is the hike to do. You don't truly understand the depth until you start going into the belly and realize just how long it took to go so little. START EARLY, bring water and proper hiking gear, and unless you are physically fit, do not try going down to the colorado river and back in one day. We went down to Indian Gardens, 9 miles rt, starting at 6am and arrived about 8am, hitting about a 1.5 miles every 30 minutes on average with stops for photos. However, the way up took twice as long, about one hour for every 1.5 miles, and by the time we reached the surface at 11:15 am, there was barely any shade left. We were fortunate to have cooler weather for our hike (about 60 degrees at Indian Garden when we were there) but we were still very warm due to the exertion of going up 3,000ft. When we were at Indian Garden, we overheard people asking for directions to the colorado river, which was another 4 miles away, effectively making it a 17ish mile round trip which was far too long to do in a day by the time they arrived. If you're hoping to go down to the river, either spend the night in phantom ranch (which books up far in advance) or leave very early in the morning with headlamps on. We also saw quite a very people in sandals, flip flops, carrying purses and not paying attention to where they were going and what they were doing, and even saw someone need helicopter rescue at Indian Gardens while we were on our ascent. Do not be fooled, this is a hiking trail through and through, and planning ahead for that will save you a lot of agony. Overall, we felt like this was the quintessential experience for hikers wanting to truly experience the grand canyon more than just gawking, but if you're not prepared you will regret it."
Bright Angel Trail,5.0,Not for the out of shape,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of if not the most popular trail that actually goes into the canyon.  First time I was there, I was confused to discover it gets hotter as you go deeper.  Apparently cold does not sink at the GC.  And apparently I was not the only one who didn't realize this.  We came across dozens and dozens of people who looked like they were seriously about to die within the top quarter mile of this trail.  So I strongly advise staying on the rim if you are not in shape.  While it was only about 80 degrees on the rim, it quickly rose above 90 not far below it, and was over 100 down by the river.  If you are in shape for it though, this is one of the best hikes in the west."
Lady Bird Lake Hike-and-Bike Trail,4.5,Not safe and no longer worth your time,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail was once the main reason I moved to Austin and now I won't go near it and I dang sure wouldn't recommend any female travel on it alone. Homeless everywhere! The homeless plague this once beautiful city and the grow in number by the day. I have no clue what the benefit is to the city and its residents to let it turn to trash like it has. Please tell me who this benefits because it's not the homeless? Do we sacrifice an entire city and its safety for the sake of letting mentally ill people suffer atrocities while living on the street? The mayor ""Cabo Steve"" is a joke and literally thinks this is the Austin of the future."
Lady Bird Lake Hike-and-Bike Trail,4.5,Not-so-hidden Gem,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"After 50 years of passing through Austin, I finally had a chance to spend some time and get to know the City.  Walked this trail one evening and it really is an asset to Austin.  Shaded, good gravel surface walking along the lake through downtown.  Made you feel like you were in an European City not a City in the middle of Texas.  Austin has been expanding its trails and it shows.  No wonder people want to live here.  Best way to  experience this trail in the downtown area as a walker is to go down one side, cross a bridge and return on the other side.  If you time this right, you can hit the S. Congress Bridge bats at sunset in the summertime.  Just take a headlamp for getting back to your car.  After work hours it is very busy.  If you want to ride your bike, its best to go during off hours or you will spend the whole time dodging walkers and dogs.  A bell should be required.  Multiple bikes came zipping past without even calling out. As a bike rider too, it seems like it would be annoying to be on parts of this trail in the evening or weekend mornings but definitely would be a fun ride at other times.  I still don't like the requirement to use a phone app to park your car, so we went after hours."
Lady Bird Lake Hike-and-Bike Trail,4.5,Exercise ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Surprisingly Austin lacks walking and biking trails that connect neighborhoods.  I lived in Colorado for a long time and we had trails from the suburbs to the city and from west to East of the Denver suburbs.  It was amazing.

Lady Bird Lake Hike-and-Bike Trail,4.5,"Walking, bird-watching, and more--right in the heart of Austin!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Austin dammed the Colorado River just downstream of downtown to help manage flooding and control stream-flow. The area behind the dam is known as Lady Bird Lake, and really, it's just the Colorado River's natural high-flow level permanently maintained for the citizens (and visitors!) of Austin to enjoy. There is a 10+ mile loop trail that runs along the river/lake with oodles of access points from all around town. Just walk down to the river and take off in either direction. There are plenty of pedestrian bridges to allow you to cross over to the other side and you can either do the entire loop or create a mini-loop of your own by using those bridges. We say birds, turtles, joggers, bikers, walkers . . . and bats at the Congress Ave. portion of the trail."
Lady Bird Lake Hike-and-Bike Trail,4.5,Great try,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This bike/hike trail is a wonderful way to get a sense of Austin, to be near the river sights, and to navigate the lower end of the city.  However, due to the expanding homeless population that lives there, this has also become an area that is difficult to keep clean.While I never felt afraid (Austin's homeless are not aggressive), this is a common issue that many cities struggle to deal with in a humane and positive way."
Lady Bird Lake Hike-and-Bike Trail,4.5,A different perspective on the city,5.0 of 5 bubbles,When in downtown Austin be sure to take advantage of the trails which run alongside Lady Bird Lake (also known as the Ann & Roy Butler Trail).  It can get a little muddy after heavy rains but is a peaceful oasis in the heart of the city.  Be sure to walk across the Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge by S.

It is necessary to watch for bikers who sometimes come whizzing by without any advance notice, but the beauty of the walk is worth it. We walked over toward Barton Springs where there is a pedestrian (and bike) bridge. That area has some nice spots where you can see a lot of paddleboarders and people in kayaks and canoes."

Snoqualmie Falls,4.5,Gorgeous falls!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Snoqualmie Falls offers visitors a place that is beautiful and amazing just outside of Issaquah, Bellevue and Seattle.  The area is quite lovely and there is a nice hiking trail (can be a little tough on some coming back up). The observation areas of the falls offer nice educational information on the falls and the hydro electric facilities hidden beneath the rocks.  "
Snoqualmie Falls,4.5,"Beautiful Falls, Steep Walk",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Snoqualimine Falls.  Is a steep walk, and it can get crowded, and it is lacking in hand rails.  So make sure you have good knees, otherwise just to the viewing platform.  They have a nice gift shop, coffee and pastries, and clean portable potties.  We recommend parking in the paid parking area, its close, the spots turn over quickly, and easier  than crossing the highway."
Snoqualmie Falls,4.5,Good sized waterfall with some nice walks,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took a short detour on the road from Spokane to Seattle and visited the falls. They aren’t any near as spectacular as say Multnomah Falls on the Columbia River but they were worth a short detour. The access is a bit compromised and we managed to miss it first time requiring a u-turn. Parking is $7 (plus taxes etc) and there is parking in both sides of the road (connected by a bridge). On our side, the car park wasn’t huge. "
Snoqualmie Falls,4.5,Not very natural,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The powerplant built on top of these falls, and electrical lines going across the top of the falls take a lot away from the beauty that the falls must once have had.  The area around the overlooks is completely built up, and very busy with people.  Fortunately you can park for free across the road, and take a skyway across to the falls (see what I mean about built up?).  If you or your kids have never seen a large waterfall ""in the wild"", this is a pretty easy one to take in.  You can also see if from below by going a few miles further up route 202.  Again, you are going to have to go past the power stations, but once you get past there the view up to the falls is a bit more scenic."
Snoqualmie Falls,4.5,Nice little hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"About 1.5 mi round trip. You can see it from the top and then hike down to the bottom. It's a shady interpretive trail with blackberries and little signs identifying the different plants and their uses by indigenous people. There is a restaurant, but the wait was an hour so we didn't have lunch there. I wouldn't go out of your way to see it, but it's a nice stop if you're in the area. There's also a little railroad museum in town; if you're into that sort of thing, you could make a day of it."
Snoqualmie Falls,4.5,Place of wonder,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful!  Be sure to allow enough time to read all of the signage along your walk to the bottom of the falls, as you do need to walk to the bottom of the falls - but beware of the walk back, steep and depending upon the weather, can be scorching hot so bring water.  The hydroelectric history here is fascinating, and one that apparently was not friendly to the native Snoqualmie people - an excellent exhibit on the First Nation people is in the Visitor's Center, be sure to take the time to read it.  This is stilk a sacred and spiritual site to the Snoqualmie people.  While marveling at the beauty of the falls and of the trees, wow, try to picture it before the dam was put in, how different it looked.....there are two ""before"" photos that I found, but they are so old it's a bit hard to imagine.....I recommend lunch at the Salish Lodge, or breakfast, or dinner for that matter, depending upon your hiking schedule."

Unless you really want to or need to park in the small paid parking lot, the huge multi level parking lot  across the street works well. It has an enclosed footbridge to get across the road.  Lots of people, but worth the walk to ALL viewing spots. It is spectacular!! Information boards hold lots of historical facts & history."

There are other free lots further down the hiking trail and elsewhere in the park.
Snoqualmie Falls,4.5,Nice day trip from Seattle with an enjoyable hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed our time here on a Saturday in November.  An easy 35-minute drive from Seattle.  Given the time of year we visited and the fact that we arrived by 10am, parking was no problem at all.  There is free parking across the street, or pay parking ($7, I think) right next to the falls.  We chose the free parking and walked across the street using the skybridge.  We spent about 15 minutes up top with the overlooks, and then took the trail 1/2 mile to the bottom.  The trail is not easy!  It took us about 30 minutes to hike each way - and going up required a few breaks!  It was definitely worth it to take the trail down to the bottom to get additional views of the falls.  There were restrooms/bathrooms at both the top and the bottom of the falls.  After the falls we had lunch at the hotel/resort on the premises."
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,The other hike we did,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hawaii has many unsurprisingly nice hikes.  On this trip, we did Ka'ena (reviewed separately) and Makapu'u.  We've done Diamond Head on a prior trip and I wish we could have done Koko Head this time around but the gf preferred more beach time.  Makapu'u is on the eastern coast of Oahu - roughly a 25 to 30 mins or so drive from Waikiki.  As you drive here, there are numerous lookouts and sites so be sure to take it slower and enjoy.  Makapu'u has a free parking lot that had more than enough spaces for that day.  The trail itself is about 30 mins each way and not too strenuous.  It wasn't too steep and we went on a cloudy day so it wasn't too hot either.  The hike was pretty as you see the mountain range to your left and behind you as you go through the trail (which is all paved BTW).  To your right is the ocean.  As you go up and look back, you'll see the road which you come from and Koko Head.  The scenery in Hawaii is always beautiful and Makapu'u is no different.  You finally make it to the end/top and you'll look down towards Waimanalo Beach, the eastern coast, some offshore islands and the lighthouse.  In retrospect, I feel you get more bang for your buck with this hike than Kaena.  Kaena is long whereas this is short.  I would still do them both, however."
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,"Do not rent a-Car, it’s waste of money",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I and my wife took 13/67 bus from Waikiki which took us all the way to sea life park. From there the light house trial is only half a mile of may be a mile away. Easy walk with amazing views of the ocean. We thoroughly enjoyed the walk from Sea life park to the lighthouse trial parking lot. We went there early in the morning by 7 am, the trial was easy and must do for all kinds of people with diff fitness levels. Incredible views on top. While coming back down I did notice that the parking was over crowded and people started parking on roads. I highly recommend people to take. One day “THE BUS” pass for 5.50$. You can use this on any bus / any route in Oahu. The bus also offers rides to most remote destinations you won’t imagine. "
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,Loved this better than Diamond Head,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of my favorite hikes on Oahu.  Beautiful views and not overly crowded.  The path is paved and extra wide so plenty of rooms to pass people easily.  Not much shade so remember your water.  There is no restroom or drinking water available here, but Waimanalo Beach is a short drive (less than 3 miles) and they have restrooms."
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,Steep climb but the views are worth it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived on a Saturday morning around 945am and had to park on the highway which was OK as the parking lot was full. We love to hike and this one was a nice, paved 2.5 mile trail up to the lighthouse. Beware the climb is steep with 4 stop points to give you a story on the view. There is always a very nice cool breeze which makes the hike so enjoyable, lots of people but not enough to crowd you. Bring water and if you need to go to the restroom, sorry there are none or any food joints. FYI....About a mile before Makapuu there is Sandy Beach, turn off there and drive a little bit and there is a bathroom there plus very nice volcanic rock formation on the beach to take some great photos. Definitely recommend for everyone to hike once and the views are amazing!"
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,Long Walk with Amazing Views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked on the side of the road s you turn into the lighthouse parking area. The parking gets quite crowded. Then you start walking up a paved trail. The trail is mostly uphill, but there are many pull-offs and look-outs on the way. It's not a short walk. You are rewarded at the top with spectacular views, possibly some swimming turtles, and a chance to see whales. The whales we saw did not breach, but they blew out of their blow holes and rolled their fins along the top of the water. It was fun to watch for them and learn to spot them. Well worth the walk!"
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,Beautiful views! Well worth doing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did this hike while on a stop using the Shaka guid app and the views were spectacular. Can be tricky to find parking so just hover around until someone leaves (took 5 min wait for us) and bring lots of water (there is no shade!). The hike is on a paved path but it is uphill so I'd still recommend hiking shoes as going down in flip flops might not be enjoyable. The views are well worth the hike and some of Oahu's best!
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,Windy and whaley,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We had a lovely time on this paved trail all the way to the lighthouse. It's a nice walk with interesting views of many bays. We saw whales jumping and splashing. Hot in the full sun so bring some water.
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,Know before you go,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This would have been more enjoyable if we had more accurate information beforehand.  We saw a couple of estimates of the distance, as 1 1/2 miles round trip, or 2 miles round trip.  According to our phone app that measured steps, it was 3 miles round trip.  We are in pretty good shape for 70 years old, but the 1 1/2 miles of a steady uphill climb was more than I expected.  Also, we were doing the North Shore drive in one day, and this walk ate up more time than we expected.  It is all paved, so it is easy in that sense, and we saw lots of strollers at the beginning, but I don't know how many of them had actually gone the whole way.  As someone else noted, there is no bathroom on the trail, or at the trailhead, so be prepared.  We continued to drive up toward the north shore, and in that direction you will quickly come to a beach with a bathroom.  The scenery on the way up, looking south, was pretty but not remarkable, but if you hang on until the end, you see a beautiful view toward the north."
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,High Traffic but Great Views + Whales,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This ""hike"" is more like a stroll with a paved path the entire way - great for tourists but if you love to really hike this might not be your cup of tea. "
Makapuu Lighthouse Trail,4.5,Beautiful view,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail was a lot longer than most reviews about it say--many said this was only a mile long, but I'd say this is closer to three. It was worth it, though! It wasn't crowded when we went and is fully paved, which is nice. I'd go on a day where it isn't cloudy! This is on the most beautiful side of the island, in my opinion."
Angel's Landing,5.0,An overcrowded sxxxfest!,2.0 of 5 bubbles,This is the second time I've hiked Angels Landing. The first time was a 5 star experience in 2011. This time it was an overcrowded hellhole.
Angel's Landing,5.0,Spectacular ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hike with rewarding views! The cables section is currently closed but the hike is still definitely worth it. Great views along the way! Since the cables were closed we went a little further up on the western rim trail and got a few more views overlooking the valley. I would definitely recommend doing this early in the AM when the temperature is cooler and there is less people on the trail. 
Angel's Landing,5.0,"Strenuous hike, but rewarding views ",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail had been on my bucket list since the first time we visited Zion 19 years ago. I never had a good opportunity to take it in several visits to the park over the years. I finally took this trail last weekend and it lived up to my expectations. 
Angel's Landing,5.0,Give it a try even if you have some fear of heights,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For those of you like me  with mild fear of heights (only in extreme situations, not day to day), I’d definitely recommend hiking to Scouts point and checking out the cables. They were closed earlier this summer but reopened (October 2020). I’m reasonably fit and do weekend day hikes regularly  in Colorado. The hike up was scenic, varied, and only moderately strenuous. From Scouts point you still get a great view of the canyon, albeit not the 365 degree view from Angels Landing. "
Angel's Landing,5.0,Rip off,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The new required permit for Angel’s landing is a total rip off. We attended the lottery 3 times and did not get the permit at all. Although we got a negative result, you have to pay $6 every time, so we basically spent $18 for nothing…"
Angel's Landing,5.0,Hiking Angels Landing in the Winter,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the most amazing and scary hikes of my life. Been to Zion a bunch of times in the summer, but never in the winter. this was our first time hiking Angels Landing and it was amazing. The shuttles were running at the time so we didn't get to start as early as we wanted to. Got to the trailhead abound 10:00 a.m. and finished back down around 4:00 p.m. We did stop and take a lot of pictures, but since it's winter and the ground is covered in snow, you can expect everyone will be taking it slower. Especially, once you get to the chains part. There are some sections where you will have to go one-by-one or wait for other people to pass you first. "
Angel's Landing,5.0,Best view in the park but not for the faint of heart.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a vigorous climb to a very special spot. If you are afraid of heights this hike is not for you. However, if you hike just to scouts landing, the heights aren't bad at all. From Scouts Landing to the top requires that you hang on to some chains. It is really safe if you just take your time and be sensible. This is no place for silly selfie antics!"
Angel's Landing,5.0,CHALLENING,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Definitely a challenge. Start early in the morning to avoid as much heat as you can, if possible.  I believe this one is 1,000 ft incline over 2 miles, and it feels like it. The path itself isn't difficult (smooth), but the incline is rough. Our group had to stop many times (take your time!!) and not everyone made it to the top. The views at the top are great, but so are the ones along the way. Don't feel bad if you have to stop... and remember to pack plenty of water!"
Angel's Landing,5.0,Amazing View! Must do in Zion!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We left at 7a and got a St. George shuttle from Zion Guru in Springdale for $40, got to the grotto at 7:15, started hike at 7:30. Beautiful weather at that time! Got to the top in an hr and got down in 45mins. Since Angels Landing chained part is closed, we continued up the trail past scouts lookout for another peak- it was beautiful and there was probably only 4 other people up there! We even saw a condor. Most of the hike is paved so you don’t need hiking shoes. Nikes or tennis shoes will do! Hike was strenuous half of the time during the ascent, lots of switch backs, but doable. Not crowded on the ascent, but definitely passed lots of people coming up during our descent around 9:15a. It was starting to get hot during our decent and we got to the bottom at 10:10a. Timing was great, weather wise for shorts and a tank! It was quicker than I thought! Overall, highly recommend! Great way to see Zion from the top!"
Angel's Landing,5.0,One of our Favorite Hikes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Now that you need to go through the lottery ticketing system, it’s a much easier hike to do than before because it’s not crowded. This is one of our favorite hikes to do in the park. It’s not scary at all unless you have a fear of heights. Best way to get in the park is with an ebike. There’s also a great private guiding service that will bring their ebikes to you and guide you to the top or any hike for up to 6 people for like 150 p/p. It even includes a boxed lunch from a local cafe. Really great deal from ridezion.com"
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,Koko Head workout,4.0 of 5 bubbles,My 11yo daughter and I did Koko Head in June ‘22.
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,Workout vs hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This I would rate more as a workout vs a hike as to me a hike you take in nature as you do it and can also let your mind go a bit and just enjoy the moment.. this “hike” you really have to be mentally on at all times.. one slip or mess up can be pretty detrimental. I can say it was not relaxing at all until you reach the very top. The panoramic view from up top makes the 1 mile vertical elliptical workout worth it. The views are stunning of north shore beach and neighborhoods. It is much cooler/windy up too so that definitely helps bring your body core temp down. We saw a few geckos and centipedes up top too, so be careful where you sit on rocks. Cool military history here!"
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,Must Do!   Not as hard as it looks!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Diamondhead gets all the hype, but Kokohead is ten times better for those who want a little bit of a challenge, amazing views, and a sense of accomplishment."
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,Challenging but worth it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing hike - not for the faint of heart. Get there early to beat the crowd and take your time!!! It’s steep and difficult but we thought it was an awesome challenge with gorgeous views at the top. Definitely recommend if you’re a good hiker. I would NOT recommend going when it’s raining as the stairs get pretty slippery - all the more reason to go super early and catch the good weather/small crowds.
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,Challenging but worth it!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'm not a hiker but in moderately decent shape. This was challenging but very worth it! I did this hike with 3 others, all in our early 30s (vs Diamond head, did with whole family including parents). It took us about 45min up, 35min down, spent about 30min on top taking pictures and enjoying the view. Up is harder physically, down is harder mentally (really worried we would fall!). These are not steps, there are areas where the steps are about 2ft apart and 20in in height. There is ~50ft where there is no ground under the steps. The ""bypass trail"" to get past this requires you to use a rope to help yourself up the mountain."
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,Do it for the challenge!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very doable yet challenging hike. It’s all ascending and steep and there is a section where I’d advise taking the “alternate route” instead of going over the railway. With that said, plenty of people didn’t take the alternate route and you’ll see others literally running up/down without missing a step. If you’re on vacation, don’t ruin your vacation getting hurt. There are plenty of other hikes you want to stay healthy and injury free for. "
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,"Rustic, Challenging, yet doable hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The railroad ties of the old railway serve as steps up the mountain. We attempted it last summer when we were there, but started too late in the morning. So, it was hot, my son and I were both out of shape, and we didn't make it to the top. However, this fall we planned for it and worked out leading up to the trip. The park does not officially open until 6:30 which is right about sunrise that time of year. We arrived at 4:45, parked on a residential street, and hiked into the park along with some locals. I HIGHLY recommend the headband flashlights if arriving before sunrise. We used the flashlights on our phones. We took some amazing pics. Absolutely spectacular. I lost my footing on the way down and took a spill that resulted in some cuts, scrapes, and bruises, and it was still worth it. Initially I resigned myself to the fact that I had simply chosen the wrong shoes for the trek (running shoes). However, on the way down, I was passed by a local literally running up the mountain wearing flip flops and then another who was bare foot. I don't recommend either of those options for tourists. What I personally didn't think through was the fact that the climb is just as steep on the way down as it was on the way up. Reserve some energy for the trek down and do a LOT of stairs or the StairMaster as part of your workout before making this trek. HOWEVER, I DO recommend taking this trek... just start by 8am and you should be up and back down before the heat of the day. "
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,Do it,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great workout - stair master 5000! It's not a 'hike' IMO and you DON'T need hiking shoes like some people here will tell you. Runners are just fine but would avoid anything less like sandals. That said, shoes with at least a little grip will help on the way down, especially if there's any rain. "
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,"A fun challenge, but can be dangerous",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'm a very experienced hiker who did this trail last week for the first time.  I do NOT recommend this hike for kids or younger teenagers, because the downhill portion is so steep that if you miss your foot placement on the railroad ties on the downhill, especially  during the section where the wooden ties are about 10 to 12 feet above ground level, a sprained ankle would be a lucky outcome. The day I did it, March 25th, they were air-lifting a young person I later heard was 12 years old who went too fast on the downhill, tumbled, and broke multiple bones, including his leg. A medical rescue helicopter was hovering for about 10 minutes before they lifted him off the hill. "
Koko Crater Railway Trail,4.5,Railway and Ridge Hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is easy to find, with adequate parking.  Over the years I’ve been coming here, the wooden tyes are now in really bad shape.  They have placed stones and bricks to help with the walk, but the crowds and runners make it a challenge.  No real cover on the way up, but plenty of rest areas.  I found the down just as challenging."
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,Beautiful but very crowded!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited between Christmas and New Years and I guess others had the same idea.  Due to earlier rainy weather, several of the trails were closed.  It was a beautiful hike, though, along the ocean. ""The Lodge"" was built in 1922 as a restaurant for tour buses and travelers. Today ""The Lodge"" offers a viewing room that shows videos on wildlife and the history of Torrey Pines.  There are various examples of taxidermy wildlife on display to show what animals can be seen in the wild.  "
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,"Amazing hike, right outside of the city!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When I visited San Diego for a weekend, I was most excited for a hike at Torrey Pines. The views look great, and going on a nice hike is always great to break up an otherwise indulgent vacation!"
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Torrey Pines has beautiful trails and is very cool.  We just had too little time to explore.  San Diego area has so much to offer it is hard to get enough time at any one place if you want to see everything.  We went on a Saturday and we had plenty of space--it did not feel crowded.   If you want views, space, and hiking, this is a good place to go."
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,A Photographer's Paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a wonderful place to spend a few relaxing hours. There were easy to moderate hiking paths up the hill with fabulous views, beautiful scenery everywhere we looked, and a very rocky beach where we sat to enjoy the fabulous sunset."
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,A must do if in the La Jolla area!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trails are easy and the views are amazing.  We loved this place and were fortunate enough to have easy access from our hotel as we were staying at the Lodge at Torrey Pines.  We did the trails on 2 different days during our stay.  Our first time was on Labor Day in the late morning and it was pretty busy.   We avoided one of the lookouts because it was too crowded, but it was still a great time.  The second time we hiked the trails was on a Thursday in the late afternoon and it was a lot less crowded and really fantastic to have some of the trails to yourself.  Probably the most opportune time to hike there would be early morning on a weekday.  The trails are nicely maintained and certainly easy enough for beginner hikers."
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,Beautiful park for hiking to the beach,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Torrey Pines has trails and beach access for the rugged North County beach in San Diego.    We wanted to go to Blacks Beach and chose the Torrey Pines trails as best option.   There is some free parking along the highway near entrance, but it is always full.   It’s worth the $15 parking fee to drive in and park at the upper parking lot, near the beach trail.   Lower lot near entrance is too far from trail!   We enjoyed the hike down to the beach—-amazing scenery and relatively easy trail with steps and rope rails.    Much safer than the dangerous climb down the cliffs near the Gliderport.   Once down on beach level it’s a beautiful, unspoiled Pacific beach scene.   You can walk south to Blacks Beach, which is clothing optional, but really has few people around.   A peaceful, wonderful place to relax!"
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,"Beautiful, Easy Hiking",5.0 of 5 bubbles,All the trails are well marked and fairly easy. Be sure to go at low tide so you can walk down from the cliffs and have lots of time to walk along the shore.  There was a very proud sea lion entertaining us with his little lion shark catch (see photo) on the day we were there. It was just lovely!
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,Avoid their Parking Scam and Overcharged Fees,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beware of their paid parking to enter the park. They charged my credit card twice for a total amount of $50 and will not refund me. I tried disputing it with my credit card company. Their response was they ""assumed"" I paid for the person behind me, but they have NO PROOF! I was by myself in the car! Wouldn't it make sense for me to carpool to avoid the additional $25 fee?! This experience has really made this spot a sour one. "
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,Best hike ever!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If someone had not recommended me this hike as a memorable experience while visiting San Diego, I’d never have looked for  it. It was a far longer hike than  expected, but once there, totally worth the effort. The views from the different vistas were amazing. The Torrey Pines Lodge Museum (nearly at the top) was small but just right in its offerings. They had an educational video playing in a small room that was very interesting and the people working there were friendly and kind. You could tell they enjoy their jobs and that makes the visit even better. There were real washrooms at the base, I’d recommend making good use of them before making the climb. Once up at the top there are portable potties only. There are also two spots along the way where you can drink from a fountain and/or top up your water bottle. That was a blessing!  "
Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve,4.5,Great Views and Vistas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"$10 entry if you park in the lot, well worth the price for what you get in return. Rather than hike up the hill, we drove to the top and walked the very manageable trails. All were easily done but would recommend sneakers rather than sandals or Birkenstock’s. Saw some people with both and I imagine their dogs were barking after all that walking. We walked down to a flatter trail that led to another fantastic view of the beach. "
The Narrows,5.0,A MUST IF YOU ARE VISITING UTAH,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiking the Narrows was AMAZING!   We did it with 4 adults and 8 kids ages 14 to 4 yrs old  (2 of which were in backpack carriers).   We hiked over 10 miles round trip in about 6 hours (includes the riverside walk trail).   We wore our own water shoes and no hiking sticks, so you can save your money on the rentals unless the water is really  high or cold.   We went in late June, water was warm, temps hot, water level was low.  Its been over a month and our kids are still talking about it!"
The Narrows,5.0,DO IT but go early!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Awesome hike!!! Definitely spend the extra $25 to rent the wooden hiking stick and water shoes/neoprene socks from Zion Outfitters (located right outside the pedestrian entrance to the park). The stick actually provided a lot of stability when hiking through the water and the water shoes were NOT waterproof by any means, but helped support my ankles and give me better grip than my hiking shoes or tennis shoes would have. We went on October 1st, VERY EARLY in the day and we didn't encounter many people until our way back around 11. We hiked through Wall Street and then returned, Definitely recommend this hike!!"
The Narrows,5.0,Must do experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Just hiked this with my family during COVID pandemic. The narrows and angels landing hike are both must do’s! 
The Narrows,5.0,An absolute must in Zion,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Such a fun and different experience, even for frequent hikers/travelers.  This hike is a must on a trip to Zion.  As most have already stated, I'd definitely recommend spending the cash for waterproof gear and hiking stick to help stay warm and keep your balance on the rocks.  We went in early April so the water was still pretty chilly but we were able to remain relatively comfortable all the way to Wall Street, however we passed many in shorts and an old pair of tennis shoes that looked the worse for wear.  Also be prepared for crowds depending on the time of day/year and understand that, even if the Narrows was completely empty, speeding through this hike isn't really an option.  You're going to spend most of the time walking along hidden rocks, through currents that could sweep you off your feet if you don't take your time and the water levels can vary from ankle to waist/chest deep.  That being said, this hike was unlike anything I've ever done before I highly recommend it."
The Narrows,5.0,interesting but way too crowded,3.0 of 5 bubbles,we visited the national parks of Utah in Sept 2020. the narrows was one of the least enjoyable mainly due to the massive amount of people who were there at the same time. it felt more like a hike near a big city. 
The Narrows,5.0,Unique Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Amazing experience. Such a unique ""hike"". Started at sunrise on a cold February weekday morning. Even with 25F air temperature at 7am, I stayed plenty warm wearing 4 layers on top and 2 layers on the bottom  including wearing thermals. Gloves and hand warmers really helped and bring an extra pair of gloves as others have recommended. I had a small mishap on the return stepping into a trench with water up to my shoulders and my first pair of gloves got drenched. Dry bib package from Zion Outfitters worked great and the waterproof backpack that I added was quite helpful. Good boots and the hiking stick are needed. Feet are wet and cool with the Neoprene socks but not icy cold and very tolerable. I turned around at the end of Wall Street not too far past Floating Rock. Round trip took 6 hrs but I stopped a lot for photos. Best photography was on the return journey after 10am when the sun was overhead with light streaming down into the canyons. It was a Friday morning in February without shuttles running. Plenty of parking when I arrived just before sunrise. Beware that the rangers closed Zion Canyon Road later that morning to avoid overcrowding as many arrived at the Park for the weekend."
The Narrows,5.0,Fun hike through the water,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Zion is a bit of a zoo compared to other national parks which are quiet, peaceful, and tranquil - but the hike to the Narrows was still a fun and unique experience that I’d recommend."
The Narrows,5.0,Exciting adventure but you need to be prepared ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Let me start by saying I am a 57-year-old woman who does not exercise regularly and am a bit out of shape. In the Narrows, your traversing across and through a cold river from ankle to thigh depth 50% of the time! As such, you are stepping on lots of river rocks that you can see and not see. We feel very fortunate to get out of an 8 1/2 mile hike that was five hours long without twisting an angle on it. That being said, it’s a great adventure… Gorgeous Canyon views; I actually enjoy the cold water. What I want to strongly recommend is that you go to Zion guru or Zion outfitter’s and rent the neoprene socks and waterproof shoes with traction and a stick that really make a difference ($25 pp).  Because there is no shuttle taking you to the entrance of the Narrows and we had no desire to walk 6 1/2 miles each way to do it ourselves… We also pay $40 per person RT for transportation to and from the trailhead entrance.  How far you want to go it’s up to you… I would recommend at least a four hour hike...2 he’s in and 2 hours out.  If you’re in great shape you can double that!"
The Narrows,5.0,Epic hike at Zion National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiking The Narrows was our plan for our Zion National Park visit.  We thought we would aim for an early arrival on day one, but we weren’t early enough.  By the time we parked our car just outside the road closure for the scenic drive road, we learned we would have a six mile trek from that point just to get to the starting point of The Narrows.  As the car limit had been reached, we planned for a different approach on day two.  (Hint: You have to be at the park entrance extremely early, before that opens, for a shot at parking your car close to The Narrows trailhead)."
The Narrows,5.0,Memorable and worthwhile experience - but be well prepared!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family of 5 (me and my wife, and our 16, 18, and 20 year old sons) hiked the Narrows this week (second week in March).  Weather was in the 40s and the water temp was in the mid 30s so we were apprehensive about how comfortable we’d be.  But we were appropriately outfitted (at the Zion Adventure Company) in a double layer of neoprene socks under our water hiking boots, appropriate clothing under our dry suits, and as a result we’re comfortable for our hike.  The rocks are very uneven and slippery so it was critical for us that we had our walking sticks - those are fantastic.  Our sons went at a faster pace than my wife and I.  We only had about 3 1/2 hours for our actual hike in the water.  My sons made it a little past Wall Street in that time, and my wife and I got to within a quarter mile of it.  We were walking on the side of the river where possible so my wife and I covered about a third of the hike on dry land and the rest in the water.  The greener the water the deeper it is!  And you can clearly see when it’s running faster.  So be strategic about charting your path, make sure you’re well equipped and enjoy the unique views and experiences.  It really is beautiful and as the lighting changes you notice different things in the rocks and canyons."
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,Continue on dirt road to trailhead,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unless you want to hike 7 miles round trip take your 4 wheel drive vehicle and drive down the wide dirt/rock road to the actual trail head. We mistook the paved “overflow” parking lot as the trail head parking lot and our city family got in over our heads. Even if the paved parking lot and road is packed with cars you CAN still drive the dirt road to the trailhead. Signs recommend that you have 1 gallon of water per person & animal. We arrived by 9am and during our hike saw many overheated dogs. The dry heat in Arizona is no joke. Last bathroom option, port- a- potty style, is at the overflow parking lot. Trail map is there too. Climb to bridge is still .7 miles from trail head parking lot and is very steep staircase climb to reach the bridge. Beautiful views. "
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,A Must Do Hike in Sedona,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"( via Mescal Trail ) - go EARLY. We initially were going to hike this Thursday AM, and then the guys thought why don't we take the ATV's up here later .. you can take like half the trail with ATV and then hike the rest, but I wouldn't recommend that. If you do rent ATV's you'll want to be rippin' around on those the whole time, not having them parked while you hike. SO, we did a sunrise hike and started at 7 AM. It was beyond beautiful with a full moon still in the sky. We did this Saturday AM, but I have been told this is the busiest/touristy hiking trail of all Sedona. We met close to 100 ppl coming down as we were hiking up. When we reached the top/bridge area, there were probably 40 people in line to go out on the bridge for photo ops. By the time we left (20 min or so, wait for us) there were over 100 ppl in line. There are THREE trails you can take to get to the bridge and I cannot recommend Mescal Trail enough. Took us about 2.5 hrs total. Trail #1 is just a service road. The last part of the hike is very steep incline steps, otherwise the hike is a nice, moderate trail."
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,"Very touristy, if you have a jeep take it!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's pretty cool when you get up there but having to wait in line to get your picture takes away from the natural beauty and makes it so instagram touristy. We had to park in the road and walk to the parking lot. I recommend taking the Chuck Wagon trail from the parking lot. It's much more scenic and then you can skip walking most of the super fine red sand and rocky road. It was long and boring. If you have a vehicle than can go off roading, use it! Worth it to skip the boring road up to the trail. When you get to the actual hiking part is definitely a real hike. Lots of climbing and very steep. We must do a lot of really easy trails because this one was a lot more work. Worth it at the top. Please don't be stupid at the top!!! We saw a couple people step down so they were sitting on the ledge beneath with their feet dangling and a guy try to do a handstand. Also please be considerate of others waiting. One group had 5 people in it and did multiple individual pictures and couple pictures and group pictures and more individual pictures. There were probably 10 people waiting behind them and they took about 20 minutes. Most people took about 5 minutes to get out there, take a couple pics, and get back"
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,Great Trail on Foot or Off-Roading,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very popular, MUST DO hike when in Sedona that can be crowded at Devil's Bridge itself. It is @4 miles roundtrip on foot from the parking lot to Devil's Bridge. If you have a high clearance off-road vehicle you can shave a mile+ off that. The majority of the trail is flat with the exception of the very last part that can only be completed by foot and requires some climbing. Devil's Bridge is a great photo opportunity but there can be a line at certain times to walk out onto the bridge itself. The trail is mostly in the direct sun so make sure you take lots of water and dress appropriately. There is shade that can be found once reaching the Devil's Bridge area."
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,"GO EARLY, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived to Dry Creek Visa parking at 5am, the gate was still closed so we parked on the road which was only a few hundred feet away.  We were the first to reach the bridge at 6am with only one guy behind us, and another couple arriving about 10 minutes later. We were able to sit on the bridge for a while and enjoy it with no one waiting for us to move for pictures.  A line began to form around 7:00. "
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,Well Worth the Hike/Climb!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were given off the tourist grid parking advice and hiked the trail to Devil's Bridge. The Chuck Wagon Trail was reasonably well marked and there were enough (but not crowded) hikers to keep us from straying. The hike was easy with hiking sticks and the views spectacular! Approaching Devil's Bridge became more of a climb than a hike, but we made it to the top where other hikers were waiting their turn on the bridge - a natural rock formation about 90 yards from the ground. The wait was short and walking on the bridge was worth the hike (the hike itself was worth it!). The hike back was equally inspiring and, though we are not experienced hikers, we loved our new activity. Hiking shoes, water, hiking sticks and camera are recommended."
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,Stunning views for a short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Two couch potatoes plus daughter take on a challenge and find the payout ratio exceptionally good. The road to the trailhead is off-limits for anything below a real 4x4 vehicle and no, that does NOT include city SUVs, so prepare for an extra mile of hiking along dull gravel road both ways."
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,Get There Early!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Massive crowds make this a good but not great hike.  Depending on what time you arrive, there is typically a long line to walk across the bridge and pose for a photo.  Other than that, it's a nice hike.  Start very early in the morning to avoid large crowds. "
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,"Worth a visit, busy",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The first part of this hike is more of a walk along the road that 4 Wheel drive cars use to get to the trail head. Parking in the road at the weekend is busy, a lot of cars."
Devil's Bridge Trail,4.5,Jaw Dropping View,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hike itself is fairly moderate, but for the last bit.  It is then all uphill with a lot of rock scrambles.  If you are afraid of heights, then stop at the overlook just before the last rock scramble.  If you make it to the top, the area where the bridge is located is wide enough and actually has an amphitheater style seating to enjoy the vista.  Many people had lunch/snack at the top. "
Cliff Walk,4.5,"Wonderful views, great photo ops",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had limited time to do the Cliff Walk, but I'm glad we made it here. We had planned to walk from Easton Beach, but the metered parking was full so we drove to Narangansett Ave and there was plenty of inexpensive metered parking there (by license plate number). We arrived at 8:45am on a Friday and because the turnover there is high, there was still plenty of parking by the time we left at 10am. My sister ran the whole Cliff Walk as part of her morning run the day before our stroll, and I noticed plenty of metered parking by Easton Beach at the beginning of the cliff walk on a Thursday at 9am."
Cliff Walk,4.5,"Great walk, awesome views!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very enjoyable! I enjoy walking and hiking frequently and the Cliff Walk offers the best views to do so! We parked by the entrance to Easton’s Beach on street, metered. The path is well paved and marked in the area by the beach, however, certain areas are rocks only. Everything is well marked and I knew exactly where the terrain would be rough. Good for older children and adults, good footwear is necessary if you plan on accessing the entire walk."
Cliff Walk,4.5,Lovely walk and views; crowded,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did portions of the Cliff Walk after visiting The Breakers.  It’s certainly worth your time when visiting Newport.  The views of the water are stunning, and you also get to see several fabulous homes, some modern and some from ages gone by.  There are several entrances along the way; parts of the terrain are more challenging.  It’s easy to do only part of the walk.  The easier parts of the walk were very busy, making social distancing during COVID-19 somewhat difficult due to the narrow walk and volume of people.  That said, those visiting were conscientious about masks and everyone seemed to be trying their best. It was a nice stroll on a gorgeous summer day."
Cliff Walk,4.5,Newport Jazz Festival and Newport sights,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Jazz Festival is a favorite event and Newport is a fabulous destination.    The Cliff Walk is well worth the effort and you can walk half way or take the full walking trail.     The Mansion walk and tour(s) are worth the experience, although one or two tours will suffice.    Good restaurants all around.  "
Cliff Walk,4.5,Don't Miss The Cliff Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Cliff Walk is one of the more popular things to do in Newport and after a short time on it , you can understand why. There are many options to enter and exit the Cliff Walk and the views vary from ocean to mansion. There were a number of people on the Cliff Walk but masks and social distancing was prevalent."
Cliff Walk,4.5,Beautiful. Bring your own water! ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very frustrating. Many mile walk and the water fountains didn't work along the trail. Feel the City of Newport likes tourist dollars, but is cheap at providing services, such as water on a trail and available bathrooms."
Cliff Walk,4.5,One day walk about Newport,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is a Newport sponsored trolley (Bellevue #67) that runs from the Transportation Center downtown.  This is a free trolley and makes a round trip from downtown area of Thames St past a number of  mansions.  In our case the driver was very talkative describing the various landmarks, buildings and mansions.  One of the stops is in front of the ""The Breakers"" which allows tours of the grounds and such for a fee.  This stop is just past Salve Regina University on Ochre Point Ave going South on the way out of town.  Just to the right of The Breakers is Ruggles Ave which with a short walk East (about a block) leads to the cliff walk.  This a approximately 1/2 way down Cliff Walk, and according to the University students, going South is some of the best views of the walk.  We walked approximately 1/2 mile south when we came across a washed out area of the walk about 1/4 mile long.  Many people do cross this area, but it would not be recommended for anyone with balance or mobility issues.  We walked back where we exited the trolley and was able to catch one back to the Transportation Center.  The views were good and the walk of about a mile were prefect for us.  There is another access to the walk on the North end of Ochre Point Ave for those that desire a longer hike."
Cliff Walk,4.5,Great,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Cliffwalk is a FREE BEAUTIFUL PLACE to go for a walk or a run,or both! "
Cliff Walk,4.5,A MUST DO in Newport,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Go. It’s amazing. Start at either Easton Beach or go all the way to end at Bailey’s Beach. Take water, hat & sunscreen. And camera. I’ve never seen or done anything more fantastic than this! You can take a bus for $2 per ride or drive and park on side streets or parking near Easton Beach. 40 steps is at the end of Narranganset and has restrooms and it’s located about 1/4 mile from Easton. None of it is treacherous, mostly paved and there were many children & older people doing it. Please don’t litter. That was the saddest thing to see 🙁"
Cliff Walk,4.5,Unsafe during covid,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Plain ans simple, masks save lives.  There are signs posted throughout the trail asking people to wear a mask.  Around 35% of the people are following cdc guidelines.   Because it is so narrow you can't avoid people without a mask.  Really felt unsafe and frustrated.   It isn't much to ask, yet people are very inconsiderate.  I am traveling with my 93 year old mother.  We all must remember it isn't just about you, but how others are impacted.   "
Arches National Park,5.0,Stunning,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Simply amazing place. A Completely unique experience. Any review you read will say that the park will be busy but as with many places, if you avoid weekends and peak hours you can have more space to yourself. For me, I visited on Tuesday evening, Wednesday morning and evening  and it wasn't busy at all. I hiked to Delicate Arch before sunrise and I encountered maybe 20 people or so at the Arch. It also was much more manageable than in the heat of the day. Sunset delivers the true 'red rock' experience but I am told that brings a lot more people. So up to you! But make sure you visit all the Arches on the different trails. Each bring their own unique experience.  I purchased the annual National Park subscription which at $80 is a great deal if you plan to visit a few National parks throughout the year. My pictures are of Delicate Arch, Landscape Arch and the Windows."

Arches National Park,5.0,"A ""Must See"" Beautiful National Park For All Ages ",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Arches National Park  contains the world’s largest concentration of natural sandstone arches. There are over over 2,000 arches are located within the park’s 76,518 acres! The park also contains an astounding variety of other geological formations.   A paved scenic drive takes visitors to many of the major viewpoints within the park, although many required hiking ( hikes range from beginner to expert level). "

Arches National Park,5.0,AMAZING VIEWS with EASY ACCESS FOR ALL,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The line to enter the park took about 20 minutes all 3 times we went.  The road through the whole park is paved and there are many places to pull off for taking pics.  There are camp style bathrooms in numerous locations & considering the amount of people there, they were very clean.  The park is open 24 hrs & the view at sunset is spectacular. The visitor center is open till 5pm for the gift shop only & masks are required to enter.  They do monitor how many are inside & we had to wait about 5 mins before we could go in."
Arches National Park,5.0,The Government should NOT run something this beautiful,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The only problem with this National Park is that it's run by the government.  We left Cortez CO on March 20th before dawn and arrived at the entrance to Arches at 9AM. By then the two lanes were backed up nearly back to the highway, at least a half a mile maybe a mile.  "
Arches National Park,5.0,Ethereal,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Arches National Park is a treasure trove of excitement and adventure. You need at least 2-3 days in the park to cover all the hikes they offer. In October, the weather in the morning is cool and it gets hot by noon. We did our hikes in the morning and tried to avoid hikes in the afternoon heat, which worked out well. Plenty of parking and hikes for all ages and abilities. If you get to the park early in the morning (earliest we arrived was 6:30AM), you don't have to pay the park entrance fee. Definitely recommend Delicate Arch and The Windows hikes. There are many points to look out from, including the Petrified Dunes. The vistas are gorgeous and pictures do not capture their beauty. There are other activities to do besides hiking, including riding 4-wheelers, climbing up the sand dunes, and rafting on the river."
Arches National Park,5.0,Amazing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This park gets crowded. Even though we were here on an off season it was still busy. There was a sign saying that they were full and to come back in three to five hours. So we explored another spot and returned to find the sign gone. So we waited in one of the two lines. Paid with cash to simplify the process and received a map with information on the park as well. 
Arches National Park,5.0,Beautiful Arches,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited The Arches during the cool of the evening in July 2020. Although the rangers were limited in contact with visitors due to CoVid, one ranger did recommend to us a specific time to visit, between 6:15- 7:30. We took his advice and were definitely blessed by what we experienced. The Arches’ beauty and wonder was enhanced by the evening changes of light. It was cool enough to walk to many specific arches and marvel in the architecture of nature. Our family visited the Windows and the Double Arch that evening. They were amazing!!! We stood beneath the opening of the Double Arch and viewed the clear blue sky and fluffy clouds. Wow!"
Arches National Park,5.0,Breathtaking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Words cannot express the magic and beauty of this iconic place.  There are many trails, all of them worth taking. Definitely do the Devils Garden - Dark Angel hike, with perhaps the caution that while the Primitive trail is outstanding, there are a few sketch spots that require balance and a steady foot.  Wildlife. The trails are well maintained but I'd still recommend downloading GPS maps (such as the Gaia or AllTrails GPS apps) because the trails can be easy to miss, especially as the sun is coming down."
