Tunnel View,5.0,A Must Place To Stop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Even for just 15 minutes, stop here. Enjoy the view and take a lot of pictures. It is so beautiful to just view the cascading mountain slopes. And it was so busy, parking lot is almost always full. We took pictures and left."
Tunnel View,5.0,STUPENDOUS!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I don't think I'll ever be able to forget how spectacular this natural wonder is.  Not to be missed.  It is almost as though one can't tear one's eyes away.  I've never seen any photo, even Ansel Adams' (which is magnificent) that have done his justice."
Tunnel View,5.0,The Best View in the National Park System,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is a reason National Geographic chose this site for its cover picture on National Parks, it is the most amazing view in the NPS.  The way El Capitan, Half Dome and Bridal Veil Falls are perfectly framed here makes this an amazing, MUST SEE sight.  I have been fortunate enough to see it twice and both times it confirms the existence of the Almighty.  It is perfect for pictures with people and all by itself.  It is a place you simply MUST VISIT if you come to the park.  It is truly amazing and incredible, beyond an ability for words to capture.  However, to show you what the NPS thinks about the view, Tunnel View is the scene for the best NPS sign I have seen."
Tunnel View,5.0,Most iconic view of Yosemite Valley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the MOST iconic view point of Yosemite Valley and you shouldn’t miss this spot while visiting the Park. Visit the area either early morning or during sunset hours and the view is going to reward you. Don’t be in rush, take some photos and appreciate the view!"
Tunnel View,5.0,Mother Nature at her best.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Read on here that sunrise is the best time to visit. I guess must be contingent on weather conditions. Got there an hour before sunrise until and 1 1/2 hours after and was honestly underwhelmed. I guess time of year and sun position must have an influence also.
Tunnel View,5.0,Late Afternoon Photo Spot,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you want a great view of the Yosemite Valley but don't have the time or desire to drive all the way to Glacier Point, then at least take the time to drive here.  It can be crowded but the parking lot is pretty large and most people don't spend a lot of time here, so parking spots are usually available.  We went just before sunset and the golden late afternoon light shining on El Capitan was spectacular."
Tunnel View,5.0,Best entrance to experience Yosemite's beauty. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Absolutely the best way to enter the park.  If you have to come to Yosemite from 120 or 140 then go to the tunnel before seeing the park. And you may want to visit it again before you leave.   It will be a different experience each time. 
Tunnel View,5.0,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We wanted to see the view coming out of the tunnel - so drove through and turned around.  Just magnificent.  There are parking lots on both sides of the road so please do stop and get out and admire the beauty.  It's well worth it.
Tunnel View,5.0,A Magnificent View of Yosemite Valley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As we drove toward Yosemite Valley we came out of the Tunnel and planned to stop at the parking lot to see the view.  It gets very busy and it can take a few minutes to find parking.  It only took us 3 or 4 minutes because we happened to find someone pulling out.  However, it usually takes longer and requires some patience. The view of Yosemite Valley is spectacular and it provides a panorama of Half Dome and El Capitan and the valley.  We were able to get some terrific pictures. This is a must stop location on the way into the Valley."
Tunnel View,5.0,Excellent view of the valley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was the 1st point of our full day trip to Yosemite National Park. The place offers excellent view of the valley and North Dome at the back. There were lots of tourists at this place for a great view of the valley and is a great photo stop. Also there was space to accomodate many vehicles.

Bridalveil Fall,4.5,parking lot is closed due to maintenance,3.0 of 5 bubbles,when we visited the park in mid june of 2021 the parking area for Bridal Veil Fall was closed due to maintenance. there wasn't any parking to be found. the parking area for swinging bridge was packed and people were double parking in the area. we didn't get to hike to this fall
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,An Iconic Waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"These waters cascade more than 600 feet down a sheer rock surface. They are very high up, and the wind currents there blow the falling waters into a fine mist. The Native Americans called this the “Spirit of the Puffing Wind”."
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,Bridalveil Falls was roaring and loud!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a stunning waterfall that is a must see and do on your bucket list.  We recently traveled to Yosemite national park and wanted to see all the waterfalls throughout the park.  California had a very rainy and snowy winter, above average, so going there in early June was the perfect time to see Bridalveil Falls.  The snow was melting at such a high clip, that the water flow was massive and roaring with no stopping insight.  We got excelling videos and pictures.  The waterfalls look like a bridal veil, thus the name."
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,"Beautiful, but beware the smoke",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As of our visit on September 13th, the water is flowing and you can still hike up to the base of the falls.  There's some restoration work going on in the area, but it didn't hamper us at all.  The main deterrent right now is the smoke, which is off and on going from a little foggy to nightfall at noon.  "
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,Misty Bridal Veil is best in June,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bridal Veil is best in June.  Bring a plastic bag to wear.  The mist will soak you.  And wear sturdy non-slip shoes as the rocks are wet.  Sadly, some people don't feel they have to pick up their trash.  Be a good do bee and bring a trash bag to pick up litter.  Not enough rangers to do that efficiently on the trails.  I have my kids do the same when we hike anywhere.  We do it on our way back unless we see a pile of trash.  Then we stop and pick it up.  People on tour buses are the worst.  I think they view our National parks like Disneyland where there are people to pick up after you.  I guess they are right because my family picks up their trash.  Maybe the tour opporators should say something to the tourists with them."
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,Centrepiece of some classic Yosemite views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail to the falls remains closed, but you can view them from Valley View, Tunnel View and from pull-overs on the road in the western end of the Valley."
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,Beautiful Waterfall !,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A beautiful waterfall! Catch it in the right light and it can look like a firefall. It is a short and easy hike to the viewing area. The fall is very beautiful and you will probably get hit with the spray and mist of it. This is especially nice on a hot day. Beware: don’t go beyond the railings. Many have been injured and a couple even killed climbing over the rocks( wet polished granite with moss). It is perfectly safe and enjoyable from the viewing area. Unfortunately this year (2020) the parking lot and trail are closed. The fall can be seen from the road or at other points in the valley.
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,Water was still coming in strong.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mid September and the fall was still pretty heavy. Parking lot was still in repairs but had no trouble in finding a spot on the street near the trailhead. Beautiful sight worth the visit.
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,Flowing ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Still flowing in September, that one is particularly nice in the evening during sunset. Very nice waterfall "
Bridalveil Fall,4.5,Bust,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Between the water no longer flowing off the falls, the incredible amount of smoke from the Creek Fire, along with the the parking area being closed due to construction, BridalVeil Falls was a complete flop for us.  Something we were really excited to see, and we didn't get to experience really any of what we were hoping to."

Sentinel Dome,5.0,THE view at Yosemite!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the place to come for views if you only have limited time or are unable to undertake some of the more strenuous hikes. The short and fairly easy hike to the dome is followed by a marginally steep but also short hike up the dome itself, upon the summit of which truly glorious views of the region can be found in all directions - Half Dome, El Capitan and all the rest. This is a superior view to that from Glacier Point other than being somewhat further away from Nevada Falls."
Sentinel Dome,5.0,New parking lots!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of my favorite places to hike in Yosemite, and I was happy to ascend the dome twice during my October visit."
Sentinel Dome,5.0,Spectacular Sentinel Dome,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our second favorite hike at Yosemite (Nevada Falls Loops was #1).  The main portion of the hike is short and fairly easy.  It's the last portion when you have to climb the dome to the top that is really tough.  It is extremely steep and challenging to climb, but the payoff is immense.  This hike isn't as crowded as some of the rest, and some people stop halfway up the dome and don't make it.  We left early for this hike and were able to enjoy the top of the dome for 15 minutes before anyone else made it up..and the views were just spectacular.  My key tip:  don't give up half way up the dome like many...take your time and pace yourself...you won't regret it."
Sentinel Dome,5.0,Greats views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views from Sentinel dome are breathtaking.  You can see Half Dome and the eastern half of Yosemite Valley on one side, and El Capitan, the Three Brothers, and the western half of Yosemite Valley on the other side."
Sentinel Dome,5.0,Amazing views with relatively short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't miss this hike!  It's pretty short but the pay off is amazing.  It took us about 30 minutes or so to get to the top where there is a panoramic view.  The view is probably better than at Glacier Point and it wasn't crowded.  Definitely worth the time.  Would be amazing to see the sun set here.
Sentinel Dome,5.0,Great Hike and Awesome Views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were in Yosemite for 2 full days between our time in San Francisco and Las Vegas. Honestly, I thought this would be the low point of the trip but we enjoyed it just as much or more than the the other legs."
Sentinel Dome,5.0,Breathtaking Vista point,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"In Lonley Plant they say that this hike seems like a cheat. You get to such wonderfull Vista point with relatively short trail which is fairly easy. The view is astonishing, you can see the entire valley with it magnificent rock formation. You can also see the Nevada falls. The trail it self is relatively flat and just in the very end You climb to the Dome. We saw several small children doing the trail"
Sentinel Dome,5.0,Get a 360 degree view of the entire valley without a difficult hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hike up to Sentinel Dome is relatively easy, especially in comparison to many of the other hikes in Yosemite.  It is mostly flat until you get around the dome, and then you climb up.  It's just over a mile each way, but not overly strenuous.  Even the climb at the end isn't that bad.  Once you are up there..."
Sentinel Dome,5.0,Great place to get a 360 view of the Yosemite Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a great place to get a 360 degree view of the Park. The trail to get access to the dome is pretty easy. The parking lot does get full pretty quickly so ensure to visit outside of busy hours.
Sentinel Dome,5.0,"Road closed, view dome from afar",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since Glacier Point Road is closed this year, it’s not really feasible to enjoy the short hike up to the top of Sentinel Dome.  So this year we just viewed Sentinel Dome from North Dome across the Valley.  It is a very different perspective to look at Sentinel Dome rather than being on Sentinel Dome."

Mist Trail,5.0,Should be top Yosemite hike on everyone's list,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Worth every minute of the climb! The first mile or so is bland upward climbing but soon enough the falls come into view and everything becomes so immersive that you forget about the continual stairs (and there are indeed large parts of actual stairs here). Even during this summer of extremely low water levels and an essentially completely dry Yosemite Falls by late July, both Vernal and Nevada Falls were incredibly beautiful."
Mist Trail,5.0,There is water on the way up,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I just wanted to inform you all that there are a few free fountains water on the way up. About after 30/45min going up.
Mist Trail,5.0,Highlight of our California ( SF-Monterey-Yosemite) fortnight - WOW!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Probably the best hike we’ve ever done as a family, we walked to Vernal Falls first and then on up Nevada Falls and back. C.7 miles, c3,500 total climb, c.4 hours walking but c.7 hours total with all the WOW view stops and a proper break at the top of Nevada Falls before following the John Muir trail back down (a little longer but less busy and not just retreading the steps you take up)"
Mist Trail,5.0,"Drenched, and loved it!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After a heavy winter snow, the run off of water was exceptional.  The trail can take some time and finish and it is always up hill with a lot of steps!  The views are worth it though! Absolutely bring a waterproof jacket, pack etc.  My trip past Vernal falls was so full of spray the falls were almost unseeble, some choosing to actally turn back ( though I doubt it's normally this bad)  since the trail was with in the heavy spray. It is really worth the trip, and plan to spend some time at the top of Nevada falls where you can sit down for a picnic!  The views are great as you look down the valley past the ""silver apron"" and ""Emerald pools"".  "
Mist Trail,5.0,Steep But Worth It,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had already done quite a bit of walking/hiking before we started up this trail (from the parking lot to Lower Yosemite Falls, then to Mirror Lake, then to the trailhead for this hike)  since the shuttle buses are not operating this Summer.  For that reason, I only walked up the the Vernal Falls footbridge - my wife did continue a bit further to the bottom of the stairs going up to the top of Vernal Falls.  Even up to the footbridge, the trail, while wide and paved, is still quite steep and also pretty crowded.  If we had been able to ride the shuttles to some of the trailheads I would have liked to go further up on this trail, but by the end of the day I had put over 14 miles in, so I was glad I decided to stop here.  It was still quite a beautiful hike, and one everyone who is capable of should try and do."
Mist Trail,5.0,Not for kids,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an amazing trail that leads to Vernal and Nevada Falls. It is not for kids though! We saw so many young kids or people hiking with flip flops on, I hope they weren't going past the steps to Vernal Falls. It is not too bad of a hike to the bottom of Vernal and you can get a great view! But once the stairs get wet, and the trail gets crowded, it can be very tricky. More people die on this trail than any other part of Yosemite. We turned around once the handrail for the stairs ended, it was too crowded and slippery to go any further without something to hold on to. Still got some amazing pictures!"
Mist Trail,5.0,Wonderful Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Considered  a moderately strenuous hike covering slightly over 1000 feet in elevation change. The Mist trail is 0.8 miles to the footbridge (so 1-1/2 miles round trip) OR, 1.2 miles approx to the top of Vernal Falls(2.4 miles round trip) . Good ops of Vernal Falls from the footbridge. Also of note is that there is water available just past the footbridge to fill up water bottle. The second half of the hike from footbridge to the falls is considerably more uphill, but my wife and I in our mid 60's got to the base of Vernal Falls. Allow for 2 to 3 hours depending on length of hike and ability.  Recommendation is to hike in the morning during the summer months!"
Mist Trail,5.0,Our Favorite Hike at Yosemite... so far!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was hands down our favorite and most challenging hike at Yosemite considering we were on a family trip. It starts off pretty easy, with a steady uphill, and when you reach the spectacular verbal falls, it’s approximately 600 steps to the top. "
Mist Trail,5.0,Challenging steep uphill hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For these 60+ y.o. legs, was a bit challenging. The walk to Vernal Falls bridge is easy, to the top of Vernal Falls moderate but WORTH IT, and extended to the bridge that gives you a great view of Nevada Falls. We turned around here because it would be another 1000 ft and 2 hrs to go all the way to the top of Nevada falls. "
Mist Trail,5.0,Trail with lots of civilization,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We headed up the Mist Trail with dozens of other hikers and walkers.  The first part to the footbridge is paved and busy busy busy.  The view of Illilouette Fall is an extra bonus.

Tioga Pass,5.0,Take an Extra 20 mile down out of the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a GREAT drive, with beautiful view of mountains, valleys, and Half Dome.  If taking the road from the west, it starts off slow but gets better as you head towards the Tioga Pass. Once you reach the pass, you need to continue out of the park for about another 20 miles to the town of Lee Vining, through  Inyo National Forest.  This drive was about 20 miles, dropping from an elevation of 9,945 feet to 6,837 feet.  It was INCREDIBLE!!!!  The town was nothing.  We thought we would stop for some Ice cream, but could not find anything from a convivence store.  But you will LOVE the drive, almost straight down, with the view of mountains, lakes  and the valley.  Don't miss it!"
Tioga Pass,5.0,Scenic but very scary. Would not do it again,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Oh this pass is scary. Great view but there is a point (direction yosemite to Lee Vining)  where you are just about hanging on the cliff, driving to the edge no barriers no protection no anything. We were driving also with an RV which made it worse. You are at a point looking ahead and you observe the road going abruptly down on the other side of the mountain thinking omg are you going to be there too and oh yes you are."
Tioga Pass,5.0,Grand Sights,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The east entrance to the park is the lesser-used entrance and a beautiful drive through mountains, meadows, and valleys.  We were fortunate enough to get a day pass, but the line was still very long because it was filled with people that did not realize they needed a pass.  Once in the park, we sat for a long time in a construction pilot car line.  The parking lots in the valley were all full or closed.  The park has become a very difficult place to maneuver/enjoy.  The sights are spectacular, but the time spent getting from one place to another detracts greatly from the experience."
Tioga Pass,5.0,Construction,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had to wait for a pilot car to travel on Tioga Pass Road through the construction, but there is no more beautiful place to sit in a car.  Everywhere you look are amazing views. "
Tioga Pass,5.0,Road trip the Pass,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a beautiful drive from the valley through the alpine of Yosemite. It’s a spectacular drive into Lee Vining. We drove it all the way to 6E and then through Nevada but the pass itself is wonderful. I would love to do it when I have time to stop and do some of the hikes or swim in the lake.
Tioga Pass,5.0,Don’t miss this drive if the rod is open!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful drive that shouldn’t be missed when the road is open. I love that it wasnt’t crowded in mid august. Granite formation you see along the drive, the lakes, the snow capped peaks was incredibly scenic! I prefer Tioga pass than  the valley floor honestly. From Lee Vining to the valley floor we made 4 stops & ended up to be an 8 hour ordeal. Take your time & just take it all in. You won’t regret it. Tip: if you’re short on time skip Tuolumne grove. The hike back is strenuous 1 mile."
Tioga Pass,5.0,Bold scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Man this drive was stunning. This drive is actually better than the actual park itself. The rock formations,(Olmstead pt) the 2 lakes you see (tenaya and tioga lake , the  Tuolumne meadows, and I hiked up lembert dome, these are the 4th spectacular stops you must see, the tioga lake is last. This is on the eastern part of park. I was coming from San Francisco so got there around 1pmand got out of there by dusk. If you have 2 days in yosemite, make this part of it. The valley is beautiful but of course only the lower waterfalls was flowing so that might be my opinion. I think tioga is more breathtaking. I had 2 days in yosemite and once again spent one of them here. This was early October 2022"
Tioga Pass,5.0,"This was a beautiful road, but please exercise caution!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you enjoy hairpin turns, scenery that you would expect in the movies, and tons of adventures, drive this road. It was arduous to drive once the sun went down. Olmsted Point and Tuolumne Meadows were on this road. The speed limits did change quite a bit."
Tioga Pass,5.0,Wonderful Drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were a little hesitant to make the drive. A lot of reviews and youtube videos talked about it being scary and frightening. It really wasn't bad at all. The Hetch Hetchy drive to the reservoir was worse.
Tioga Pass,5.0,The best part of yosemite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There is so much to see! Different terrains, beautiful photo opportunities. Our favorites were Yosemite creek picnic area, Olmsted point, tenaya lake swimming and enoing, and pothole dome. A perfect day for our family of six!"

Vernal Fall,4.5,Premier Hike Expereience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are adventurous , this hike is well worth it. The trail to Vernal falls is 1-1/2 miles round trip to footbridge( or about 2-1/2 miles roundtrip to top of falls)   and considered to be ""moderately strenuous"". My wife and I were 64 and 63 years old when we did the hike in mid July of 2021. Note of caution however, is it can be really hot in July on that trail....so.  instead of going in the afternoon, we opted for the next morning when it was considerably cooler , which was smart. Trail covers a little over 1000 feet in elevation and is mostly uphill with a few downhill stretches. A little over halfway to the falls proper, you come to the footbridge (0.8 miles in) , from whence you can see the falls in the distance, offering good photo ops. The reminder of the trail from the bridge to the falls is more uphill, and one should consider going on or not, depending on health, water, etc.. There is water available just past the bridge to refill bottles. My wife and I did do the second stretch to just beneath the falls, However, we did NOT do the additional distance from beneath the falls to the top of the falls- But a friend of ours had done it and thought it worth while, but being in our 60's and somewhat tired, we decided to turn around and head back. Overall the hike was roughly 3 hours for my wife and I due to the additional walking from the first parking area (not the second smaller trail head lot) to the Mist Trail trail head. My wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly and certainly recommend the hike! PS Falls are 317 feet in height with impressive different colored granite as backdrop!"
Vernal Fall,4.5,Starts moderate then gets strenuous ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail starts moderate but gets tougher with steep unsteady path and steps. You need sensible walking footwear and a level of fitness to get to the top of the waterfall and come back down the same way. We set off 8am and there were flies around but cool, returning 1-2pm it was much hotter, busier and no flies."
Vernal Fall,4.5,Yosemite is still worth visiting !,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Vernal Falls is just as beautiful from last time we visited . However, at this time, the water level was low and not misty as the trail was named towards the falls. "
Vernal Fall,4.5,Spectacular !!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What an amazing view and wonderful trip. Can't believe we were able to hike this challenging uphill trail to a beautiful waterfall. Water was freezing but did not stop others from jumping in. Can't wait to go back when the falls are fuller. 
Vernal Fall,4.5,Worth the CLIMB!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My girlfriend and I were just in Yosemite on a day trip and wanted the shortest hike to a waterfall to save on time. While it was definitely A HIKE (all up hill), it took just a few hours to go up to the falls and back down. Plenty of spots to rest, catch your breath, and take in the beautiful scenery! Pack your water bottle, don't worry there is a restroom half way up. The falls are gorgeous and if you're lucky, you'll catch a rainbow through the mists! Wear good hiking shoes, the stairs by the falls are steep, wet, and slippery! "
Vernal Fall,4.5,"Strenuous hike, worth the trip for the falls and vista",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Falls were beautiful but not at full strength as it was October.  For me, it was as much or more about the vistas and the exercise.  "
Vernal Fall,4.5,Simply stunning and breathtaking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Best hike of my life!! No words to describe how beautiful the trail and the falls are. 1) It’s nearly 4 miles roundrip if you stay on the mist trail (not 2.5 or 3 miles as some claim). 2) It’s 6.1 miles if you go up the mist trail and down the John Muir trail. 3) There is a TON of water in the summer, not sure what these other reviewer‘s were seeing or not seeing. 4) The stairs make it very strenuous. Be realistic about your abilities rather than and give les stars because of your physical condition. 5) If you’re not physically fit, go to the foot bridge and back. The views at the foot bridge are still worth it!!"
Vernal Fall,4.5,Loved seeing the falls in September,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well we loved seeing the falls from the bridge, but really disappointed the Mist Trail was closed during the day.  After the brutal climb up theJohn Muir trail, it was disappointing to not get that close to the falls.  Maybe next time !"
Vernal Fall,4.5,Go early in the day!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started just after 7am and had few others with us on the trail. It was a steep incline, but most people can do this very popular hike. I wouldn’t have wanted to be starting this hike later in the day like the people we saw on our way back down from Nevada Fall. "
Vernal Fall,4.5,Mist trail is the way to fully experience,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unfortunately the Mist Trail was closed until 3.30 on the day I was there. You really need the Mist Trail to get the full effect of these falls. You can see the falls from a distance on the JMT or else from a top down angle at the top of the falls by heading down from Clark Point, but I couldn't really get the full appreciation."

Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Finally seeing the famous Sequoias!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a wonderful day in Mariposa Grove. Being our first time in Yosemite we knew the Sequoias in Mariposa Grove would be the first site we wanted to see. The area was busy and parking was very packed. There is a shuttle service to the trailhead which is very necessary (without the shuttle you would have to take a very steep 2 mile hike just to get to the trailhead). There are various hikes you can take and obviously the shorter routes are much busier. Have an idea prior to your trip on what you want to see to better determine the route you want to take. Our family went further than a majority of the crowds and made our way to the Telescope Tree (very cool to actually go inside a Sequoia!). Our ""custom"" hike was just under 6 miles. Take breaks and plenty of water especially on a warm day!"
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,"Great views of the sequias, but take the long hike!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved our visit to the mariposa grove.  Outside of Muir Woods in CA, this was our first visit to a large grove and it was really breathtaking.  Most folks on tours or visiting only go on the shorter trail. Take the long trail and see the trees around the upper grove.  We would have hiked more, but missed a few shortcuts we could have taken on perimeter trails They could use some better maps to show how the short cuts will save you time, especially for folks that dont want longer hikes.  Fantastic views for us with fantastic weather!"
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,one of the best experiences of my life.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"i am so very glad we got to experience this. my wife and I took our oldest here for her graduation present and it was such a great experience.  we came july 2020 during the coronavirus upheaval and couldn't get a day entry pass so we took the YARTS bus into the park and it dropped us of right at the grove parking lot, which is literally right next to the park entrance. we got there as early as the YARTS bus could get us there, so we arrived at the mariposa grove parking area/bus stop at 830am. since they aren't running the park shuttles we walked the trail from the parking area to the grove.  there was barely anyone else around, only maybe 10-20 cars in the parking lot.  we are very active people so the hike to the grove on the trail wasn't difficult and took us about 45 minutes to cover the 2 miles. once we got to the grove (I want you to listen carefully to me here), it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.  there was basically no one there.  i counted 11 other people  the entire time we were walking around the grove. it felt like we had it to ourselves and i felt so honored to have gotten that experience.  i have never had that feeling in nature before.  the trees are absolute giants and it was so cool to see them.  we sat for 15 minutes on the benches at/under the grizzly giant and just absorbed how large and awesome it is and didn't see another person the whole time we sat there.     we walked the rest of the Grizzly Giant Loop Trail and it was just as excellent as anyone could ever ask for.  we didn't rush ourselves and we spent a comfortable amount of time in the grove and enjoyed ourselves there.  we made it back to the grove parking area to catch the YARTS bus back out of the parking area about 1230 or so.  since we didn't know how long it would take us to get to the grove, we were hiking with a good bit of hustle, but were able to take our time in the grove and on the hike back to the parking area.  awesome experience, highly recommend.  if you decided to take the trail from the parking area to the grove, your shoes and lower legs are going to be absolutely covered in dust.  my wife and daughter used the time before the bus came one we got back to the parking area to wash their legs.  being the caveman that i am i chose to just stew in my grime."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,A L E R T  the   P U B L I C  >>> N P S,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rangers were wrong. TIP: Read these 2021 posts people. No family should need to walk 6 miles to see these trees. I saw toddlers, little dogs and the elderly all on their near death hike to the trees during the heatwave. Many never made it. What a National Park Service (NPS) mistake this is! The Rangers are set up on wrong side of the visitor center. The public unknowingly walks to the trailhead without NPS input. You'd think someone is charge would step up. The Shuttles are not running. The New Visitor Center is now 2 miles away from the old Center so everyone with outdated guide books is ill prepared. Plan to see sequoias elsewhere."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Mariposa Grove - Yosemite,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since they have renovated and upgraded the area it's quite a place to visit! I visited in June and the grove is located  1hr south of Yosemite valley on hwy 41. After parking in a fairly large lot, you can either go to the store or jump on one of the buses that will drive  ( at no cost, since it's still in Yosemite) you to Mariposa Grove.  Once there you can wander at your own speed and take the various wide circuitous paths around the area. The trees are magnificent and are truly big! Some of their branches as bid as a normal tree!  If you want to see big Sequoias without the crowds this is the park in my opinion.  Buses were full but available."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Post Washburn Fire visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We shuttled up early in the morning to avoid the heat of the day.  The Mariposa Grove shuttle driver clearly explained where to get off the shuttle and where to get back on.  I noticed that the line to get back on the shuttle to head down has been updated with ropes to keep folks organized; when we visited in June, getting on the shuttle was just a pushy free-for-all. The return ride was about a 30 minute wait to board a shuttle.  Midweek, late Sept."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Not worth the hike,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you have ever seen a giant sequoia anywhere else-Muir Woods, N Coast, Kings Canyon, you can skip Mariposa Grove. I love to hike and I love trees, but this was so disappointing. 2 mile hike uphill through manzanita that was very exposed and hot then you get to the ""grove"" and there are very few trees! I was expecting a beautiful, lush, cooling hike and grove. Nope. Unfortunately fire damage and managed thinning has reduced this grove to a few trees. I would not recommend. There is no shuttle right now. Maybe if the shuttle is running it would be worth a quick look. "
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Giant Trees,4.0 of 5 bubbles,If you haven’t seen sequoias before it is about 30 miles from the west entry of El Portal side. There is a shuttle that runs during the summer. During the winter it is about an extra 4 mile round trip to get to the shuttle drop off up a hill or through the trail in the woods. There are some really large sequoias there like Grizzly Bear and the walk through tree.
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,Beautiful area of Yosemite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an amazing way to spend a couple hours. This is right near the south entrance of the park. This section of the park had only been opened a couple days when we visited so the shuttles were not running. We left the parking lot about 9 and walked up the road. It took 50 minutes. Once we got up there it was REALLY snowy. The snow was pretty packed but we did slip and slide a little bit. For sake of time, we only hiked out to the tunnel tree (0.7) and then came back the same way. There are much longer hikes you can do if you want. It was a beautiful area of the park. Make sure you pack snacks and water and go to the bathroom before you go up. I would suggest doing this as early as possible to avoid large crowds. Great way to spend 3+ hours."
Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,4.5,"This walk will get your heart pumping, but well worth it.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is Yosemite, not Disneyland. So it’s nature at its best. This is hundreds of years of history in the making, it was never designed for humans to have an easy time seeing it. Having said that it has certainly been assisted in modern times to let us visit it. To give a balanced review we took the trail up from the main car park. $35 to enter Yosemite, but that lasts for 7 days. The walk up does have some fallen trees on it, of which most you walk around. If not, sit on it and slide over. It’s a steep walk and takes over an hour. Yes, it’s 2 miles. At that point you reach the car park, or if you had the appropriate badge, that’s where you park. Toilets were open and operational. Fallen Monarch road with easy access at this point is closed as there was damage to it. However easy access road to the left all the way to Bachelor and Three sisters is open, though to be honest if you are pushing a wheelchair it isn’t going to be easy. From here we walked the trail to Grizzly Giant and California Tunnel Tree. Total time at this point for a man of 60 years from entrance to Tunnel Tree took exactly one and a half hours. That was what I wanted to see so I can’t comment on anything else beyond. Return walk was down the road and was smoother but felt longer. No speeding traffic came past, just plenty of happy hikers with pleasant “Good mornings.” Total time to Tunnel Tree and back was 3 hours. Total distance 6.2 miles. Plenty of toilets available at various intervals, road or trail. If you are inspired by natures wonders well worth the effort. If you are looking for Disneyland and staff at every corner you are visiting the wrong location. Put simply, sorry to say but not everyone will be able to visit and enjoy it. For those that can, do. Another attraction nearby is the swinging bridge which is a lot easier to drive and walk to, which we did later, so consider that if you don’t want this strenuous hike."

El Capitan,5.0,Stupendous ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Not that anything in Yosemite can be rated but this is one of my favorite landmarks in the park. You see it on your entrance and exit driving down the 140 so I fell for it. It has a smooth face like its carved out of clay and a pretty pale pink and golden cream color in the sunset. It looks different and impressive from every angle. Photos of it and Bridalviel together are unreal 
El Capitan,5.0,"REMINDS ME OF ""CLOSE ENCOUNTERS""!!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Whether you're up close or viewing it from another vantage point, it's still awe inspiring.  We viewed it driving in first and stopping along Southside Drive (one way).  Pre-covid, you would be jammed up with traffic both on this road and parking to stop and admire.  If there's any plus to this dreaded virus that's befallen all of us, it's that now in the park you can take your time and more easily find places to view and stop.  "
El Capitan,5.0,Isabelle (France),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"In Yosemite national park, we were impressed by El Capitan, with its massive bulk and vertical face soaring 3000 feet high. El Capitan is made of hard granite, allowing it to resist the pressures of glaciers and erosion, giving it its typicalpattern!"
El Capitan,5.0,Surreal Gigantic Wall of Granite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"On our way out of the valley to our lodge, our last stop was at El Capitan.  We parked in the small lot next to the road and walked the short hike to the two trails that climbers use, leading up to the base of this gigantic wall of granite.  My wife walked up one of them and got right up to the face of the cliff, putting her hands on the wall, and also talked to a young man who was preparing to do some climbing on this Mecca for rock climbers.  I was pretty beat and my knees were complaining after over 14 miles of walking and hiking so I contented myself with craning my neck to look up the 3000+ feet to the top and scanning the wall with my binoculars.  I was lucky enough to catch a brief glimpse of a climber rappelling down the cliff face.  Photos and words cannot really convey the scale of this giant rock - seeing it in person is almost a surreal experience."
El Capitan,5.0,One of the most well-known areas of the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the most iconic views of any of the national parks and one of Yosemite's most unique features. Viewing this from anywhere in the park provides a different experience especially when the sunlight hits it at different parts of the day. A good way to view it, along with the entire valley, is from Tunnel View which can add much more dramatic features and textures as the shadows start to set in!"
El Capitan,5.0,Looming Like a Rock Wave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When a rock has a name you know it is impressive.  I have only seen El Cap from the valley floor but the words to describe it fall short.  We saw it from several places but the best may be from the meadow along the valley road.  Here our group marveled at climbers you could actually see ascending as well as the hanging tents they use for sleep.  At 3,000 vertical feet of rock, there is really nothing else that compares to it.  In additional you will feel it as its shape is like a building wave that looms over you.  It is a highlight and you should stop and see it from as many places as you can."
El Capitan,5.0,Majestic and Intriguing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,El Capitan is the most revered of all sites in this National Park. This towering sheer granite monolith rises to a height of 3593 feet above the meadow. The sleek striated surface glows red at sunset and the shadows cast on it by the passing clouds during the daytime are very intriguing. 
El Capitan,5.0,Dawn Wall a must,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's hard to get the true scale, even when you are standing near the base but it's impressive none the less.  It's so large, you almost lose context of how it compares against other large structures.  For example, it's twice as high as the Empire State building."
El Capitan,5.0,Slippery as hell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Been watching climbing documentaries for years, fascinated by the sheer brutal appearance of El Cap. "
El Capitan,5.0,Iconic wall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Made famous world wide by Alex Honnold in Free Solo, El Capitan takes your breath away. This time around I hiked to the top of it through eagle's peak. The wall has magnetic pull and reminds us of all the classic big wall routes that started here."

Half Dome,5.0,Memorable hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Half dome is a gorgeous vista from the valley, and it’s an even better sight from the top."
Half Dome,5.0,MAGNIFICENT!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I don't think I'll ever be able to forget how spectacular this natural wonder is.  Not to be missed.  It is almost as though one can't tear one's eyes away.  I've never seen any photo, even Ansel Adams' (which is magnificent) that have done his justice."
Half Dome,5.0,Unforgettable hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Half dome was one of our favorite hikes we’ve ever done.  We started at the valley floor and made it up the cables.  It can be done in a day, but it’s a serious hike.  Need to start before the sun comes up and be prepared for most of the day.  Take plenty of water and snacks.  Gloves and harnesses are recommended to go up the cables."
Half Dome,5.0,Iconic hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Half Dome is the symbol of Yosemite and perhaps the most recognizable feature in the park. You will see it from everywhere in the main valley. The hike through the cable route to the top is fantastic. It takes around 6 hrs up from Curry village. You need permit to climb in summer. In winters there's no permit as it is closed. But I went up anyways. 
Half Dome,5.0,Half Dome,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Half Dome is one of the icon in the Yosemite valley. It is a rock formation in the valley and it is a granite dome. One side is face and the other three sides round. It looks like a dome cut in to half and it is called as half dome.

Please read further and you will understand that this was a natural biological response to shear terror.  I can honestly say that I am amazed the park system actually lets people hike to the summit of half dome."

Yosemite Falls,4.5,Hard to miss this iconic waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Standing at over 2,400 feet (700M), Yosemite Falls is one of the main attractions in the park. It consists of three separate waterfalls of varying heights. Two of which can be accessed via trails in the park with varying levels of difficulty. If you prefer a longer and more strenuous hike to get a better view of the other waterfalls we suggest hiking the Yosemite Falls Trail which can be taken all the way up to the top of the falls. This hike takes much longer between 6-8 hours and is 7 Mi (11KM) round trip but allows you to see the top of the falls and the creek that feeds into it along with being able to overlook into the valley. However, most opt to hike Lower Yosemite Falls instead due to its accessibility. These Falls are near the Valley Visitor Center which makes it easy to access either by car or the free shuttle (Stop 6) that runs through the park every 10-20 minutes. During peak times in the park including midday and weekends expect long lines to enter the park, and board a shuttle. This trail is a very easy 1 Mi (1.6KM) hike that is on a paved road which makes it accessible for people of all ages and fitness levels. It takes you up to the bottom of Lower Yosemite Falls which is the last of the three that make up Yosemite Falls. Below there is a rocky waterway in which people often enter to cool off but be cautious of the cold water and strong currents during certain times of the year. This trail often gets very busy during midday and can be hard to get a picture without other people in it. Going prior to 11AM will allow you to enjoy most of it without having to deal as much with crowds and get a better set up for your pictures. We suggest planning your trip months in advance if you plan on visiting during the summer months. Most campsites in the park are reserved months in advance so the sooner you can plan and reserve a place to stay, the easier things will be. If you are a small party who lives within a drive of the park we recommend staying in Camp 4. During summer months they offer a lottery drawing of camp reservations for the following day. For 6 USD per person/day you can have a simple shared campsite in the middle of the park. Visit the parks website for the link to enter the drawing which requires a 10 USD application fee. Since you can only apply one day in advance this option is only ideal for people within driving distance of the park. Although it was rough making the 11 hour drive out from Arizona it was worth coming back to this park for a couple of days!"
Yosemite Falls,4.5,Wonderous!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Some people whine when the water is not flowing full blast, however I appreciate the way the Creator sculpted these beautiful Sierra and especially Yosemite. I love studying geology, so even when there is no water, there are wonderful things to see that are now exposed. The Valley is great year round, because of crowds, I usually go spring and fall. Don't let yourself be robbed of experiencing a beautiful place just because it's a low water year. I am mobility challenged and that doesn't stop me. I have been visiting Yosemite for over 65 years."
Yosemite Falls,4.5,majestic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yosemite falls consist of Upper and Lower fall, I think the Upper fall is more powerful, more impressive, but if you just look at the Lower fall, it is also beautiful and fabulous. You can see the falls in many spot, e.g. in the Cook's meadow loop, swinging bridge, Yosemite falls trail, Glacier point, etc. You can view the falls from different angles at different place, and it's worth to see the falls from different view at different place. It has the most water in the Spring and early summer, while the fall may dry out in late summer, so better plan to visit it in Spring and early summer."
Yosemite Falls,4.5,Beautiful falls and easy to get to.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visit Yosemite Falls on every trip to Yosemite, as it is a very easy, straight, paved walk from Yosemite Valley Lodge to the falls. We've been there when there is very little water in the falls and we've been there when the water is coming down so fast and hard that you get wet standing on the little bridge watching it. Since it is very simple to access, there are a lot of tourists in that area, so bring your mask (Covid).   Also, on the way to the falls, about midway, on the left are the Spider Caves. You can crawl through from one end to the other.  The path is rather short, but tight and you need a flashlight.  There is no marker for the caves.  We didn't even know they existed, until my kids went through them on a school field trip years ago. In summary, I can highly recommend visting Yosemite Falls."
Yosemite Falls,4.5,Fall from a good height,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yosemite falls is one of the main attraction for visitors in the Yosemite national park. It has upper level and lower level. The fall is highest weterfall in the park and drops down to more than 2400 ft. In spring season, the water fall is at peak. The top of Upper Yosemite fall is not easy accessible and can be reached via a steep, strenuous, and usually crowded 3.5 miles hike."
Yosemite Falls,4.5,Tallest Falls in North America - MUST SEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"In a park with so many amazing features, it is incredible that the tallest waterfall in North America falls to middle of the top 10.  In any other park this is the premier attraction, but this is why Yosemite is so incredible.  A March visit may mean some areas are not accessible but if you like waterfalls they were all pumping with a large volume of water.  "
Yosemite Falls,4.5,Upper Yosemite Falls Trail Review,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful! Upper Yosemite Falls Trail is HARD and can get very crowded in the afternoons. I suggest leaving as early as possible to avoid this. Our favorite viewpoint wasn't the at the top of the falls but the view of Yosemite Falls after the first round of switchbacks. We hiked in May and the weather was super unpredictable given the elevation gain. Definitely pack LOTS of water and appropriate clothing and hiking boots for the given weather on the day you hike. Lower Yosemite Falls is also beautiful but there is not much of a hiking trail to the base of the falls/viewpoint.
Yosemite Falls,4.5,Nature’s Stairmaster!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,This review is actually for the Yosemite Falls Trail to Columbia Rock.  
Yosemite Falls,4.5,nice but small waterfall due to the drought,4.0 of 5 bubbles,easy to reach fall with paved asphalt paths. the fall itself was small due to climate change and the drought that CA has been experiencing the past 2-3 decades. a visitor that I talked to that came to the park 3 years earlier said that the fall was about a 1/3 of its size.
Yosemite Falls,4.5,Upper Yosemite Falls,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I did the hike to the top of Upper Yosemite Falls 3 days ago. It's winter, but on my way back, there were still a lot of people going up the trail. I started this hike at 6:30 am, sharing it with only a handful of people and also beating the heat from the sun beating down on the trail. It's high moderate to low strenuous, but then again, I'm an avid backpacker, so that might not be a fair rating. I was able to do the hike, round-trip, in less than 4.5 hours. The best part of the trail is the views of the valley & Half Dome and then the views of Upper Yosemite Falls (about half way up). At the top, the views are just OK. But it's an almost constant uphill hike all the way to the top. My calves are still sore. I gave this hike 4 stars, as there were so many people on the trail coming up, when I was coming down. It looked like a line of ants. So, if you want to be on this trail alone, start very early, and you still won't be completely alone, but will have long sections alone."

Yosemite Valley,4.5,Amazing views - Don't rush through when driving,5.0 of 5 bubbles,When you arrive make sure you analyse the map you are given and plan your drive well so. you know where to get the best location stops and pictures. It is very easy to drive past a section and miss it. Take your time.
Yosemite Valley,4.5,Mesmerizing!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The park is absolutely amazing and the sites unsurpassed!!!  We stayed in the little camp, Curry Village  (last minute cancellation), which worked for us.  It is extremely crowded and impossible to park many times.  If there is something you wish to see without crowds, be there when the gates open and plot your sites logistically, otherwise can be a two mile back up to get in at the gate, and so crowded to park and walk around.  We ate dinner two nights at the Ahwahnee which was good.  Highly recommend their cottages to stay instead of hotel, but need to make reservations well in advance of a year out.  I found the park accommodations to be a bit run down and in need of TLC.  Definitely do a dusk loop car ride, see amazing wildlife, bears, deer, elk, etc.  Was also 115 degrees when we went, so hiking was too hard and the waterfalls dried up.  I'm sure Spring would be optimal."
Yosemite Valley,4.5,One of the most amazing places in the world,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the most amazing parks in the world. What ever you want to do is amazing. I love the early spring, April, May, the falls are going strong, attendance is less too. Lodging is expensive but location, location, location. When our family was young we spent many weeks camping, which they loved."
Yosemite Valley,4.5,One of the most beautiful places in the world ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's always an amazing adventure. Rt 120 is closed going into the park, so exoect delays. The park currently has a lot of water and flooding in the valley.  So make sure to bring appropriate gear. The plus about the water is that the Modesto river is spectacular, and the falls are flowing perfectly. Crowds are heavy this time of the year, so expect delays. The entry fee is $35.00, I have an annual pass and highly recommend getting one. Make sure to gas up before getting to the park. Enjoy yourself and the sites. "
Yosemite Valley,4.5,Bucket list trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yosemite doesn't have a bad view. Everywhere we went was incredible. We especially loved the various views of El Capitán from the valley floor. You do need reservations to enter the park and although we didn't have a delay entering through the west gate we saw a long line to get in as we were exiting through the south gate. Some parts of the park were kind of crowded but the farther you get from the popular spots, the fewer people there were. And no spot in Yosemite is bad!"
Yosemite Valley,4.5,Great sites to remember,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Travel during the pandemic was nice.  I wish he had more time to hike, but the sites along the drive were good enough for us for the first trip out here.  "
Yosemite Valley,4.5,Breath Taking Views and Family Time,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Family of 4 teens (18, 16, 15 & 15yrs) and a 10yr old and we ALL pushed our individual athletic limits from free climbing, simple hiking, and riverside fishing.  Beautiful and perfect for everyone of all ages and interests.  Loved this natural getaway"
Yosemite Valley,4.5,Magnificent Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Traveled to Yosemite last summer with my husband and son.  Amazing views and geology.  Go early in the morning as by mid-day there are tons of people making driving almost impossible.  Did not take the shuttle because of time constraints, but recommend the shuttle if you can. "
Yosemite Valley,4.5,Spectacular and Stunning Vistas,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This gorgeous area, in the heart of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, was the third to get its status as a National Park on October 1, 1890, and is still wowing every visitor today, even after 250 years. The Park’s diverse landscape supports more than 400 species of wildlife.  It is known around the world for its towering granite cliffs, its deep Valleys, the ancient giant Sequoias (that can grow up to 300 feet in height with trunks 27 feet across), Ponderosa Pines, massive Oaks, and its Waterfalls. It also helps that photographer Ansel Adams made it even more famous by his amazing, fiery sunset photos of two of its formations – El Capitan and Half Dome."
Yosemite Valley,4.5,Yosemite highs and lows,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I would absolutely recommend a trip to this national park treasure. The scenery is spectacular!  However a couple of items surprised me. We stayed in Curry Village in the platform tent which provided a Queen and two twin beds. It was clean and had necessary basic appointments. The density of the tents made for overcrowding at the 2 restaurants there so plan on eating early or late. Two other options for dining were not open this season which accounted for the long wait times. There was a nice cafeteria style breakfast option and a Peete’s Coffee. Bathrooms were adequate.

Glacier Point,5.0,Amazing Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Let's start with the only bad thing about this place (hence the 4 stars). I understand there is no sewer system there and that the bathrooms are non-flush waterless toilet system called vaults. I get that. But there has to be a way those bathrooms have to be cleaned at least every two to three hours, considering the amount of people that visit the place. Worst bathrooms I've been to in all my life."

Glacier Point,5.0,THE # ONE PANORAMIC VIEW IN YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This attraction/view will truly take your breath away!  And, it's accessible via road before you go through Tunnel View.  In fact, you may want to take the right turn at the entrance as you are driving in before proceeding further into Yosemite Valley.  Once you make the right turn, you'll drive some distance before arriving at this remarkable vista point.  "
Glacier Point,5.0,A good view point to see some iconic features of Yosemite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Glacier point is a high point so that you can see mostly of the Yosemite features at this points, including the iconic Half dome, you can also see 4 waterfalls such as Vernal fall, Nevada fall, Yosemite falls, they are majestic, you can go along the paved trail to see different view (at least 270 degree if not 360 degree of angle) of the Yosemite. Be aware  that if the parking lot in the Glacier point is full, then the road driving up to the Glacier point may be closed, so better go there earlier, but for the day we went (Monday in late June), there are still several parking space available at 10:30am, not sure if the parking lot will be filled up more quickly in weekends or in July/Aug, but in weekday of late June, still have several parking space at 10:30am. Of course you can hike up to here or from here, hike down to other points, but the trail is a tough one and takes several hours of hike. There are also ranger program in this site, I also post the photo of ranger program on that day, just for reference, it may changed from time to time."
Glacier Point,5.0,Spectacular views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I don't think I'll ever be able to forget how spectacular this natural wonder is.  Not to be missed.  It is almost as though one can't tear one's eyes away.  I've never seen any photo, even Ansel Adams' (which is magnificent) that have done his justice."
Glacier Point,5.0,Absolutely ridiculous rules,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"When you go to this park, you feel like entering a prison. ""You can't park here"" "" You can't poop here"", ""You need a permit to walk on this trail"", "" You can't sleep at this camping spot"" ""You can't park here, there, anywhere. Parking lots are to look at."" Not worthy. Beautiful nature but commercial park."
