Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Turned back on 3/20/21 due to ice,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have hiked to the fire tower a few times. Its a great hike, and not too strenuous elevation gains.  If the NO rangers are up there ( in the summer) they used to allow you to go up the tower. We had to turn back on 3/20 because of hard pack solid ice. We had our Katoohla micro spikes on, and solid hiking poles, and knew they simply  wouldn't be enough if the ice was on the steeper sections.  We walked into the trailhead because the access road gate is still closed. After deciding to cross the lot and hike Beech Cliff Loop, which was much more clear of ice, and has excellent views of Echo Lake and the ocean out toward  Southwest Harbor. We returned to BH to hear of the recovery of a young couple from Rutland Massachusetts  who had fallen 100 feet to their death on Dorr Mountain Gorge Trail. The tragedy attributed to ice on the trails. Anyone not experienced with full crampon travel, and ice climbing training should never attempt to hike or climb on solid ice. The danger is severe.. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Spectacular,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail was recommended in my Acadia travel book, and it didn’t disappoint. At several points, there are spectacular views of lakes below. Much of the “trail” is composed of granite faces or rocks, so you must carefully place your feet. I wouldn’t do this in sneakers. Even though the trail is only a mile, it took me an hour and 40 minutes. At the summit, there’s a fire tower you can climb for an even better view. Highly recommend."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beech Mountain Trail is one of my favorites in Acadia National Park.  It is located on the quieter side of Mount Desert Island with less hikers and more parking available.  This loop trail is rated at a medium level of difficulty (blue) and is suitable for both children and adults of all ages who are is reasonably good shape.  We chose to ascend to the top via the steeper portion of the trail.   Shoes with a good grip are recommended for hiking over the rocky sections.  At the top, the views of the surrounding lakes and park land are outstanding.  So, save this hike for a clear day.  The descent along the flatter section of the trail contains offers wonderful views of Long Pond.  Enjoy !"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Best trail in Acadia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stumbled onto this trail and were very happy we found it.  The trail is about 1.3 miles and is considered a ""moderate"" hike.  There are some steady climbs, but there are so many places to stop and look at the sights that you get time to rest.  The views of Long Pond and (I think) Echo Lake are phenomenal.  For hikers, this is a must!"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great trail for family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family has kids ranging from age 10 to 3. When we were in Acadia park, we struggled to find trails that aren't too long, too short, too steep, or too mild. After some research, we tried out Beech Mountain Trail. It turned out better than expected! The trail is not very long, but with decent climb with plenty of rocks (kids love those). There are a few open areas along the trail (besides mountain top) with great view to Echo lake to the east, Harbor to the south, and Long pond to the west. The view of Long pond is especially pretty. Our family cleared the trail in about 2 hours, with plenty of rest and playing as well. We feel this trail provides a nice blend of slope, rocks and views that are well suited for families. We thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Nice Views, Fewer People",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this trail in August.  There are two options for approaching the trail.  The shorter route involves a steeper grade.  A good portion meant climbing over rock.  We took this option on the way up and the more gradual trail on the way down.  My husband and I are in our 50s and were glad that we chose this route.   We felt that the more steep grade and rock faces may have been more difficult for us coming down.  We also felt that the taking the longer, less steep route on the descent allowed us to see the beautiful views of Long Pond more easily (as it was in facing us).  The fire tower at the top isn't used now.  You can climb up some of the stairs before they are blocked.  From what we read, there are certain weekends where the fire tower is opened to visitors.  The view from the peak and fire tower stairs is impressive.  There were other hikers on the trail but it wasn't over run.  It took us approximately 1 1/2 hours to complete the hike including rests and photo ops.  The trail is reached from Hwy 102 by Pretty Marsh Road and Beech Hill Road.  This trail is part of Acadia National Park and vehicles should have a park permit displayed while in the trail parking lot."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Good Hike in Acadia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Reviewed by a middle aged, overweight flatlander."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,A great climb!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose this trail because it was shorter for my younger children (8 and 11) and Beech Mountain has a fire tower at the top which intrigued my husband who is a fireman.  All of the National Park trails are well marked and this one was no exception.  At the top, a ranger was waiting to tell us anything we wanted to know about the tower and also showed us historical pictures.  My family all enjoyed this quick trek up a mountain and I would highly recommend it.  Some of the park mountain trails are full of tourists, but Beech Mountain is more off the beaten track so if you want to get away from the large crowds, try this trail!"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Not enough stars available for my review!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I loved this trail. A park ranger told us that it might be too difficult for us, with the ladders, but it was just right for us. The views were incredible. We hiked from the beach, to the top, and back around to the beach. We ended up doing it twice, so that everyone in our party would get the experience. It was away from the crowds that were everywhere in Acadia. This was my favorite thing in the park."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Beech Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Amazing views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When you arrive at the top there is a fire lookout so you can get above the trees. From there you can see the following: Sargent mtn, Acadia mtn, st. Sevaur mtn, flying mtn, sutton island, cranberry island, islesford( little cranberry island), baker island, southwest harbor, and northeast harbor. Every time we Come to Acadia we do this hike, but bring lots of water on a hot day."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,A skyline view,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We were headed to Devil’s Garden and made a stop here. It is a fairly quick stop even if you do the hike which is not a far or strenuous hike at all. No need to do the hike though because you can get a good view and good pictures from the pull off location.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Sunny at the skyline arch ☀️,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was our first trail we walked on and honestly our favorite spot to just relax at. We sat on the rocks back there just soaking up the sun for an hour and only three people walked back to see the arch. You can also see the back of the arch if you’re at the devils garden campgrounds
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Easy access to view arch  from short trail and can be seen close to parking lot,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a surprising stop to see a wonderful arch. We almost drove by this arch after hiking all day long but so glad we did. The short hike is .4 miles round trip and if you don't want to walk the entire way, there are many places to take a photo close to the parking lot. The blue sky was just perfect in the afternoon and this arch make us smile since it seemed to be tilted.  There was sufficient parking since people seemed to come and go. The path way was fairly flat. "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Short hike so might as well stop by,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"An easy 5 minute hike from the parking area. You get to see this arch up close. When I went there were a few people actually in the arch. They said they were able to get up there from the Devils Garden campground. I'm not sure about how accurate that is,  but it's worth looking into if you are camping there. "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Cool arch you can see from the road,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You can view this from the road, from the parking area, or by hiking out to it. This is a great arch for people with mobility issues or just those who don't want to hike. We did this on our way back from hiking Landscape Arch. If you do it that way, it'll be on the left side of the road. It was not busy at all when we stopped."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Arch in the sky,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail here is moderate, about half a mile round trip from Devils Garden Road. The arch is high up, hence the name. It was worth seeing, but I wouldn’t rank it as the most impressive ever given its inaccessibility."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Top Secret:  Best arch hike in the park...,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes, you can see this arch from the road.  It is pretty.  However, if you look carefully at the map, you will see that right behind the arch is the Amphitheater and the campground area.  If you carefully plan your course and have a sense of adventure, you can climb up to the arch and sit in it.  Start by the amphitheater parking spots, walk between the benches to the back of seating, then stray to the right (north, I think).  This is the best path so you don't have to navigate around any steep drops.  My kids (12 and 8) and my wife went with me and we all sat in the arch.  It is amazing, best pictures are in the morning, when the arch is lit by the sun.  There are places where it warns about disturbing vegetation and micro-organisms.  Try to stick to the big rocks and follow the trails of high traffic areas."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Skyline Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Skyline Arch is towards the back of Arches National Park and just before you enter the Devil’s Garden Trailhead area. This was a fun stop where we took about 5 minutes to walk close enough to get a decent view and get right back in the car.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Lovely and near the road,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You can view this arch from the parking area just before you get to Devil's Garden or you can take a short hike for a closer view.  It is elevated, so you cannot easily climb into it the way you can with some of the other arches.  "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Skyline Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Beautiful rock formation,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is another unique arch.  The hike is easy and there are many good viewpoints for picture taking. Worth visiting while in Arches.
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Fairly easy 10-miler,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the longest hike in Badlands NP. We did the Notch Trail at sunrise and got back to the car just as a downpour started. We hit the trail, (which is directly across the road from where the Notch and other trailheads are) immediately after the rain halted. The first few miles were a muddy mess but with the sun the trail dried up quickly. Bring water and some calories. We were fortunate that there was a nice breeze and it wasn't too hot that day. This is an out-and-back hike with the mid-point being the Fossil Exhibit Trail. There are restroom facilities there if needed. Retrace your steps and enjoy the day. There is also the Medicine Root Trail that loops off of Castle Trail and reconnects with it after a few miles. I read that it wasn't worth it so we didn't try that option. You may wish to consider that option however. "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Terrific trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As you can tell from other reviews, this trail is part of a network that covers quite a lot of the park.  I just did a short up and down hike starting at the Castle Trail trailhead and climbing up as far as the junction with the other trail.  It is a fairly steep climb, but nothing too technical.  Once on top of the ridge you have all sorts of options for scrambling up higher for even better views, or just for the fun of climbing around on big rocks.  Great fun."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Castle Trail,3.0 of 5 bubbles,This is somewhat desolate though it has quite varied topography.  It enables one to come up the backside of the Saddle Pass trail and avoid the steep trail.  I came back the next day and ran along the trail.  It was a good run.
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,This is a great trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family loved this trail. There are a few things to keep in mind. It is a 5 mile trail one-way. So if you walk the whole thing, you need to have an extra vehicle waiting on the other end, or it's a 10 mile walk. Also, walk this trail starting in the early morning or late afternoon, as there is very little shade. Take plenty of water! Long pants are definitely recommended."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Castle/Medicine Root Trail Loop: Great scenery but not an essential hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started from the Door/Window Trail parking lot and took the Castle Trail to the point at which it intersects the Saddle Pass Trail, we then took the Medicine Root Trail (and start of the Castle Trail) back to the parking lot to form a loop. "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Have hiked all over the Black Hills and Badlands...this and Harney trail #9 are the very best.  From the Windows/Doors/Notch parking lot trailhead to the Fossil Trail parking lot and back is 10 1/2 miles.  Go early in the day, and bring LOTS of water.  There is no water available at Fossil Trail.  For a shorter hike, loop back using the Medicine Root Trail."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Be prepared and enjoy!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great trail, indeed. Castle trail after half a mile or so connects to the Medicine and Root trail, which if walked in a loop back to the beginning of castle trail is 6.6 miles. "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Done on a cloudy day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Climbed Saddle Pass trail (15 mins), muddy in the wet.  Did the Castle and Medicine Loop. Medicine out less interesting.  Castle on the way back?  Totally loved it.  Well marked across the occasionally lunar landscape.  "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a relatively flat trail and the longest marked trail in the badlands.  I've hiked this one twice.  You visit many types of terrian.  From grasslands to the hills themselves.  Don't miss it if you have the time.  If you can have someone drop you off at one end and pick you up at the other.  Many great photo ops.
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Castle Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Fantastic Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked a portion of Castle trail; then took Medicine Root Trail back. We started at Saddle Pass Trail which was a hard climb to Castle Trail but so fun! We had our 12 and 11 year old with us and they did great. Better than I did. I used hiking sticks to get up and down Saddle Pass. That worked really well and helped with my footing. 
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,Not worth seeing,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Not much here to see or get excited about.  
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,Provisioning Outpost!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited the town on a trip to Big Bend National Park. It was a small town, but so interesting. There are several restaurants, a grocery story, gift shop, liquor store and well provisioned gas station. The people were super friendly and we left wondering how they survive in the heat of summer. The history of the area was fascinating! We saw a road runner, lots of birds and rabbits near the Starlight restaurant. If traveling to Big Bend, you will most everything you need in this small town!"
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,Not what expected,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Historically interesting-take the time to get a pamphlet from the general store and do the self guided tour. Hard to believe population was once over 2000 compared to about 80 now. A walk around the cemetery is interesting. As for Terlingua it might have been fun if I were a drinker to sit on the porch and have a beer. 
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,"North of the border, South of America",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I know what the map says, but I am still not sure where I was. Sort of like in a dream, lost in time, lost in space. If you are looking for something totally different, off-beat with an old-west/hippie feel, Terlingua Ghost Town is for you. You will either love it or hate it. Terlingua is a convenient location for exploring Big Bend Ranch State Park and the western portion of Big Bend National Park. Our group stayed two nights in the restored Perry Mansion. I was afraid it might be like Hotel California where “you can check-out any time you like but you can never leave”. We made it out! No ghosts in the cemetery (that we saw)."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,A Repurposed Ghost Town with Cool Cemetery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Terlingua is both a viable functioning community and a ghost town at the same time.  It is a ghost town because once in its history is was bigger than currently today and has abandon buildings from its time as a mining town.  However, many of those structures have been converted to restaurants, hotels and other service venues to care for the tourist that now come to see Big Bend National Park.  So much of what is called a ghost town is simply reconverted buildings.  The one thing that does speak to the mining past glory days is an old cemetery that as one has said perfect for pictures.  I visited the cemetery alone after our hike in the Chisos.  It was interesting to read about the old community and cemetery.  However, it was better to do what so many others had done to just walk through and take pictures.  The combination of an old cemetery with desert views of the Chisos and other Big Bend favorites make it great for pictures.  However, Terlingua is still very vibrant as we stayed here at the El Dorado and ate at High Sierra Grill."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,Ghost town and livable town all at the same time,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s a ghost town and a current town in one. There are places to eat, places to stay and things to do (mostly Big Bend NP). All of these things interspersed among ruins of an old quicksilver (Mercury) mining town from the early 20th century. The ruins are not labeled, but are pretty cool."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,Not really a ghost town,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I love hiking Big Bend National Park, and normally stay in Marathon or Marfa on the way down. This was my first time in Terlingua and I can't say I'd come back. It's an old mining town, and mining is still going on between Alpine and Terlingua. There are a lot of tourist trap type attractions and it's much bigger than a ghost town. It's not walkable. Roads to Airbnbs aren't paved and the restaurants and bars are not worth going to. If you're looking for nature or relaxation, this ain't it."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,Great Gateway to Big Bend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Charm and history and outdoor activities fill Terlingua. Good restaurants and saloons add to the unique sounds of this Southwest Texas town. Small but big in character and atmosphere. Lots to see and do before or after your visit to Big Bend. For the outdoors adventurer there are opportunities for hiking and rafting.
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,Not worth the drive,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I suppose our little family does what everyone else does and takes a trip to the Big Bend-Over (it was essentially closed) and also putzes about these little 'must -see' towns along the way. There is nearly nothing to do in the town except look at some old shut down mercury mines. The river is super muddy and kind of fast so it is not suitable for small children to swim in. The saving grace was the La Jajitas golf resort. We stayed there and it was a great stay with a really great restaurant. If you golf it may be worth checking out the golf packages but my 3 year old twins don't golf, yet."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Terlingua,Ghost Towns,4.0,COWBOY LIVIN,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Texas style wild wild west for sure. I stayed in a Bed & Breakfast that ran off a generator and had no indoor plumbing and I must say I had the time of my life. I go there often and leave feeling like Belle Starr every time
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Adams Key,Islands,3.0,Adams Key,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited Adams Key while on a sailing excursion in Biscayne National Park. We didn't spend much time on the key itself, it was basically a launching point for kayaking and paddle boarding through the mangroves. However, the key is nice. In addition to the boat dock, there are some picnic pavilions and restrooms."
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Adams Key,Islands,3.0,Pretty Spot for Lunch,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I took the Island Dreamers tour (permit holder with the NPS) and we stopped here for lunch. There isn't much to do on the island, but it was a nice half hour spot to eat lunch. There are tables beneath a shaded area to cool off after a few hours of sailing. We also saw a Cuban raft that the rangers had rescued... Made of Styrofoam. No kidding. There is a short walking path but it's overgrown and mosquitos reign. Overall, no more than a half hour needed on island. It's a beautiful spot."
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Adams Key,Islands,3.0,Very strong current!,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Hubby and I tried to moor our little 16 foot flats boat here today to use the public facilities but current was too strong to stop on the outside of the dock and only park rangers are allowed to bring their boats inside the dock area!  Public not allowed so that was a pain as I wanted to use the loo there!
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Adams Key,Islands,3.0,Absolutely horrible place with an advertised trail that doesn't exist. ,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"This Key is the most disappointing place I have visited on the keys. The track has not been maintained and disappears after a couple of hundred yards. The national parks service should be ashamed. The amount of plastics bottles and rubbish is disgusting, Don't go there. "
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Adams Key,Islands,3.0,Amazing experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a great day at Adams key. Very easy and good prices at the National Park. The crew was amazig, we did kayakingand snorkling at the key. Very recommended!!"
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Adams Key,Islands,3.0,Toilets!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unlike our last visit here, the water was calm enough where we were able to moor at the dock and use the toilets without getting bitten by mosquitoes. There is a small plaque about the history of the island and I believe you are allowed to camp here but there is really no other reason to stop unless you need a toilet break.  You can however only moor on the outside of the dock, as the inside section is set aside for park rangers."
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Adams Key,Islands,3.0,They have toilets here. No other reason to come.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"You'll be bitten by noseeums here. There is no reason to come here other than to use the toilet. No sinks, only hand sanitizer dispensers. "

Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Elliott Key,Islands,3.5,Great boating destination.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Great boating destination and a pretty neat place but bring the bug spray and bug gear.  Probably best visited November through early April.  They had flush bathrooms and showers which was a plus!
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Elliott Key,Islands,3.5,Elliot Key,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Planned a visit to go hiking on Elliot Key in Biscayne National Park.  The National Park Service does not have a concessionaire under contract at this time to take visitors out to the Key so you must locate and hire your own water transportation to reach Elliot Key which is approximately 7 miles off shore.  We contracted Tropic Sea Tours, (305-669-1645), which provide us transportation from the Homestead Florida Marina to the Key and back at a reasonable price.  The boat's captain, (Ed del Campo), made us feel right at home and provided us with drinks and snacks during our trip over to Elliot Key, (approx. 20 min. ride).  Tropic Sea Tours anchored their boat at Elliot Key and waited for us to finish our day hike, (8 miles round trip),  before taking us back to the marina for the day. "
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Elliott Key,Islands,3.5,Mixed Results,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Good:  A great location, fantastic views of Miami and very nice setting.  Visiting Jan through March is best to avoid mosquitos, bring bug spray.  Nice trails for exploring from Bay to Ocean side.  Recommend camping on on Northern point (furthest from Ranger station/restrooms), good breeze, views and fishing.  The Bad:  None of the regulations are enforced.  Loud- night club sized amps/speakers on back of boats blaring music so loud you can hear on opposite side of island.  This goes on daily and nightly into early hours of morning.  Generators going all night long, with cables everywhere.  The Park Service does not enforce noise ordinances at all or maintain restrooms.  Overflowing toilets are common and showers are not kept clean.  Better during week vs.  weekend part boaters.  Sad for such a great location"
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Elliott Key,Islands,3.5,DO NOT CAMP HERE OVERNIGHT,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"For the love of God, do not camp here. This place can be fine for day use only. That means you come here on your own boat or with a friend on their boat so you can leave. We took the 8am morning boat here from the Biscayne Institute (from the Dante Fascell visitor center) because no one made it clear to us how horrible the biting insects are on this island. That boat only makes one trip and comes back the next day at 9am. It also wasn't clear that there wasn't a beach to spend time on. I think there is one, but maybe it was just closed because of hurricane Irma. I don't think I would've used it anyway, because of mosquitoes and noseeums. Yes. During the middle of the day, in the sun, anywhere on this island. We initially thought we'd go for a hike along the 8 mile trail... Nope. Swarms of mosquitoes. On Dec 16. We were even prepared with long pants, windbreakers and mosquito head netting. They bit through my socks (which I had tucked my pants into). I was wearing smart wool PhD socks. Bit right through them. You have to wear long sleeves and long pants. When it's hot, that is uncomfortable. Deet might deter some mosquitoes, but noseeums don't care about deet. Around 4:30pm, the bugs (even out far from the mangroves near the farthest edge of the harbor) became thicker and merciless. Good luck getting into your tent without bringing a couple dozen noseeums and a few mosquitoes with you. They will then torture you during the whole night. Then there are raccoons that will come and try to break into your food supplies. The boat captain told us that they had figured out how to open very stiff latches on the 60 gallon lidded tubs he loaned us, so we had to tie them shut, as well. They didn't stick around long. I think the bugs were biting them, too. "
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Elliott Key,Islands,3.5,Elliot year round,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"it is by far the best place to spend a day on the clean bay water of Biscayne bay but its only for boaters or you must travel down to homestead bay front p. and take the boat for hire out there,for me its like a piece of paradise right in my own backyard its a bit costly because of gas ,food,the high cost to launch at the dade-county rapms,etc. would not trade it for any other place in all the years ive only had it rain once or twice a year theres no real natural sand beaches so you swim with a noodle or smal patches of sandy shallows "

Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Elliott Key,Islands,3.5,"Would be good, had the concessionaire not just quit",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Had planned to take a day trip out to Adams and Elliott Keys along with snorkeling.  However the park concessionaire had recently broken the contract with the NPS, leaving little else to do, other than the visitor center and the beach/board walk.  Was looking forward to the trip, but was out of our hands to do something else.  Am sure it's much better when everything is running.  The NPS hadn't even gone out for bids on a replacement, so it'll be a while.  "

Water was warm, no mosquitoes, great snorkeling in the mangroves (lots of mangrove snapper) and just a lovely relaxing day out.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Wall Street,Geologic Formations,5.0,very steep,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"it's s section of the Navajo trail, very steep, if you look down from the top, you may hesitate to go down, if you have knee pain, it will be very hurt to your knee to walk down so steep slope, so I recommend to go up rather than go down which would hurt the knees more. But of course go up may required more energy, but you can take certain stops in between along the way, take some pictures of the gorgeous scenery, drink some water and take a rest, it should be ok to walk up if you are not in hurry, we walk with 2 young kids, aged 3.5 & 6, they can finish the trail. For the ""wall street"" portion, you can finish less than 1 hr, but for the whole Navajo trail, may require 1-2 hrs. This section will be closed in winter."

We did Wall Street then continued to Queens court and back up to Sunrise Point.  We did this so we would descend the switchbacks of Wall Street and hike the more gradual incline out of the canyon.  This I one of the best hikes in the park in my opinion.  You get the slot canyon feel of Wall Street the floor of the canyon trees , the geological feature of the Queen’s court , then the vastness views of the canyon on the incline side."

This is a really beautiful part of Bryce Canyon.  It get quite narrow and the shadows and sunlight play off of the orange and reddish colors of the stones.  Do be aware that there is danger of falling rocks in this area.  The area can also be popular so there are often many other people in Wall Street.  Getting pictures without strangers in the background is difficult. The ground is often uneven and you need good footwear.  The hike to this area is not easy so be sure you are up to it.  However, it is worth the work.  It is a wonderful place.  My son and I loved this area."

The altitude made me breath heavy even with the smallest incline.  Be we were told over and over again that switchbacks are easier to deal with then a long accent.

If you walk down there, it's kinda easy to get there because you're going downhill. It's not super exhausting or dangerous or anything, it's just a cool experience. Make sure to not look down all the time but also back how the view is different and it's just cool to look down at first and then be down there. It's definitely a lot deeper than it looks! Going up is a bit exhausting I have to say. It doesn't look like it but all people coming up are breathing hard and I only understood when I was going up. But worth it!"

Go on a receding tide and explore the rocks for sea urchins, starfish, and lost lobster buoys. The point gives you a terrific view of the ocean as boats move across the horizon. Plan a picnic and let the kids explore; however, watch them as they get close to the wave action when the tide comes in. There are many clean tide pool (ice cold) that they can wade through and urn over rocks to find crabs. Read a book and let the worries of the day evaporate away as you pause to see a bird or the lobster men raise their traps. It is a very special place away from the Bar Harbor crowds. Incoming tides on a windy day provide fantastic wave action. HINT: If you like Otter cliff, seek out Wanderland for another ""not so well known"" piece of paradise. Senior pass."

It being my first trip I did learn a few things which I’ll try to pass on here."
Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),White Rim Road,Biking Trails,5.0,White rim canyon road trip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We just got back from this trip and it was a blast. The ranger at the station was very helpful in providing us information, but we never imagined it would be like it was. First, the scenery is second to none and there is more than enough thrills for the 4wd community without being outright treacherous to novices. I rate the difficulty as a 7.6 out of 10 and we did it in my 2010 Tundra. Some of the switchbacks are pretty tight but I only had to back it up twice around them. The road is bumpy and I should have deflated some air pressure, but we went in all stock and did ok.. Make sure your passenger isn't too distracted because they need to anticipate bumps and whatnot or could get whiplash fairly easily as my wife nearly did. Also, the steep parts around the hogback are not evident so you need to be ready to go to 4wd low at a moments notice or risk slipping backwards in 4wd high. Yep, a few parts are that steep. We were both bummed about no fires, but had our Coleman propane stove and the river was too high and fast to really go swimming, but all in all it was great.. I echo someone else's opinion about white crack camp site. It is head and shoulders above the others and off the main road a ways and could be easily overlooked, but make sure you sleep there for the night.. There's some unexpended old Winchester 300 mag ammo out there, just leave it alone and you'll find arrow heads and whatnot, leave that too and bring a telescope or binoculars for star gazing. I picked up a few plastic bottles along the way and added them to our trash, but again these guys take care of their parks like no one else in the country and it is clean and pristine out there, almost untouched. If you go out there do your part to help keep it that way and have yourself a blast."

This is a 100 mile journey that definitely required a 4WD vehicle...much of the road can be done with 2WD but the climb up from Potato Bottom over Hardscrabble Hill would be very challenging simply due to the inclines.  Having been to the viewing areas on Canyonlands, I can tell you that this exposes the park in way that you cannot see from above.  If you have a bit of adventure, you can see the true ruggedness and amazing beauty that Canyonlands has to offer by traveling White Rim Road. (For camping, backcountry permits are required.

Back country permits are required for camping and camp sites are limited and in high demand during spring and fall.  I spent some late nights on line getting the sites I wanted.  Also please note no camp fires are allowed along the road.  You have to bring all your food, water and other camping gear with you as there are no services along the road except for pit toilets.  you must have a capable four wheel drive vehicle with 4 lo.  We took our two high clearance Jeep Wranglers.  Also invest in a good tent capable of handling wind gusts and rain.  We experienced rain, wind, lightning and lots of mud on the west side of road.  Strongly recommend that if you want to drive this trail, you have some experience driving off road.  Driving conditions: steep and narrow ascents and descents, rocky road conditions up to nine inches high, slick rock, sand, ruts and mud.  Trip of a lifetime!"

The views were spectacular, with rock formations towering 1000 feet above us and the Colorado/Green River almost a 1000 feet below us at times.  The rock formations and colors were amazing.  I told my friends that it was so beautiful that it actually hurt my eyes...ha!  The terrain varied from sand, rock, gravel, mud, and everything in between.  We stopped to take pictures at several of the canyon rims, but didn't take too much time to explore.   It was clean, untouched, and remote.  We only saw 2 other vehicles in the 100 mile road and managed to get out by 7:00 pm.  Our bikes allowed us to make a slightly faster pace than a 4 WD but I would have still enjoyed stopping longer and exploring the area more.  It is probably the most adventurous, remote road that I had ever been on....the switchback road at the end of the road was exhilarating and fun!"

I even though about brining my Subaru Outback onto it. But now after I have gone through it, I absolutely have to say that you really need a high clearance 4WD to do the whole 100 miles.

It became quite miserable and scary as you put in 12 hours of biking (even with rotating driving) and the sun is setting. We actually did not make it to our camp as it was 9pm, pitch black and totally dangerous to go forward.... so we camped where we were / fell.  "

It seems everyone is hung up on if a 2 wheel drive car can make it , versus the incredible landscape and views. Im sure my Ford Explorer would have made it, but its much better with a 4 wheel drive vehicle. Watched a 2 wheel drive vehicle being towed from where it got stuck in a sandy, muddy section  near the beginning - was told a service call like this is very expensive. Beautiful landscape and views - we did all the must see spots. The road is very, very rough - slowed to a near stop so many times for rough spots. We were anxious to finish at the end, as the rough road beat us up.  A fun experience, with great things to see...a one and done however."

We almost got stuck in the sand,  ruts were huge, was like driving through deep slippery snow, we had 4x4 but definitely needed higher clearance. My poor car. Husband couldn’t let off gas or we would have got stuck for sure. 3-4 sections of that sand scared us enough to turn around. Wasn’t worth the chance of not knowing how the road was ahead of us so we played it safe and went back. Glad we did.

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Cathedral Valley,Valleys,4.5,Consider Avoiding the River Crossing,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I read many reviews and commentaries about this route both on TA and in various travel guides.  We did the traditional itinerary starting at the Fremont River crossing onto Hartnet Road and looping back down into the Valley on Caineville Wash/Cathedral Road, driving an Acura RDX AWD SUV.  The river depth was about a foot. You have to drive about 100 feet or so IN the river before you get to the exit point. Then there was about a quarter mile of very deeply rutted soft sand to traverse.  In our former Volvo V50 4WD we would have bottomed out I think and a passenger car would have surely been doomed.  The first half of this loop on the Hartnet Road offers some lovely vistas and views of weirdly colored mounds.  But portions of this road are brutally rough; very rocky with occasional fallen boulders to avoid and deep dips in the washes.  "
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Cathedral Valley,Valleys,4.5,Awe-inspiring,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There's a lot of myth about Cathedral Road.  If you ask the rangers about the road, they will suck their cheeks in and issue dire warnings about mud and advise against attempting it without a 4x4.  We drove this road in an AWD crossover with reasonable ground clearance, and had no real problems, so here's some practical info about the road.  One important point is that the road is mud, so is to be avoided during or after rain, whatever you're driving.  "

We rented a great SUV from a local RV park/fabulous store--good value. The adventure starts at the very beginning of the trail when you ford the Fremont River. For newbies like us, it was exciting. Then we were immediately immersed into a geological and biological heaven. Every turn of the road brought scenery so up-close it often just took our breath away. From the Bentonite Hills, down the easy switchbacks to Cathedral Valley, over white rocks, along dry washes (don't go if it's been raining!), from lush pinon/juniper areas to dry, dry desert with its abandoned uranium mining truck at an overflowing well, to the Temples of the Sun and Moon, and more!  Don't forget to take in ""Glass Mountain""--enormous crystals of gypsum glittering in the sun. It took about 6 hours, but we drove slowly, enjoyed the scenery and a picnic lunch."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Cathedral Valley,Valleys,4.5,Great ride and scenery but...,5.0 of 5 bubbles,ONLY attempt this route in a high clearance 4x4 vehicle.  Love visiting the Temple of the Sun and Moon and Glass Mountain - which are all located in close proximity to each other and look great no matter what time of the day you happen to be there.  With the parks closed more people may be considering this route and there are no park rangers to consut but do heed advice and travel this in the right vehicle - a passenger car will NOT be able to make the trip. No cell service and a tow will run well over $1k if you can ever get help. You will encounter some middling to deep sand along the way and some cavernous holes along the edges to avoid due to rain washouts and the spur road to the three attractions has a very challenging wash to cross which you should not attempt if uncomfortable with it.  Do not even consider this route if weather is not clear and dry.  This trip we did the shorter route in entering from Cainesville.  Its about 18 miles into the temples and then returning out that way.  Allow about three hours for the short round trip.  You will not encounter many other vehicles but be wary as this road contains many blind hill crests and curves.  There are no facilities on this route.
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Fruita,Historic Sites,4.5,Loved Fruita,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We camped at Fruita this week and loved it. Besides a gateway to all the attractions on the Scenic Drive through the park the Fruita area itself has many things to offer. The campground does not have power or showers but is well treed and is surrounded by orchards where you can pick any fruit in season for a marginal fee. We picked apples a couple of times and enjoyed mingling with the local deer population as they gorged themselves on apples as well. There are several hikes that originate from here and you can also walk to the Fuita schoolhouse and petroglyphs out on HW24. The Gifford homestead is also right near bye and has fresh baked pies and goodies but go early in morning for best selection. Amazing place.

As an engineer I was impressed by the amount of manual labor that went into developing the irrigation channels, which made agriculture practical. My wife and I were also struck by the relatively slow adoption of modern technology that occurred in the area, not having access to many ""modern"" amenities like paved roads, tractors, and electricity until AFTER WWII.

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Fruita,Historic Sites,4.5,Where the Action Is,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fruita is the center of activities and services at Capitol Reef National Park. The village is located on Utah State Route 24, about 10 miles east of Torrey and 36 miles west of Hanksville. Nestled in a beautiful canyon at the junction of the Fremont River and Sulphur Creek, Fruita was founded in the 1880s when Mormon pioneers settled there. The Gifford family homestead is now being operated as a living museum, with exhibits on pioneer history in the farmhouse and outbuildings like a schoolhouse and blacksmith's shop that are open to the public (spring through fall). Orchards with a wide variety of fruit and nut trees are grown on the grounds. Visitors are welcome to pick and eat all they like for free while in the orchard, and take some home for a small fee. Pies and canned goods made with the bounty are sold in the Gifford House shop. Unfortunately, due to the historic nature of the homestead, it isn't wheelchair-accessible. It also started storming when we visited so we didn't get much chance to roll around exploring due to the conditions."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Fruita,Historic Sites,4.5,"Another day, another ghost town",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fruita isn't just another ghost town in the Old West. It is unique in several ways. It was established my Mormons in 1880 for farming and grazing and growing fruit, not by gold seekers or prospectors for fame and fortune. And it is the only remnant of a settlement in a National Park. Located at the confluence of Fremont River and Sulphur Creek in Capitol Reef National Park in south-central Utah, it originally was named Junction, then became known as Fruita in 1902. It was named ""the Eden of Wayne County"" for its large orchards. But it was abandoned in 1955 when the National Park Service purchased the town to be included in Capitol Reef National Park. At its peak, the town's population never exceeded 10 families. Until the mid-20th century, it remained one of the  most isolated communities in America. Today, few buildings remain, except for the restored schoolhouse and the Gifford house and barn. The orchards also remain, under the ownership of the National Park Service, and include about 2,500 trees. The one-room schoolhouse, which was built and opened in 1896, instructed only a few students in reading, writing and arithmetic. The room also was used for balls and religious services. It was renovated in 1966. Meanwhile, protection of the orchards as a ""historic landscape"" remains a priority. The National Park Service employs a modern integrated Pest Management Program, which utilizes mechanical, biological and chemical means to keep the orchards healthy.

The pinnacles are quite the same in a much smaller scale. The trail is accessible on the southeast end of the lake at the end of the 7 mile turnoff. The trail is only .4 miles or .8 miles round trip. When you get to the main area where you park your car, just before you enter the trail, veer to the left and check out the formation to the right. In your naked eye, it looks just like a mountain. When you view it from your camera, if you have a vivid and functional imagination, you can actually see the shape of a face with the dark spires on top that forms the hair, and one other formation for the nose and the bottom that is shaped like an open mouth. I asked every passerby to look into my camera and asked if they can see what I see. They all agreed. So, take a look at the picture. This is a nice stop."

Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Wilderness Access Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,How to See Denali!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This great experience started with Rudy, one of the customer service reps whom I was lucky enough to reach when planning my visit into the park. Thanks to his guidance and efforts, my husband and I were successfully able to book an early morning bus excursion to Wonder Lake just a few weeks before our trip. He is a fine example of the type of service that is available at this company.  Like another Trip Advisor contributor, we walked an easy couple of miles to the WAC from the Holland America lodges, which are right next door to their sister Princess lodge facilities.  On the way, we encountered a tremendous moose, right there on the roadway. That is a rather common sight out there, and we understand that this particular moose is a frequent visitor to the same area--we think we even saw her the last time we visited the park a few years ago, when she had one of her babies with her! While it seems that she has gotten used to the many humans that she sees in the area, the idea is to keep your distance and use common sense. As she was very busy eating her breakfast and seemed totally uninterested in us, we moved as quickly as possible as far as possible away from her, and all was well. Just letting you know that there is a real possibility, if you walk over to the Access Center especially in the early morning or evening hours, you may be in for some bonus wildlife sightings!  The shuttle bus ride to Wonder Lake from the Access Center is terrific, with some of the most beautiful scenery that you will ever see anywhere, although it is a VERY full 11 hour day.  But, there are many different trip options, so you can budget your time accordingly. The bus drivers are wonderful and informative, and they make frequent stops when wildlife is observed in the area.  There are also stops at rest areas, but be warned: there is no food and very little water available once you leave the Access Center, so if you haven't done so already, stock up on provisions there.  The Denali National Park is, hands down, one of the premier highlights of any Alaska trip, and the Access Center does a terrific job of coordinating and running these shuttle bus adventures.  Just don't forget your food, your water, your camera, and your binoculars!"

Private vehicles can only go a short distance into the park. You must buy a park bus ticket to go as far as 95 miles into the park or to Eielson. I will tell you that the further into the park you go, the more wildlife you will see. Go early in the morning or late in the evening, animals are usually seen more during that time. I take the 6 am bus in. Many times people book spots but don't show up so usually has more space available for picture taking....I usually go into Eielson on the green bus. It is the one you can get on and off of to hike if you would like. If you are going to Wonder Lake be prepared for a bumpy ride with lots of mosquitoes at Wonder Lake. Bring food and bug dope. There is no food in the park. I got very hungry by the time we arrived at Wonder Lake!"

A must see for us to experience one of Alaska's largest wildlife reserve!  We were here in late August and it was snowing!  We booked the earliest bus tour, 6:30 a.m. to Wonder Lake but due to the snow the night before and the snow that morning, we did not make it only as far as Toklat.  The bus was 2 hours late due to weather and when we finally made it out, our driver John Nelson gave us a good narration of the history of the park and pointed out wildlife.  We saw a family of cubs with their mom, caribous, huge moose, sheep, etc... Mr John pointed out great points of interest in Denali and we were so thankful for his excellent driving.  It was snowing heavily and some of those curves in the park are dangerously close to the other side of the cliff!!! "

We were lucky to have a great person behind the counter help us coordinate free shuttles between our lodge and the W.A.C.  They have super clean bathrooms, faucets to fill your water bottles with clean water, a small info center, and a coffee shop.  No food or water is sold inside the park while on a tour or a shuttle, so if this is your last stop before hopping on a bus you should take advantage of the food and drinks available for sale.  It is also a good idea to arrive early for your shuttle to ensure a good seat.  Seats on the left side of the bus have better views.  Important to note that the W.A.C. is not the same thing as the Visitor Center.  A free shuttle bus runs between the two locations."
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Little Africa,Geologic Formations,5.0,Best Snorkeling in the Western Hemisphere!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"And that's because I have never snorkeled in the Eastern Hemisphere! Anyway, maybe a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much. As the other reviews has suggested, getting there is 99.9% of the difficulty. As an alternative, you might consider paddling via kayak. Caution - it is a six mile round trip and should be considered an open water paddle, only to be attempted by experienced kayakers. The Yankee Freedom II, the approved ferry to the Dry Tortugas, will take kayaks for campers for a small add'l fee (Do not think they'll take kayaks for day trippers. Besides too far of a paddle for the time allowed). Make arrangements far in advance as they can only take 3 to 4 boats per trip and they have to account for drop offs and pick ups. Also, please read directions and suggestions for kayaking on both the Yankee Freedom and Dry Tortugas National Park websites and plan to bring some gear you normally would not need to consider - marine VHF, GPS, signal flares, ditch bag with add'l food/water, anchor, etc. So getting the kayak to Garden Key is the first hurdle. After that, it's all weather permitting, which depends on current, tide, wind, and weather. I've only ever been out to Ft. Jefferson in the spring and it's always windy. I would NOT attempt the trip in anything over a 10 knot sustained wind. So assuming weather is a go, then it's simply a matter of paddling over in the morning, landing on the beach to the left (south) of the light house and dock, and walking a trail over to the other side of the key. You'll see the ruins of a dock with a ""Loggerhead Key"" sign - get in and start snorkeling. I felt comfortable going out as far as the marker buoys, making a lazy U turn back to the beach. The number and variety of corals and fishes is AMAZING and as the other posters suggested, you are likely to have the place to yourself. I was happy to see the corals and fishes seemed untouched by the Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill, though time will tell. Anyway, do yourself a favor and add this to your bucket list. Probably means you'll need to camp for two or three nights on Garden Key, which is primitive (no water!), but that in and of itself is rewarding. It's really magic after the ferry leaves, especially on weekdays - just you and a handful of other campers - and the night sky is PHENOMENAL. Don't forget the  saltwater croc in the moat (not kidding) or the huge Goliath groupers under the dock. I could go on and on. I've been to Ft. Jefferson four times - three times to camp, twice to kayak - and still have not done/seen all that I wanted to do, including snorkeling the wreck of the Windjammer Avanti. This is one of my favorite places on Earth and would be happy to answer any questions, so please feel free to reach out."

Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Long Pine Key,Islands,4.5,Best Bike Ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When I returned to the Everglades, I wanted to spend more time on the Long Pine Key trails.  Per the rangers May is the borderline for the insect outbreak, so I biked instead of hiking.  What a great time. While Shark Valley is more popular for biking, Long Pine is a much better venue. I began at 8 and finished the 14 mile round trip before 10, which included time to walk around the lake at the far end.  I started and finished at the campground.  The 7 mile bike accessible trail takes you through primarily a wonderful Slash pine forest but you also cross sawgrass prairie and Hardwood Hammocks.  On the far end there is a pond (did not see any gators in it) where you can get off your bike and take a break for water and food (bring with you).  The insects were not a problem at all but may have been if hiking.  The trail while in the wild is primarily along the limestone with some mud and plant material.  It is really fairly easy.  There are plants growing all around the path and stickers are present but I really did not feel them.  Saw looks of wildlife, birds, frogs, fish and a box turtle crossing the path.  Never saw another soul the entire time.  It was incredibly fun and peaceful as well as great exercise.  I would highly recommend this activity as one of the better things to do in the Everglades park, especially in the Pinelands."

My husband and I have been to Death Valley twice before, but never made the trek.  Finally, we planned a trip and decided this time, we would venture to the Racetrack.  I was so excited I could barely contain myself.  This is a dream come true for me."

My friend and I (lets call him Hans) walked out to the Grandstand, the temperature was about 110. After walking around the island we noticed a car coming down the road off in the distance. They made it to the parking area about the same time we did. We waved hello and the two men started walking out to the Grandstand. Then I noticed something. I tapped Hans on the arm and said.. Those guys aren't carrying any water. It was at this point I realized I left my phone on the rocks of the Grandstand when we  took a water break....F$%k!! So I drank another bottle of water and headed back out there. The two guys arrived back a couple of minutes before me and were talking to Hans. I got back and asked Hans, what was that about? Hans said, he was giving them each a bottle of water because they didn't have any."

Not many rocks left. The only reason these rocks are special is because of where they are located. When you get home they are just rocks.

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Scotty's Castle,Historic Sites,4.5,Research pays off!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Before we visit a national park, we always research the activities available.  When we read that Scotty's Castle was closed, BUT - on Sundays a guided tour was available for 13 people, we quickly reserved our seats.  We purchased our tickets in December for our April visit.  We traveled by 15-passenger van over the partially washed out road to the Castle complex. Our 2-hour tour included traversing the grounds from the main gate to the stand of palms, viewing the power supply from inside the generating station, walking in the courtyard between the castle buildings, and spending good deal of time inside the main room of the castle admiring the elaborate woodwork and beautiful tile work therein.  All of the furnishings have been removed due to the flood, but it didn't take much imagination to picture the grandeur that once filled that room. From the living room it was possible to peek into the dining room and the library - both characterized by the same beautiful woodwork.  Our ranger, who was conducting her last tour prior to leaving for North Cascades NP, was exceptional!  She regaled us with so much history of the Johnsons and Scotty that it was difficult to keep remember it all! Accompanying us was a member of the Death Valley Natural History Association, who also provided information and pointed out the water line from the flood, as it had destroyed some of the structures on the property.  All in all, we would say, WOW! to our tour of Scotty's Castle.  The combination of walking the grounds and hearing the stories made for an exceptional DVNP experience!"

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Titus Canyon,Canyons,4.5,Great Off-Road Motorcycle Adventure!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Was one of, if not the best, dual-sport / adventure motorcycle rides I have ever done.  Simply spectacular.  Perfect for moderately skilled adventure motorcyclists, though may be a bit too much for a novice on a heavy bike.  Would probably be fine for a novice on a light enduro, though note National Park rules restrict motorcycles to street legal bikes I think, which is good because it limits traffic.  Would be no problem in any stock high clearance 4X4, though longbed pickups may not be able to get around some of the tight turns.  On a Sunday at noon, I rode the whole trail and saw only one other party, a couple in a jeep, all of which contributed awesomely to the sense of isolation and wonder.  The ascent from the east is unremarkable, and one may think, ""What's the big deal?"", but then you crest a couple passes and you are blessed with amazing views down into the narrow valley falls that away from you.  Descending into it on narrow steep switchbacks through incredible, steep rock formations was so fun and visually stimulating.  Every 30 seconds, you are saying, ""Holy S***!"" Ghost Town!  Petroglyphs! After a couple miles of steep descent, one has the sense that you are about to emerge out of the valley, but you would be wrong!  The valley floor, essentially a large dry riverbed extends another several miles, narrowing dramatically.  Each new turn provides another seemingly even better view than the one just before.  Finally, you get dumped out at the end of the canyon.  I want to do it again!"

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Titus Canyon,Canyons,4.5,Must see,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stopped in to check out Titus Canyon after hiking at Ubehebe crater. After hiking up through the canyon about a kilometer or so we realized there is one way vehicle access down through the canyon from around Beatty. Unfortunately, we ran out of time and could not fit that in. But, we absolutely want to do that in future visits. Looks like an interesting and a bit freaky drive. Only a confident driver will want to take that road on I think. You'll also be driving quite slow the entire time. Allow for a couple hours if you choose the drive down option. Hiking in there was awesome  but be mindful of vehicles. You should hear them in advance. The sound is really interesting in the canyon."

Starts off as a rough, sometimes washboard road. READ the sign at the beginning. This is not a road to take lightly. They say high clearance 2WD is okay, but I used my 4WD Low for downhill sections to save brakes. It's a one-way road, so once you start off, you are committed. My average speed was about 5-10 MPH. Some steep and narrow roads, without much between  you and the canyon edge. Small gravel and sand made my rear end slip a few times. Nowhere on this road is easy. For us it was white knuckle the whole way, with the exception of the last few miles down in the narrow canyon."

Experienced hikers won’t find it to be much of a challenge, but you do get some beautiful views. It can get crowded, so we waited until later in the afternoon when most people were returning to their cars. (Of course we were here in January so late afternoon hiking was an option, whereas it would be too hot to do this hike in the afternoon at a different time of year) "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Golden Canyon,Canyons,4.5,Okay hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked only from the Golden Canyon lot up to the red “spires”. I think our timing was not good—it was about 9 am and in the high 80’s—so it wasn’t a comfortable hike. Once reaching the end, the red formations were not very vibrant— so for us the hike and final view was not worth the effort. We probably should have done some research on best time of day for lighting; or possibly we are just spoiled by some of the views in Utah’s NP’s."

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Golden Canyon,Canyons,4.5,Popular hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike begins from a parking lot (with vault toilets) off of Badwater Road, and it’s only about 3 miles round trip if you hike to Red Cathedral and back. It’s mostly easy, except for some minor rock scrambling on the spur trail to Red Cathedral, plus a rather steep narrow bit at the end. The views at Red Cathedral were nice, but the views further up Golden Canyon trail were better in my opinion, so if you have limited time skip the spur trail to Red Cathedral and continue up Golden Canyon trail for another half mile. There are steep drop offs, but as you climb higher you get much better views of the multi-colored golden hills. It’s about 1.3 miles one way and 700 ft. of elevation. "

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Golden Canyon,Canyons,4.5,So hot!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We knew ahead of time that an afternoon hike wasn't the best time to go but we did anyway. Be sure to pack plenty of water we nearly ran out. We got to a point near the end where it began going up to what looked like a pretty steep climb so thats where we stopped and headed back. The heat was just too much to put in that kind of effort. Still a great hike though

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,The Amazing Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I visited Death Valley in mid-May, just as the temperatures were starting to rise. I spent one evening at the sand dunes, through sunset and the experience was just amazing. Temps were in the low-90s even as the sun went down and it was actually quite comfortable walking around on the dunes. There are no paths, you just head out. I suppose if you tried hard enough you could get lost but it is highly unlikely. You can walk as far as you feel like, up as steep a dune face as you think you can handle. The next morning, I returned for sunrise which was, also, amazing. The temperature was ~80*F, again very comfortable for a morning walk in the sand. These sand dunes are my personal favorite part of Death Valley. But, please, be considerate, and keep your voices down. Part of the appeal is how quiet it can be in this park and no one wants to hear your conversation or listen to your children yell or cry."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Fun in the Dessert,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Death valley is full of surprises like sand dunes.

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Surf City In the Desert,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed a short trek across the sand dunes.  We saw little bits and traces of local wildlife like a beetle scurrying in the sand ,and a snake's tracks across the dunes.  After our short hike in to the desert, we joined a group of people who were sand surfing down one of the dunes.  It was a blast, but be sure to pick one that is high enough and steep enough for a good ride!  Otherwise you could stop halfway down, and be left high and dry."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,can see some sand dunes,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are several sand dunes area in the Death valley, but this one seems to be the most accessible one, after parking the car, you can walk a short while to see the sand dunes, you can use your camera to zoom it to take a closer look of the sand dunes pictures, you can also walk to those sand dunes, but it may take an hour to do so, as walking on the sand would be much more slower than walking on the normal road. How much spend here depending on how long you want to walk, how far you want to go. But as the weather is so hot, and there is no shade, it's better not to stay too long time there, or you can choose early morning or after sunset to come if you want to stay longer. Besides the sand dunes, the dried plants on the sand are also photographic."

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Hiking in the Sand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a cool place to checkout. I really like checking out sand dunes and hiking in the sand. The large dunes are quite a ways if you want to hike to them. We hiked about 1/2 way out into the dunes. We could see the large dunes and saw the ambitious people hiking to them, but we had a good view. October was a good time to go because it was only in the 70's so you could actually hike without getting Heat Stroke. This place is only about 1 hour from Beatty where stayed. I would check this out if you are at Death Valley National Park."

It’s crazy to look at the scale of some of these dunes. They’re extremely beautiful and you feel almost like you’re in a different world when you begin hiking through them. Just make sure you bring sunscreen and plenty of water! We did this is mid-August, so it was HOT but still a great time. "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Ubehebe Crater,Geologic Formations,4.5,can go if you have time,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"it's been a long drive from the visitor center to the Ubehebe crater, and the route is an uphill one. Once you park the car, there is a short walk, then you can see the big Ubehebe crater, when you walk along the edge, you may reach the little Ubehebe crater, but as it's hot, no shade, and even no person around, you may be the only one that walk, you may not want to stay there for a long time, so when I see the little crater after walking for about 10 min, I think that's the little Ubehebe crater, however, when I look back for the information and photos later, I find that I still need to walk for 10 more min in order to reach the real little Ubehebe crater. The hot weather really lower people's intention and ability to walk trails"

The crater is amazing. It is huge, and well maintained. It looks as if the crater was pulled and formed a second one. The trail around is the perfect opportunity to see the crater from all sides, but also get a birds eye view of the valley. There is no shade on the trail, so I would definitely recommend going early in the morning. It is a great add on for the Racetrack and the sailing rocks!"

This amazing place is worth its drive in itself and I highly recommend to hike the loop around the crater. Then you will be able to enjoy the area and still see both Ubehebe Crater from different spots as well as be able to see Little Hebe Crater. Enjoy this remarkable place. "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Ubehebe Crater,Geologic Formations,4.5,Cool Place to Checkout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a very interesting natural feature. If you like geology you will want to check this out. It is a volcanic feature that exploded thousands of years ago. We hiked to the small crater that is just up the hill from the parking lot. You can hike around the whole crater if you have at least a few hours I would guess since we did not actually do it. Even if you do not want to hike you can drive right up to it which is nice. There are no bathrooms here, just an FYI. I would definitely check this out if you have time to drive to the north part of the park. We stayed in Beatty, and it took about an hour and a half to get here."

I planned just walking around the crater, but we saw people were walking down, also we liked a lot more of walking down in grand canyon than walking along the rim, we decided to walk down part of it. It was very dusty due to loosen soil, I didn't feel more interesting while waking down, and I was worried about going up, we stopped 2/3 of the way to the bottom. After we came up to the ground, we think we shouldn't have any problem if we go to the bottom. I did notice people coming up in different trail, looked like it wasn't as steep as the one we took."

You can see it from the parking lot.  You can also walk down into it, but the uphill climb back up, I understand, is a little steep. I didn't go down.

I think it was the hottest visitor center in US, it can easily reach or over 100F, we came in June, it will be even hotter in July. There is a device showing the current temp. in front of the visitor center. The visitor center has some information about the park, also has basic faculties that you need. As the Scotty's Castle is closed during the time when we visited, we get only get some information about the castle by looking at the board in the visitor center."

The rangers are knowledgeable and happy to help you plan, plus you can get maps, souvenirs, and water bottle refills. If you stayed to watch the movie and explore the small museum, you could probably spend an hour or more here. But you can also just stop in, talk to the rangers, and be in your way if you don't have a lot of time. Nearby are where a lot of the park's amenities are too, such as a gas station, hotel, general store, and restaurant. So it's certainly worth a stop in this area of the park."

Get your tour guide newspaper and talk with the staff about any questions you may have of the park.  They have a good video of the park explaining the geology and history of the area that you will want to see to get a good overall knowledge of the park. The gift shop is one of the best national park ones I have been to in a long time and the prices are the most reasonable of almost any I have seen anywhere. There are picnic tables for those who want them.  The 20 Mule Team site is just up the road about 1 mile, so that is easy to access.  Badwater, the lowest point in North America, is about 1/2 an hour away. The Devil's Golf Course and Artist's Palette are on the way. The Visitor Center is a good way to start off any tour of Death Valley, plus if you are collecting National Park stamps, you can get one here."

Available, were a modest selection of Death Valley centric books, postcards, magnets, shirts, and several other items.  The museum section of the visitor center is closed in this era.  Rangers were available for guidance on hiking, as well as entrance fee collection."

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Furnace Creek Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,"The Views are Spectacular, the Park isn’t.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We planned reasonably well before our visit. We printed off their horrible map and thought it’s not too hard to navigate around the park. We came down from Northern Nevada and the northern entrance is closed as it was flooded out. So we automatically missed the northern part because we would not have time to backtrack to it. We came in at the entrance that comes from Beatty, Nevada. When you get to the entrance of this vast space, there are no maps, no Rangers and the kiosk does not vend the $33 park pass. The road immediately comes to a “Y” and, because there is no cell signal, we had no idea which way was the Furnace Creek Visitor Center. We came to another T in the road and ended up going west, not east and almost exited the park. You have to wait in line in the middle of the week in the middle of the day in order to get in a get a map that has any use at all. We saw the park, but had little time to get out of the car. One of the worst marked National Parks in the USA."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Furnace Creek Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Average visitor center,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I already had a NPS pass so I did not have to stop in. Went to Furnace Creek basically just to take a photo of gas prices at the gas station (over $8 a gallon when I was there). Since I went in June and it was hot, I was at the park early before the visitor center opened and had been able to pick up a map at one of the small information centers elsewhere in the park. Average gift shop. As usual, no plus size clothing as NPS doesn't think large people go to national parks. Restrooms were frustrating as it was not obvious if stalls were empty. Ended up skipping the restrooms. The one thing I did enjoy was the temperature shown near the front door."

They gave us great advice and we enjoyed speaking with them.  The film was very informative. They have a room with Scotty’s Castle information since it is still being restored.

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Furnace Creek Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Beautiful and Nature at its Finest,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Really fun day had in Death Valley National Park.  Stopped here first for hiking and park information and rangers were helpful and knowledgeable.  Make sure you get here early enough to enjoy the entire park and plan your visit so you can get the most out of your day.  Bring your own food in to eat - restaurants were not open and visitors center did have pre-made sandwiches and snacks but you may be better off bringing your food in.  We did a loop and saw the old gypsum mine, bad water basin, natural bridge, artiste palatte's look and dante's view for sunset.  Getting to Dante's View was steep and very windey.  It got chilley there too towards sunset - but beautiful views of the park and surrounding mountains."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Furnace Creek Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Park Rangers are Amazing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The rangers are terrific and very helpful - especially Betsy!  It rained (historic) while we were there and they kept us up to date on road closures and washed out roads.  The short film is well worth the viewing. If you have kids, definitely get them involved in the junior ranger program.  Small gift shop and get your US Park passport stamped."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,Colorful Hills,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Artist's Palette is an area where oxidized minerals have created amazing colorful hills.  There is a small parking area along Artist's Drive, which doesn't have many other places to pull over.  The hills are visible from the overlook, but we scrambled down and climbed around in the hills, there are a number of paths to get around.  It's absolutely beautiful, recommend arriving early or late in the day for best lighting.  A must-see if visiting Death Valley."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,Go in the late afternoon to get the best light for photos!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"About 4.5 miles into the Artist's Drive loop you will reach Artist's Palette.   From the parking lot several trails and walks branch out in a few directions.   You can walk towards the formations to get a closer view.  Or, what I did was walk up the hill kind of behind the parking lot and towards the road to get an elevated view of the formations."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,Highlight for my Teenage Son,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"That’s saying something, isn’t it??!  Given the difference between reviews for the drive and the actual location, a good number of folks don’t bother to walk closer to the Artists Palette. Unpaved and with some elevation, so not recommended for all to be sure, but if you can get down there and explore around a bit, what a fun spot for a brief stop, hike and photo-op. The colors are fantastic and if it was the most memorable spot for my 17 year old, well, it must be good!"
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,I Guess You Gotta Be There At Sunset,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It was cool, don't get me wrong. But as I put in my review of Artists Drive, during the day we visited the drive was more entertaining than the actual vantage point. I have seen, photos, however, and know how beautiful it can be. Maybe next time we will go for sunset. "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,"Pretty, but not sure we needed to stop",3.0 of 5 bubbles,We packed in a huge amount of sightseeing in a 2 day trip. I made hubby stop here as we were on the Artists Drive.
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,One of the Most Beautiful Places in Death Valley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My son and I drove out to Artist's Palette on our visit to Death Valley.  Artist's Palette is an area in Death Valley where the mountain side is many different colors.  The colors are created by the various minerals that are in the sands and rocks.  Most photos don't quite capture the colors.  Seeing them in person helped me to see how many different colors were there.  It is a very beautiful place and it is easy to visit in Death Valley.
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,A nice short drive from the main road ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The side trip from the main road to Badwater along Artist's Drive is a nice and fairly short diversion. Of course the highlight is Artist's Palette, which will only take a few minutes to view, and you can see it right from the parking area just off the road. The rest of the drive is pleasant and occasionally quite interesting as it goes through some of the tighter spots in this badlands area."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,Wonderful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Recommend taking this one way loop. The various colors of the rocks are quite impressive. The park was surprisingly busy between Christmas and New Years, so the stops in Death Valley were crowded. But the whole park is amazing."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,Good scenic drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice short drive off of the road to Badwater Basin. It's quite scenic and well worth the time to drive it and take a few very short hikes at pull-offs to explore the features. We saw it in the morning, but the lighting would be best in the evening or at least some time from mid-day on."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artists Palette,Geologic Formations,4.5,A must see,5.0 of 5 bubbles,You drive on a paved road around a mountain.  You can stop varies places to get out of your  car and take pictures and see the mountains. Ok drive but you can see these sites on main road  and then you get to the artist pallet.   Now you know why it was  worth the drive.  Unbelievable the colors  that are in the side of the mountain.  A truly must see .  Beautifully beyond words. There is a parking area and  you can get out of your car for a closer look.
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Nice little detour,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Photos online and the postcard that I bought definitely had me excited to see the artist's palette view. I was a tad disappointed since it's obviously not as vibrant or big as expected. Drive had other neat rock formations and was a nice little detour off the main road! Better than just driving straight but wasn't the must-see that I anticipated.
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Fun drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The colors of Artists Palette are very nice, but to be honest, I enjoyed the drive even more than stopping at the viewing area. There are tight curves and dips with beautiful scenery that make this a fantastic little drive."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Definitely Worth the Time,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a fun little drive!  My son videoed as I paid attention to the hills and turns. It doesn’t take too long so it is worth the time to drive through. Even better is to get out of the car at Artists Palette and explore a bit - that’s where the best photos come from!
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,"Very Nice Views, but Not Impressive",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I tried to be impressed, I just couldn't get it and most probably because of the inconsiderate and selfish people who walk on top or the the beautiful hills for?? photo or to say I walked up the hill...., but they destroy our views.... This natural magnificence meant to be seen from far not close up...... People."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Truly and artist's palette,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wow! This is really amazing to watch the colors blend together from aqua blue, to pale pink, to purple. The colors seem to be splashed on the mountains. Stop when you first turn in the canyon for some breathtaking views. Be sure to also stop at Artist's Palette for the perfect selfie. Walk on the mountains and pick up the different color sands. It is interesting, when you isolate the sand, it almost turns to grey. It is as if the colors only work when they are all together. Definitely worth the stop at this most unusual color canyon! "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,"Not just the colors, the journey is also a work of art",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wow! Didn’t expect this. Not only is the scenery beautiful (colors, rugged mountains, desert) but the road itself is a work of art! It’s single lane but wide enough and slow enough for an RV to travel on. I would recommend taking this in a passenger car because if you want to stop, the pull outs along the road are too small and the big rig would be blocking the magnificent views. If you can, drive a ways back from the car in front of you so you can take in the sweeping landscape and the swooping beauty of the road. The road is one way traffic, once you are on you are on for the whole 9 miles until you get back on Badwater Rd. Near the beginning are two viewpoints with lots of parking."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Good drive showing a lot of geology and scenic landscapes for all.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice side tour drive (short) to see some different aspects of this area of Death Valley. The high point is stopping at the Artist's Palette. This can be viewed right from the roadside, or you can hike down and around the area if you wish. The rocks vary from sedimentary groups to volcanics. If you are driving down to Badwater, make sure you set up some time (~half an hour) on your way back to take this side trip. You will be glad you did. "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Hard to describe how cool it is,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I guess I never knew/dreamed rocks could come in so many different colors, even more so right next to each other.  The drive is quick, winding, but oh so cool with the variations in size & shapes & colors.  Never seen anything quite like it."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Great Drive!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We took this drive and it was quite beautiful. The colors that naturally occur within the mountainside  are amazing and it is worth seeing it. Keep in mind that while the drive is short it is a one way street so you have to complete the full couple of miles.
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Artist's Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,There Is A Reason Motor Homes Over 25' Aren't Supposed To Travel This Road,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I knew this was the way to the famous Artist's Palette but merely driving the road did not prepare me for the spectacle that it was. There were various vantage points along the way including Artiste's Palette but the road itself was a phenomenal experience. The varying landscape, the changing colors, the different elevations made it an exciting and beautiful ride. Maybe even a better experience than the Artist's Palette itself. "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,Badwater says it all,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Everyone has seen the iconic pictures of the salt flats at Badwater Basin. While they do exist, be prepared to walk a long ways to get to them (a mile or more at least). Everything near the parking area is packed down, not what most people come to see. Despite all that, it is a spot in Death Valley you do not want to pass by. It is known for being the lowest point in North America (282’ below sea level). "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,Our first stop ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We left the Visitor Center and immediately headed to Badwater. There is a restroom and parking lot. It looks like a shorter walk out than it actually is, so take care if it is a hot day. We went in January with the temperature in the low to mid 70s so didn’t need to me mindful of any heat warnings. The area is huge so despite it being crowded over MLK weekend, we were still able to wander out a bit further and have some space to ourselves to enjoy. Be sure to look for the sign up on the rocks above you that says sea level so you can realize just how low you are "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,Amazing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,You can walk for miles out into the mineral flats and be amazed at the vastness of the flats. Out in the middle the prime is not far under your feet and makes for interesting crunching as you walk. The patters in the mineral ridges will captivate you.  It is hot out there so bring water and sun screen or cover clothing but worth exploring
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,Worth to take a look,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"it's  the point of the lowest elevation in North America, at 282 feet (86 m) below sea level. There is parking lot, after parking, you can walk the wooden board walk, there are some exhibition boards showing the information of this place, also show the points below the sea level over the world. You can also walk beyond the the wooden boardwalk, as you walk further, you will see more and more white salt, the salt near the wooden boardwalk has more dirt, as you walk further, the salt is less dirty, and can see the polygonal shapes formed by the salt crystals. If the weather is ok, not too hot, then may walk further, if it's too hot, in the middle of the day, then may not be good to walk further, as you may get dehydrated or Heatstroke. so there is a warning sign, warn people not to walk after 10am. So we went there in early morning, so we stay there for about an hour, walk further to take picture with the view of white polygonal shapes all over the view. We finish and leave that place at 9:30am. but even when you walk in morning before 10am, you still need to bring enough water and wear hat, use sunblock, etc. to protect from sunburn."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,"Beautiful at sunset, linger walk than it looks",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited for sunset and in winter. While temperatures are a beautiful 50-60F under the sun, the drop pretty dramatically when the sun sets. The walk was flat but uneven and longer than it looks. If you are unsteady on your feet, shoes with ankle support could be helpful. You should expect a 2 mile round trip to get to the flats and for parking to be scarce at sunset, but the views to be very worth it."
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,Awesome mixed with OK,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The idea behind it is awesome and to get that moment of being 282 feet below sea level... however... it was an absolute mad house of people everywhere, no parking, 30 minute wait for restrooms, people going off the trail and ruining the area and not even thinking twice about. My husband and i walked out for only about 10-15 minutes and were just saddened at all of the people ruining this area for generations to come. Parked along the roads and walking through the do not walk areas, arguing over parking spaces, it was just...not what we expected. The views were beautiful though. "
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,Lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Salt flats, which offer a surreal and otherworldly experience.

It was well worth the hour's drive from Furnace Creek reception.Be prepared for the heat and take water with you. Also a sun hat and sun glasses. Wonderful views and quite breathtaking. Difficult to put into words really. Just got to be done if you are in Death Valley. Stunning views. Lots of people walking there when we got there though.
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,This is why you go to Death Valley!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,You are 282 feet below sea level!. It is fun to look up on the hillside and see the sign that says sea level. The badwater itself gets better the further out you go. Try and get to a fresh area which shows the hextagons. Great to go when the sun is setting so you can see the pink and purple colors reflect off the salt. 
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Badwater,Bodies of Water,4.5,Salt as far as the eye can see.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the only place we went in DVNP on the Sunday before Thanksgiving that was actually crowded.  We had to wait our turn to take pictures with the sign and it was just a little difficult to socially distance.  Otherwise, totally gorgeous.  Realizing all those brownish-grey rocks behind us were salt was pretty mind-blowing.  Oh, and the weather was PERFECT!"
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Zabriskie Point,Geologic Formations,4.5,Magnificent landscape - a must stop in Death Valley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stunning landscape here.  If you are able to visit, sunrise and sunset in particular offer magical moments for photography and admiration of the landscape.

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Zabriskie Point,Geologic Formations,4.5,Perfect for Sunrise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is yet another spot in the park that is a complete gem! If you are looking for a great spot to view the sunrise this is it although it can get really busy! We got there early and there were still a ton of people however it is completely worth it. The rock formations and the colors on those formations is incredible. You will just stand up there in awe wondering how those formations and colors came to be. Definitely worth the drive and the very short hike to the viewpoint.
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Zabriskie Point,Geologic Formations,4.5,Amazing views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We walked up to Zabrinskie Point twice (an easy walk uphll from the parking lot.)

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Zabriskie Point,Geologic Formations,4.5,Gorgeous views ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The colors and views here are not to be missed. It is extremely popular so if you are going at a crowded time, it might be difficult to get that perfect picture without the crowds in the background. It is located along 190, which is the road into the park so we chose to do this stop at the very end of the day as we were driving out of the park.

We reached there in the afternoon and it was a good sunny day. This makes the salt deposits shine more and generate even better view. Consider visiting this place for sunset. (Its the death valley at its best)
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Dante's View,Lookouts,5.0,Made it there for Sunset!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although beautiful, I believe sunrise would be better lighting.

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Dante's View,Lookouts,5.0,Nothing Like It,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Death Valley is an incredible place and the drive to Dante’s View is worth it.  It is about 13 miles off the main road but is a regular paved road.  The last quarter mile is steep but not a problem in the car.  Long vehicles are not allowed all the way up.  This view up here looking over Death Valley is spectacular!  The winds are stronger up there and the temps are about 10 to 15 degrees cooler.  Highly recommend this stop!
Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Dante's View,Lookouts,5.0,Wonderful Vistas of Death Valley,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We drove up to Dante's View when we visited Death Valley.  My son and I enjoyed the drive.  It does take some time because it is a winding road, and near the top it gets pretty steep.  I think it is about a 15% grade right at the top near the parking lot.  We visited in May and the temperature in the valley was about 75 degrees.  The temperature at Dante's View was about 53 degrees so there was more than a 20 degree difference.  The elevation at Dante's View is more than 5,000 feet above the valley floor and the views are spectacular.  You can look down on the salt flats and see peaks on the other side of the valley.  "

Death Valley National Park,California (CA),Dante's View,Lookouts,5.0,The highlight of our Death Valley trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the most magnificent views you can experience in the United States.  You can just drive up into the parking lot and be treated to an astonishing vista that stretches for miles on the western side of the parking lot.  Just a short walk from the parking lot is an unmarked trailhead that you can take for a hike and we highly recommend this experience if you are up to the task and have a few hours.  The views become even more magnificent and an additional view opens up on the eastern side that is nearly as spectacular.  The trail runs the spine of the mountain, about 4 miles in one direction.  Of course, you can turn around whenever you so choose.  The hike will enhance your experience if you’ve already made the decision to drive up to this area.  Hiking Dante's View was the highlight of our recent Death Valley trip."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Slough Slog,Bodies of Water,5.0,Wow!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wow!  What an experience!   I learned so much from enthusiastic and informative Ranger Olivia (she was a FABULOUS guide!) during our walk through the water.   It was so different to see the flora and fauna while standing in the wetlands.    The highlight was observing the alligator hole (sans the alligator) and then actually seeing an alligator in a different area on our way out of the wetlands.

It was an amazing way to experience the Everglades!  The water was surprizingly clean!  In the ranger led adventure, the ranger will bring you out through the slough to a cypress hammock. The entire time, our ranger gave us information about the everglades and let us ask questions.  I bever would have done it without a Ranger.  At the end of the slog, we were wet to our bellies, but felt awesome and adventurous!"
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Slough Slog,Bodies of Water,5.0,Slogging-the only real way to experience the Everglades,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family and I had the opportunity to slough slog with a park Ranger.  It was amazing and the only true way to really experience the Everglades.  As you drive through the prairie of the Shark River Slough, you park your car on the side of the road and simply begin walking through the Everglades. In the Spring dry season there was little to no water on the prairie, still the sawgrass is still thick up to your chest.  You walk about 0.75 miles into the Everglades to a Cypress Hammock. There you experience the island habitat that shelters panthers and gators.  While we saw neither there was a gator path with fresh tracks that day that the gator had left that hammock. The hammock was also so cool to see the vermiliads growing in the cypress trees. We also saw lots of birds and baby grasshoppers by the dozens. The whole time we were learning about the Everglades flora, fauna and how it was formed and functions from the ranger. "

You'll need to be prepared with shoes that can get wet/dirty and pants that dry quick, but otherwise, you just walk into the water and it feels magical, exploring parts of the Everglades most people never see or experience."

Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Pa-hay-okee Trail,Hiking Trails,4.0,One of my favorite spots - beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I love Pa-hay-okee - including the road to get to the boardwalk.  There's a good bit of wildlife to see there if you go slowly and don't drive like a bat out of hades.  I go there often to photograph the wildlife.  Tip - if you see a photographer on the side of the road, please be courteous if you want to stop to see what the photog is taking a photo of -- you just might scare away a once-in-a-lifetime shot that he/she has waited hours to capture.  (This happened to me as I had waited two hours on the side of the road and was just about ready to capture the perfect photo when a family pulled up and started yelling, ""What do you see?""  And the kids got out of the car and began running over to me, yelling, ""What is it?""  Needless to say, the beautiful green heron was frightened and flew away ... )  My tip is that you can see so much more wildlife if you're courteous and quiet out in the wild."

The park ranger suggested we try Flamingo for there had been reports that the manatees were still around. And they were!! As soon as we parked our rental car we saw them lumbering around the harbor. It was such a wonderful experience. And, if you don't lose your receipt from the first visitor center ( as I did :(  ), entry is free within seven days of your last park visit!!! We rented kayaks and tooled around the harbor and then switched to the canal and saw alligators- adult and babies, birds, and tons of mangrove trees. The wind was on our back heading out so we left extra time to paddle back. We were out for about 3 hours and a tandem cost us around $48 to rent for 4 hours. We also saw osprey. It was worth it!"

There was plenty of parking, a lot of people where causally eating lunch throughout the area.  We were able to walk around the marina and were pleasantly surprised in what we were able to see.  Manatees floating around, a 14 foot crocodile sitting on a log and a large osprey nest with the mommy bird perched up there!  Some of Florida’s finest in their natural habitats was awesome.  We also enjoyed the short walk down to the bay and took in the beautiful water views.  This stop was the highlight of our day."

All the boats are new and well-stocked with cooking gear. Staff was helpful showing us boat operation and getting out on the water. Generator rental is optional. We rented one and barely used it since the refrigerator is propane operated, the stove has 3 gas burners, and there is a gas grill. We didn’t need the AC. I think the boats sleep 6, but there wouldn’t be much privacy with that many folks on board."

I learned thru other parts of the part that Flamingo area is the place to see crocs and manatees, two things I was unable to find other places in the park or Miami. The visitor center is now open and is amazing/beautiful but is only a short stop in your time here in my opinion. Walk by both marinas, behind the restroom/fish grinder near the waters to see the wildlife. If you are a little patient you may be rewarded. Try to avoid walking on grassy areas to help avoid mosquitoes and wear long sleeves with lots of bug protection! (picardin seemed to work best)"

Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Flamingo Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,3.5,Unnecessary to make this a destination when visiting the Everglades,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We recently planned a visit to the Everglades, with one day to get a brief introduction.  Having read a number of reviews on Trip Advisor, we determined that it as worthwhile to visit Flamingo after visiting some of the notable trails along the way.  Unfortunately, as noted in some reviews, the visitor center remains effectively a ghost town.  If you only have limited time to visit, concentrate on other destinations rather than Flamingo."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Flamingo,Neighborhoods,3.5,Disappointing Kayaking ,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did the Noble Hammock kayak/canoe trail.  First problem was making the reservation—the person handling the call couldn’t answer some fairly straightforward questions (found out later from the Flamingo Adventure people at the park that “oh yeah, we outsource that work, they are located in another state”).  Major charge in my opinion of $35 per vessel to transport the kayak and canoe to the trail in addition to the rental charge.  Was given very little instruction at the park from the Flamingo Adventure people, they said it was easy to navigate and would take 1-2 hours (1.9 miles total) which is what the brochure also stated.  WRONG!   It took us 3 hours, had no idea how many markers we were supposed to find, they didn’t put the boats in the water or help us in any way, plus we had to drive the life jackets 7 miles back to the site.  The first 45 minutes was OK but we realized quickly a canoe was not at all meant for this trail, you couldn’t even paddle through most of it, you had to use your hands to pull your way through the mangroves.  We were happy to finally get to the end (which they didn’t tell us was a different dock than where we started, would have been nice for them to clue us in on that).  When we finally got back to the site to hand in the life jackets, our first question was “when was the last time any of you were on the trail?”  They looked surprised and the one guy admitted he had never done it.  OMG.  I did let them know it was a terrible kayak experience and that for sure they should never let someone take a canoe on it.  For $120 it was a ripoff.  "
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Flamingo,Neighborhoods,3.5,Beautiful area of the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love Flamingo, its well worth the drive. The facilities are finally improving and the main Visitors center should be ready to open in spring 2023. We've taken our kids here and they love the wildlife. Each time we've been we have seen lots of manatees in the marina, some amazing in the views across the bay, and both crocodiles and alligators. Great parking options, there are plenty of places to to sop on the way. The back country boat rides are affordable, and its never been too crowded when we have been there. There is a marina store and temporary but smaller visitors center open right now, as park prepares to open the main center again."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Flamingo,Neighborhoods,3.5,"If you’re looking for wildlife, I would go elsewhere.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"During our February visit we saw relatively little wildlife in this area, especially compared to previous years. It takes  almost an hour one way from the park entrance to reach Flamingo. During our recent visits we saw nothing that would justify a two hour drive to see. Near the marina we saw a osprey nest and some manatees in the harbor but little else. In years past, there were large numbers of nesting osprey and other birds. There was usually a few crocodiles around. Again, during recent visit we saw very little. I do applaud the efforts of the folks at the food truck in Flamingo. Their food was quite good."

There are a few posters that give some information on possible animal airings and the difference between crocs and gators. The park ranger gave me map but I could not find the trail to possible find some gators and crocodiles since they can and do coexist here.  We did see several manatee is very murky water. The Florida bay was nice. We left pretty quickly. I hope they have upgrades coming.
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Flamingo,Neighborhoods,3.5,Great lodging at a beautiful national park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stayed in Flamingo Lodge, newly reopened.  We loved our accommodations—these are shipping containers, retrofitted to serve as sustainable lodging at the beautiful Everglades national park. Every unit has a peaceful and lovely water view, a very functional kitchenette with burners and utensils, a comfortable bed—all really nice and affordable. The Flamingo Visitor Center is a short walk away, with multiple daily options for guided birding and other walks, boating and kayaking tours, and other presentations. We loved our stay here. The on-premises restaurant is nice, with pleasant outdoor seating. Highly recommend."

We asked a ranger where to see wildlife, she told us to go to marina area to see manattees and crocodile. We walked to marina area, didn't see anything in the beginning. We walked around for about 10 minutes,  then we saw two nostils were above the water for about 10 seconds,  the head and body were under the water, so it was hard to see. Then we saw nostrils again near the area we just saw them for about 10 seconds, then it  disappeared under the water. A visitor was there for some time, she told me that there were probably 4 or 5 manattees in the water. I then walked to a bridge in the marina area, saw some birds. We were  looking at many saw fishes in the water, suddenly we saw a crocodile nearby, we could see the whole body. It was good."

We went to the open house hours.  There were a handle of guests looking at the exhibits and a staff member (Tom) on hand that was happy to greet each guest and give a summary of the history and exhibits.  As such, I don't think the ranger lead tour would be necessary but I'm sure was also interesting.  He also was able to answer everyone's questions.  It was a very worthwhile stop to understand more American history in an abandoned base that is still frozen in time."

They've done a great job of keeping the buildings, bunkers, and exhibits going so that you really get the feel for how things were when it was an active Army base.  The area around the nike missile has great descriptions of life during that time.  On the weekend, when we visited, there were volunteers telling stories as well.  There is a more formal tour if interested (though we didn't have time to stay personally).  You can get a feel for things within 10 minutes, or stay an hour or so.

Please be aware though that at dusk (perfect time to set up your photographic equipment without disturbance) the extensive mosquito population are looking at you as a welcome supper! Make sure you take EVERY precaution against these nasty bugs or they will eat you alive. (That last quote is from personal experience). Make sure you spray your clothes as well as any exposed skin and hair as you can get bitten through your clothes. Thankfully, if you take care and choose a clear night the photo opportunities are simply outstanding. We were also fortunate to see multiple Fireflies, an incredible sight."

There's plenty of lush vegetation to be seen, like gumbo limbo trees, air plants, and the crown jewel of the trail: the largest living mahogany tree in the United States The trail is self-guided, and the boardwalk is wheelchair-accessible. If you go in the summer beware of the mosquitoes on the shaded area that do not have a strong breeze. Bug spray will not stop mosquitoes completely from getting you. The best protection you can have is long sleeve and pants. We saw a few lizards, grasshoppers and lots of trees but none other wildlife. It is a nice well maintained trail.

Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Mahogany Hammock,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.0,Boring at best.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I expected more from the descriptions in the map provided at the Visitor Center. They really played up the difference in vegetation between minor elevations and really, it was all grasslands, with a puddle of water here and there. I hope this is a result of global warming, because I would've been really upset if I had to pay to see it. On the plus side, there are descriptive boards for teaching/explaining the topography to children, so it's educational. This is not the trail to view wildlife, it is more to view the land, the vegetation and the marshes of the park., so this is interesting if you're into the flora of a place.

The park ranger at the Flamingo center warned us, ""drive slowly and carefully, the police will write you a ticket as soon as you drive 2-miles over the speed limit"". We laughed about it, but we did drive according to the speed limit, which is 45 MPH most of the time when there is a speed limit sign. "
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Royal Palm Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Watch out for the vultures.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The parking lot has a flock of vultures that can and do damage vehicles. We found out the hard way. We saw the warning signs (Vultures may cause damage to vehicles) but did not fully understand the risk. The vultures tore apart the weatherstripping on our windsheild. We later learned a few tips such as parking in the full sun, covering soft rubber parts of the car with wet towels and creating distractions such as plastic bags sticking out of the windows if there's a breeze. We felt the Park Service did not provide adequate information at the Visitor's Center to convey the risk. We later learned that damage to cars is very common."

Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Good Place for Information and Gifts,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I stopped into the Ernest Coe Visitor Center before heading down to Flamingo. I’m glad I did! The ranger on duty let me know that several sites were closed either for the season or other reasons. I was able to plan out several spots to head toward. The gift shop had a good amount of books and souvenirs. There is also a small museum with some of the natural features discussed as well as local history including the Nike Missile Base. This is definitely where you want to start any trip into Everglades National Park.
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Great Park Rangers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the Visitors Center that is closest to Homestead.  You will see it prior to main Park entrance. It has bathrooms, some exhibits, a store and most important, very knowledgeable and patient US Park Rangers. They are very helpful and will provide you with maps of the park and great information. FYI- Seniors (62+) get a discount for admission to the park. "
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Anhinga Trail Guided Tour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So glad we started at the Earnest E. Coe Visitor Center. We saw Ranger Leon on a PBS National Park movie.  We found out about the guided walk at the Anhinga Trail from Trip Advisor! The walk is just a short drive from the Visitor Center. We were presently surprised to find Ranger Leon as our guide! It was an hour long walk/talk which Ranger Leon led. He has an obvious love of science and the south Florida area, and an immense knowledge base of the animals, birds, reptiles, trees, etc. His talk/walk was the highlight of our trip to the Everglades National Park!  He is great with younger children and engages them as his helpers."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Nice Visitor Center,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the main visitor center in the Everglades, so it can get crowded. It's beautiful though, with outdoor space and lots of information inside. Don't miss the map and geology/wildlife chronology before the front entrance. I stopped here after visiting the park, so I didn't need any specific recommendations, but it looked very organized."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Stop here before going into the Everglades NP,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We only stopped here briefly before spending the day in the Everglades park, but we were glad we did. One of the rangers saw that we had binoculars and asked what we were hoping to see. When he found out that we were birding, he took us to another ranger who was very familiar with the birds in the area. She gave us good tips on where to stop and look for specific birds, places that we would not have gone otherwise. I'd recommend stopping here to get some good maps and take advantage of the knowledge the rangers can provide."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Closed off for Covid,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Due to covid, there is a station outside where a ranger will give you a map and information.  The gift shop is open, but that is all.  There is a pond behind the building with fish and maybe an occasional gator.  The restrooms are open, so it is a good stop before heading off onto the roads in the park.  "

If you are looking for mementos, this is the place  to stop in the park, because some of the other centers are often not open.  Enjoy a full 10 minute conversation with someone who is checking you out and enjoy the lackadaisical feeling of this area, as a little bit of an entry point to the keys."

Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Anhinga Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,The Quintessential Everglades Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the most popular trail at the Everglades, and for good reason. It's easily accessible, and the wooden boardwalks let you walk above the water. You can look down and see wildlife including birds, turtles, and alligators. I was there early morning and brought my harp, and an alligator stopped to listen before swimming away. A once-in-a-lifetime experience! Take your time and walk to every nook and cranny of the trail. Then afterwards, stop by the Gumbo Limbo trail to see the tree canopies."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Anhinga Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Very informative,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the 60 minute ranger led Anhinga Amble. We saw a number of aligators, including one sunning himself on the trail, and frogs and many birds. The park ranger pointed out plants and animals, and not only told us about them, but also about the ecosystem and their relation to it. We came away with a much better understanding of the Everglades ecosystem and the plant and animal life in it.  I greatly recommend the free 60 minute ranger led Anhinga Amble at 10:30 a.m. daily."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Anhinga Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Don't miss this trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you only have an afternoon in the Everglades don't miss this trail. There is permanent water here so you'll see wildlife like birds, turtles and alligators year round. The trail is on a board walk so you don't even have to get your shoes muddy."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Anhinga Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Park is great! But beware of car theft!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The park is beautiful, and the trail is beautiful. This was our second visit. The first visit was full of wild life in the spring. This last visit a week ago had only a couple gators, which could be due to recent hurricanes."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Anhinga Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Amazing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Made a stop here on the way back to Miami to catch our flight home. So glad we stopped, this was one of the highlights of our trip to southern Florida! Saw 9 alligators right off the trail, lots of birds, fish, turtles, etc. Easy path and raised boardwalk. Restrooms available. It did cost $30 to enter the national park, but given the wildlife we saw, we felt it was worth it. Would highly recommended if you want to see alligators!"
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Anhinga Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Fabulous Trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived early on a Wednesday morning, about 8:30 before the visitor center was open.  The gates are open 24 hours. We had a lovely hour or two meandering the trail and taking photos of alligators, herons, anhinga, ducks, egrets,  gar and other fish, and lots more. There were other people there, but it was not crowded at all and great for taking pictures."

Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Anhinga Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,January is a good time to visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved our walk on the Anhinga trail. We were lucky that a park ranger was out about halfway, answering questions and helping point out wildlife. She also let folks use her binoculars, so if you have your own, I'd recommend bringing some; they definitely help. Yes, beware of vultures. There are some tarps at the visitor center right by the trail you can borrow to cover your car, but they are limited. "
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,"Love National Park, Hate Tram Ride",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a hard review to do as we love National Parks and the Everglades is no exception but we had limited time at the end of our vacation to go through so we opted for the tram tour. I could not book months in advance in 2019 as I couldn’t buy tickets for peak times of 11, 12, 1, and 2. Only offered for 9, 10, 3, and 4. We took a chance. The park was filled to the max many were parking on the road. You can pull in and wait in line as when parking is full it is one out one in. We called an hour ahead and they stated they had tickets for all times still but when we got there the next tram available wasn’t for two hours. We asked if we could get on a waiting list of someone didn’t show. I was personally treated horribly by the concessioner attendant. She stated I should have planned ahead as she doesn’t have anyone not show this time of year as they have been planing for a long time. I said it is hard to when you cannot buy online and she is like well I have many reservations right here so you could have. This is a total lie and completely inappropriate for her to engage me in that way.  In 2019 you could not buy any tickets for the times I mentioned. Now in the new year it appears they sell the first 20 online then the rest first come first serve. We actually did get on an earlier tram as she did work with my husband as tickets were handed back in. The ride however doesn’t give you a great experience. They don’t really show down long enough for anyone to appreciate the wildlife or scenery. If you want to take pictures it is very hard and you have to be quick. With my DSLR camera it was hard to have time to focus and snap a picture before we were moving again. Also the tram has a vibration that messes with that ability to focus. You have 20 minutes at the tower which is not long enough to walk the small trail and up the tower. We also had to listen to the last doing our tour talk about bicyclists not stopping for the tram A LOT. It got really old really quick. The tram just appears to be a cash cow operation. It isn’t quite comfortable to ride and doesn’t offer a personal experience. We walked the trails when we got back and enjoyed taking our time. If you go and have time in your schedule bring your bike or rent one and bike the pathway. It would be more intimate and on your own time. It is a beautiful part of the park and should be enjoyed."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,You don't need to do the tram!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to the Everglades a little last minute so by the time we even thought of Shark Valley, the tram tours were sold out. We did NOT want to walk the 15 miles to the observation tower so we opted for the shorter trails (Bobcat and Otter). Overall it takes like 2ish hours."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,Great gator sightings!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved our visit to Shark Valley. We saw a ton of gators of various ages and sizes, turtles and birds. We even saw a bunch of gator hatchlings in a little pool tucked by the side of the road at the end of the otter trail. We only had about 1.5 hours so we rented some bikes and hit the trail, and we were amazed at how much we saw even though we only got about 2 miles or so along the trail before we turned back. I would skip the tram - it's definitely more interesting to take your time and stop wherever you want for as long as you like!"
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,Great experience for up close wildlife viewing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ok, the bikes are past their best, but mine rode fine. I arrived just before the gates opened. Even though it was Easter Sunday, there were only a few other cars entering at that time and it was obviously the coolest part of the day. I booked a bike in advance, which might not be necessary if you go that early, but certainly is if you go later - by the time I returned at 11:30, there was a waiting list for bikes and people just had to wait for bikes to be returned before setting off. "
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,Really great nature trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We paid to get in ($30), rented bikes ($9/hr) and set out on the 15 mile loop, stopping off at the observation tower (where there are bathrooms and water refill stations).  Amazing amount of wildlife!  Had previously been on an airboat tour and saw only one alligator - here we saw probably 30-40 close up, plus a whole group of babies stacked on top of each other.  Lots of interesting birds, too.  A fun day.  Honestly, the tram tour looked very boring.  Definitely walk or ride for a better experience - you don't have to do all 15 miles to see a lot."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,The best place to start your Everglades adventure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent 15 min. waiting in line to enter the small car park near the visitor center. I was afraid that renting a bike would not be possible because of the queue to the park. My fears turned out to be unfounded. We easily borrowed bikes at USD 9 per hour. The whole loop took us 3 hours. Along the way, we got off the bikes many times to take a close look at alligators, turtles and countless species of birds. The feeling of freedom was fantastic, we were the masters of our time. If anyone doesn't have much time to explore the Everglades (we spent 3 days in the park), then Shark Valley is the most important place to see in addition to airboat rides."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,Abundant wildlife in Shark Valley!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We met up with our son at Shark Valley in Everglades National Park to visit and take a tram tour with a naturalist before sunset.  The naturalist tour guide was exceptionally well-versed on all the wildlife we saw, and the birds and alligators were particularly abundant at that hour (4-6 pm in February).  We saw numerous alligators, some with lots of tiny babies, egrets, cormorants, wood storks, herons, ibis, anhingas, osprey, purple gallinules, and even the shy roseate spoonbills...and much more!  There is a tower one can go part-way up to see long range views and a movie at the Visitor Center which explains a lot of what’s in the park.  It was a very worthwhile experience!"
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,Shark Valley (gators ate all the sharks),5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did not arrive at the entrance until 11:30 and the parking was full so we had to wait for 30 mins before enough had left.

Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,This is the REAL Everglades,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are so glad that we went to Shark Valley to get the real Everglades experience. It wasn’t that far from Ft. Myers and well worth the drive. We went early on a Monday morning because it can get get crowded on weekends during the winter months. Going on the 2 hour tram ride was the highlight. Our guide Ricky and driver Taylor made sure that we had the opportunity to learn about and see as much as possible of the terrain and wildlife along the route. Ricky gave us all the important information and Taylor stopped whenever she spotted something of interest. We saw so many alligators, birds, and special plants. These two young people are knowledgeable and passionate about the Everglades and made this a great trip."
Everglades National Park,Florida (FL),Shark Valley,Biking Trails,4.5,Great place for family bike ride with the gators!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Bike rentals were great.  The 15 miles is very doable.  Bikes were in good condition and we had no problem with them.  We did not have a reservation and arrived at 11am on a Wednesday with no problem.  There was no line at the NPS entry either. I'm sure that's often not the case during busier parts of the week.
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Tortugas Banks,Geologic Formations,4.5,flew over to Fort Jefferson/Dry Tortuga National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Had a wonderful 45 minute fight over to Dry tortugas!! Pricey but worth it.  We flew over from Key West Airport on Seaplane Adventures with 10 other passangers.  Saw lots of sea turtles, sharks, a couple of ship wrecks, a privately owned island, and had the best view of the Fort and surrounding area.  Highly Recommend Seaplane Adventures for a memorable time with a great pilot who did a lot of narration along with a prerecorded narration of some of the highlights of the trip.  This was through our comfortable headsets which reduced the engine sounds on the flight.  We enjoyed the snorkling by the old coal dock pilings on the north side of the island.  Saw some big fish and beautiful coral too!"
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Tortugas Banks,Geologic Formations,4.5,Simply fantastic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We took the boat over to the island. A sea plane is available but of course at a significant increase in cost.

Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Tortugas Banks,Geologic Formations,4.5,Well worth it…,4.0 of 5 bubbles,There are two ways to get out here. One is by boat and the other is by air. The boat ride is long no doubt about it but it is a part of the experience.  We watched the seaplane land and leave and quite frankly wished we had taken that option but the cost is considerably higher than the boat.

The plane ride was fantastic and kind of romantic...  The pilot's commentary was great (and appropriate).  We saw lots of turtles, sharks and wrecks on the way out and back.  How often do you get to fly over unbelievable reefs (the colors were fantastic).  Anyway, the flight was completely worth it!!!"
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Tortugas Banks,Geologic Formations,4.5,Best 'To See' attraction in Key West,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"So, to continue with the musings of my title... why isn't this listed in Key West attractions?  It was by far the best thing we did when based on there.  We took the plane, in the afternoon, and swallowed the price in the hopes of an unforgettable experience... the digestion was perfect.  An amazing trip... this is why you work long hours to spend your hard-earned money."
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Tortugas Banks,Geologic Formations,4.5,15 acres in the middle of the ocean,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We go every year we can.    The best time is when the water is warm.   Also take your own snorkle gear and DO camp at least 2-3 nights !    Check the surf and tides.   The best time to go is when the water is warm and the seas are calm.    We camp 4-5 nights.  Its not that hard to pack all your belongings including Tent, Tarp, charcoal, drinking water and enough to bathe with.    WARNING:  if a storm comes upon you suddenly, Do NOT stay in your tent.  Go inside the Fort and take a flash light.   You can Sleep on the cannons until the storm passes.   Your tent may be wet so Take Your Blankets and Pillows out of the tent into the Fort and put anything you do NOT want to get wet inside a dry place up off the ground.  If you smoke,  take a carton of cigs,  and a Good Camera.   There is no electric, running water or showers or Flushable toilets.    ENJOY!!!  We will see you there .......(Wish they wouldnt keep raising the price on the Transportation to get to the island and the Park Fees)   Remember,  this WAS a hidden secret.  Now most everyone Knows about it.   The More people the more destruction to the reefs and corals.       Do not touch the corals or take a live shell.  Leave the shells for others to appreciate.   IF you go in the Winter,,,,,,I would Strongly Recommend a Wet Suit and warm clothes.         BonVoyAge!"
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Tortugas Banks,Geologic Formations,4.5,Jewel in a Turquoise Sea,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Last March was our third camping trip out to Dry Tortugas National Park & Fort Jefferson.  Our first two trips were in 2001 and 2002.  At that time it was still not well known, except to the bird watchers, and not at all crowded.  Things have changed.  Interest in this little jewel of an island has increased over the years, though the Park Rangers do an excellent job keeping it as unspoiled as possible.  We use the park concessionaire Yankee Freedom  to get there. Stand in the bow of the boat as it flies over the waves.  It's totally exilerating!  The Yankee Freedom includes breakfast on the way to the island and lunch later on.  The trip takes about 2 1/2 to 3 hours and worth every minute.  When you first glimpse the island floating in the turquoise blue water with nothing around it for miles, it seems unreal.  As you get closer, you get your first glimpse of Fort Jefferson, formerly a Civil War Prison which housed Dr. Samuel Mudd, the doctor who attended to John Wilkes Booth's broken leg after his assassination of President Lincoln.  You can take a self-guided tour of the Fort or one led by a Park Ranger.  Snorkeling is great around the island.  Bring your own gear or Yankee Freedom will provide you with some at no extra charge.  The boat arrives at the island around 10 a.m. and leaves at 3 p.m.  That's when it gets great for campers.  The 300 plus day-people leave and the island belongs to the campers for the rest of the day and evening."
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Tortugas Banks,Geologic Formations,4.5,The Western End of the Florida Keys,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was my second visit to the Dry Tortugas.  Many folks who visit the Florida Keys are not even aware of its existance.  It is 70 miles west of Key West reachable only by boat or sea plane.  Both services are available out of Key West.  The boat trip takes about 2.5 hours, the seaplane about 30 minutes.  The main attraction is Fort Jefferson on Garden Key.  Pristine waters, good snorkeling, and abundant sea birds are a plus.  There are no accomadations in the park for visitors.  If you come by your own boat, which I do, there is an anchorage next to the Fort and a small campground for tent camping on Garden Key.  NOTHING in the way of supplies is available in the park: not a drink of water, not a candy bar, nothing.  If you're staying overnight you have to bring everything you need in and take all your waaste out.   If you come by the tour boat it furnished food and drink and bathroom facilities.  To learn more, check out the National Park website."

The Tarpin are incredible I have snorkled many parts of the Carribbean but never have we seen such large Tarpin..They were at least 8 ft long and 200 lbs. Breathtaking! Also, in July this was the only cool and refreshing water we swam in during our visit. Skip the fort and just swim!

Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Garden Key,Islands,5.0,A few things that haven't been said and Camping here leaves peaceful respect for the minimal simple life,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Husband and I camped, two nights, three days late October, one other camper on island, the three of us had the place to ourselves! Everything others have said, Fort, beach, sunsets, snorkeling, seclusion, fabulous. A few things that haven’t been said; Ferry has rolling carts to hull camping gear to site, one person can put stuff in cart while others go find a sight, (you can see ferry from camp ground so you never loose each other), 8 camp sites but lots of picnic tables, campsite tables are marked with numbers but it’s difficult to know what’s a campsite on your first visit, we took our time and looked at all the sights (I could see how this might be a mad rush if lots of people were camping, word of advice the morning sun will move so your sight wont be in the sun all day), the toilettes were nice, they even had electric lights (which I didn’t notice until the second night! So look for them), the ferry has lunch for sale each day if you camp, (had i known that I wouldn’t have packed food, good thing I didn’t know that - the ferry never made it back the two days we were there! Lesson learned, even though you CAN buy things like food and ice - don’t count on it.) We flew into Florida and didn’t want to buy a hard cooler, bought a cheap $6 styrofoam cooler from Win Dixi to keep ice, read about rats so brought plastic smell proof bags and limited our food to canned goods, when I saw others getting off ferry w/large plastic coolers, got worried about those rats! As luck would have it, the NPD has a small pile of coolers (left by others) at the bathroom, NICE! (grab one or two when you arrive and return when you leave) we put food in one and styrofoam cooler inside another, had ice for three days, no worries about varmints. We could see the rats moving across the open areas at night in a flash light beam but we never encountered one personally, however, it makes for an uneasy sleep to know the scurry on the other side of the tent is a 10” mouse, just saying.  The Moat Wall walk, fabulous! Walked it just before dusk, the waves were a bit active, didn’t occur to us they would hit the brick wall and come over! (Beware if the sea is active, waves are strong) we were soaked to the bone just before dark, with no fire, now you know! Had never COOKED with charcoal before, didn’t get the water hot enough to enjoy good coffee but it did a fine job on jiffy pop popcorn and cans of soup (we popped the top and sat the can directly on the grate). Took light weight sleeping bags and mats, even in late October the weather was warm we slept with no tent fly. Never opened our bug spray. Didn’t know Bush Key was open in late October, one of our best experiences, North side is a graveyard of corals, shells, and fans what a wonderful place!"
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Garden Key,Islands,5.0,WONDERFUL CAMPING,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We camped here for two nights.  First off, make sure you bring all of your own supplies as they provide only toilets and TP.  Camping here was one of the most wonderful experiences I have ever had.  After the tours leave at the daytime it is just you and any other campers (which isn't much).  We were able to watch the sun set from the top of the fort, then we walked around the wall at night where we spotted bio-luminescent jellyfish and in the morning we had the beach all to ourselves.  I will warn you, there are rats but they never got into our food or tents and we actually never saw any except the dead ones (it had just flooded prior to our arrival and they drowned).  We will definitely be back as much as we can.  Don't forget the following items: tent, chairs to sit on, water, favorite drink, food, towels, bug spray, cots/pillows/blankets or sleeping bag, automatic light up logs (like the kind used in fireplaces as it can get windy and you are not allowed to bring propane over), food that does not require cooking, and ice."
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Garden Key,Islands,5.0,The dreamy island?,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Upon arriving to Garden Key, are mode of transport was by sea plane. The moment I step my feet in the pearl white sand I knew I was on paridise. When on the island it seems as if rules don't matter. Apart from this feeling we have found many areas to jump off the rocks into the ocean. Around the fort is a wall with a moat in  between the path on the wall gives the effect of walking on water. Once getting in you can see perfectly clear as the water has stunning clarity. The area where you find the most sea life has gotta be by the pillars by the docks where you can swim in giant sea fans along side tarpon. The acctual fort was special because unlike most places it hardley has anything closed off and provides a panoramic view of the island and the sea. All in all this island was the highlight of are trip, and a memory that will never be lost."

Although tiny and hot, the attraction here is the fort (which has some neat history) and particularly the beautiful clear water and nice seaweed-free beach. We snorkeled around the moat wall and the pilings from the old coaling buildings, and saw giant tarpon and all kinds of tropical fish. Overall a really nice day and worth the trip!"
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Garden Key,Islands,5.0,Only Regret-not enough time there!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Dry Tortugas National Park (We took the boat-this is a full day if you take the boat as the trip each way is about 2 1/4 hours. it leaves early in the morning and returns around 5PM. They do provide breakfast, lunch, snorkeling gear and guides for a tour of the fort. ) We had a 45 minute visit to the fort with our guide shortly after we arrived, then lunch and time for snorkeling until the boat left at 2:45PM. We snorkeled around the fort and saw a school of fish and 6 barracuda on the side of the fort where the water was in shade. My only regret is that we did not have more time to explore the entire fort. You can camp overnight-conditions are primitive-but I think the additional time to explore the entire fort and island and to check out the stars in the night sky would be worth it."

We were not disappointed. It is a full day trip as it takes the ferry 2 1/2 hours to get there one way, so there is 5 hours of your day. The time at the fort is interesting. You can do the history tour, which I recommend, We planned on snorkeling, but the winds in the previous days had been strong and made the visibility cloudy. We took the rest of our time bird watching as the east side of the island is a bird sanctuary/rookery. The trip back the ferry opens the bar and we enjoyed adult beverages during the trip back.

Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Fort Jefferson,Historic Sites,4.5,Incredible Historical Structure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I visited and toured Fort Jefferson as part of my time at Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas. The first part of my time in the fort was on the tour provided by the Yankee Freedom Ferry tour guide. He was fantastic and brought that old ruin to life! The purpose of the fort was primarily to act as a deterrent against European aggression in the region and to protect New Orleans. The fort served a number of other purposes as well including a military prison. The size of the fort is truly astonishing as it’s hard to see the other side in some locations on the parade grounds. There are some cannon along the top of the fort. I was able to wander around most of the fort on my own which a really cool experience. Definitely take at least an hour of your visit to tour the fort before snorkeling and other activities.
Dry Tortugas National Park,Florida (FL),Fort Jefferson,Historic Sites,4.5,Rough ride getting there but beautiful once there ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unfortunately, our trip was cold and cloudy. The water was rough and choppy and it seemed half the ship was throwing up. We were disappointed and shocked to see that the Yankee Freedom ship was 100% packed during Covid. Absolutely no way to social distance.  Though everyone had masks, most people seemed to keep them off. Food was not good. At this price point, expected better quality food. The mixed drinks were good on our way back. The crew was good, did their best to take care of folks throwing up all over the place. At the Fort, rich history. Stunning views. Too bad it was so cold and windy to get in the water. That was a big disappointment. Other than that, highly recommend to do at least once. If you can get away with adjusting your travel for another day to avoid cold, cloudy, rainy, do it! "

Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Eielson Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,100% worth the four or so hour bus ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you've done any research on Denali you know that the only way to get way into the park on the park road is to take a bus.  The basic no-frills bus tour is the way to go.  While it is a school bus, the seats were comfortable enough.  I believe they made about four stops on the way there, with at least three having bathroom facilities.  If you book to Eielson you will stop there and can take any bus back.  I would take an early bus so you have as much time as you want once you get to Eielson.  The visitor center is really cool.  There is an easy short loop hike right at the center called the Tundra Loop Trail.  Across the street is another trail, Alpine Trail, that is much more strenuous as it is basically a straight up climb.  While I wanted to check out both trails, my wife and I decided we would check out the center for a bit, hike the Tundra Loop Trail, and eat our lunch and head back on the same bus we arrived on (our driver was really good)."

We saw moose, bears, and other wildlife on the trip, and our driver was nice and informative. We were exhausted at the end of this trip.  It was not worth it, given the fact that we didn't see the mountain.  (In fact, you couldn't even see the visitor center flag pole from the parking lot!)  However, only 10-30% of people ever get to see the mountain.  You came all this way, though, so you really have to try.  There is no food/drink available, so make sure you bring a sack or box lunch...it's a long day.  If you plan to hike, there are minimal trails from eielson.

You may also be treated to bears, moose, caribou, wolfs, beavers and other animals near the campsight. There is running water and flush toliets available too. You need take the park camperbus to get there but the trip in is great and the camper buses are usually fairly empty so you can easily look out on both sides of the bus.Take the early morning bus for best chance at great campsites.

You're better off just going to the Eielson Visitor Center (about 67 miles into the park). Much better views, and it's higher up on the valley so the bugs get blown away."

If you have a car you can park at either and then take a free shuttle back to your car. We wanted to see Denali so when asking around someone told us that you see it at the top of the ridge closest to the Mile 15 part of the trail. So we only hiked from Mile 15 parking lot to the top and then back down (it took about 45 minutes each way). I'm sure if you have the time to do the entire trail it would be a nice hike, but since we were short on time, we just did that portion. However, this is the steepest part of the hike. There are many switchbacks to get to the top. I would only recommend this hike if you are in good physical condition and have hiking boots or at least good running shoes. We were very fortunate because the day we did this hike it was clear enough to see Mt. Denali. Many days it is in the clouds."

Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Savage Alpine Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Majestic views, windy at top",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our family of two middle-age adults, a tweener, and an almost-tweener hiked this trail on a glorious early-July day.  We drove our rental car to the Savage River stop, parked in the overflow lot across the bridge and began our hike a little before noon.  The Alpine Trail is not a loop.  You can begin either at the river/bridge end (Mile 15) or at the campground end (Mile 13).  Hikers disagree about which end of the trail makes a better starting point.  Having completed it from the river end, I cannot imagine a better route than ours.  The first part of the trail is a steep ascent up granite steps.  (Caution:  if you're not climbing sharply within the first 100 yards or so of your hike, you're likely on the Savage River Loop Trail, not the Savage Alpine Trail).  The frequent rest stops up the initial climb gave us a chance to take in views that opened up almost immediately, including that of the river valley and Denali peak in the distance.  Although it was steep and generated some degree of offspring complaining (mostly about being too sweaty), the climb was not overly demanding.  A couple of gentlemen directly in front of us (then in back of us, then in front of us) sprinted up, treating the newly-constructed trail like a glorified StairMaster.  Once we reached a clearing at the top of the steps, it became very clear why Savage River is the one stop the Park Service recommends everyone visit.  The panoramic views of Denali and the Alaska Range, fronted by the park's river valleys, had that once-in-a-lifetime quality.  It did get very windy while we were crossing the ridge, and the kids made good use of the same fleece jackets, knit hats, and layers of clothing that everyone recommended yet had made them hot and their daypacks heavy earlier on.  On the way down, we continued taking in views, oohing and ahhing over ubiquitous Arctic squirrels, looking for bears, moose, goats (we didn't see any, though some other hikers did), reveling in our weather luck, and generally pondering how long it would take us to reach the park road we could see at the end of a seemingly very long and gradual descent.  Once we reached the flats, a short turn off the trail gave us a chance to play in the creek.  Bugs and mosquitoes were not a problem.  Overall, we took about 4.5 hours to reach the campground bus stop from the trail head.  The free Savage River shuttle was late, so we used our unused Toklat River bus tickets to catch a green bus back to our car.  The two mile ride on a nearly empty bus was enough to earn me many spousal points for making the right choice to hike this trail on our one full day in Denali instead of sitting much longer on a bus (any bus) to go further into the park."

We did go up a little further and had a good view of a small waterfall across from us. I have to admit, there are no trees, a rather flat, shallow river, and little in the way of geography to see, but it was a pleasant walk, easy to do on our first day out, and on our way back we saw one of the most elusive animals in the park--a lynx! We were told the next day that our friendly lynx was known to hang out around the area. So normally I would give this trail three stars, but if you have a chance to see a lynx, I'd give it four stars. If you like this review, please give it a thumbs up!"

Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Savage River Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Beautiful trail you can drive to.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since we didn't wish to sit on a bumpy bus all day, we drove into the Park as far as cars are allowed - which is the Savage River area. There are parking lots on both the east and west banks of the river, and this nice easy trail starts on either side. The trail loops along one bank, crosses over, and returns along the other. The scenery is spectacular of course, there are rocky crags you can explore, and you will see ground squirrels and marmots. You may spot Dall sheep in the surrounding mountainsides. On the drive in we saw several moose and a caribou. Very enjoyable substitute for that long bus ride."
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Horseshoe Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Lovely first hike in Denali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived at Denali late on a beautiful June afternoon and wanted to squeeze in a quick hike.  Horseshoe Lake Trail was a lovely introduction to the park.  The view from the top of the hill before you descend the steps toward the lake is stunning.  We loved seeing the beaver dam and getting to walk along the Nenana river.  It wasn't all that crowded when we hiked, and it was a great way to spend an hour or two."
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Horseshoe Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Beaver Paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a great hike for the legs.  We counted over 300 stairs but it’s well worth the calorie burn.  When you reach the lake make sure you turn down the short path to the beaver dam.  It’s amazing what they have built.  When you go back up the hill check out the fallen trees around you.  It’s hard to belief how many trees the beavers have taken down.  I thought this hike was one of the most beautiful ones that we walked in the park. Enjoy!
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Horseshoe Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great short hike in Denali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This hike leaves from the visitor center and is a 4 mile loop. The change in elevation is not great and the path is very easy to walk. The lake is lovely and when we were there there was a beaver dam and we saw the beaver. It was really beautiful and I would recommend doing this hike if you have time when you visit Denali.
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Horseshoe Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Good, not Great",4.0 of 5 bubbles,We were told that moose had been seen on this trail recently but I doubt it.  Pretty busy trail because it's conveniently located to the Visitor Center but that probably discourages the wild life.  A pretty walk in a great place but that's about it.  Better to go into the park if determined to see wildlife (although there is an amazing beaver lodge on the lake)
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Horseshoe Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Lovely walk near the Visitor Center,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice walk to take on a sunny day.  You descend many stairs to reach the lake level and, of course, have to climb back up those stairs at the end.  Otherwise, the trail is relatively flat.  You can take a spur to see a beaver dam.  It is a very scenic walk."

The only harder part was towards the end for us when there was an incline. There are nice views of mountains, trees and water throughout the hike. And the main lake has a pretty color even when it’s cloudy. We came here towards the end of August so it was a cloudy day with a very slight drizzle but didn’t feel cold. We still enjoyed ourselves and the hike. We didn’t see any beavers at the dam."

Healy overlook trail offers the chance to climb a rather impressive looking mountain.  At the base of the mountain the rocky face of the overlook stands out and appears much higher and grander than it is, making the hike all the more enjoyable.  I have hiked the overlook trail maybe nine times in the five months I spent in the park and everytime was an adventure.  Once atop the overlook it is customary to pose with the sign and gaze at ""Downtown Denali"" in the adjacent valley.  I would recommend this trail to the novice hiker."

At the top of the overlook, and to some extent on the way up, you'll be treated to stunning views of the Nenana River, and the mountains surrounding the park entrance. There is a social trail that continues beyond the overlook to the summit, and adds at least another mile (one way) to the distance, so bring plenty of water (1.5 L per person should be fine), a hearty sandwich, and a couple of energy bars, in case you wish to continue. We found that the views improved for about another half mile or so along the ridge, but the only point in continuing beyond that is the satisfaction of reaching the summit."
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Park Road,Biking Trails,4.5,Timed Entry Ticket for Denali National Park,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been anticipating getting a Timed Entry Ticket into Denali National Park this year. The sight indicates that they are available 14 days prior and it used to provide an example of the rolling availability. Based on that date we tried for tickets. You must first be logged in to the recreation.gov. My husband and I were at two separate locations trying with two accounts. You also must watch the 4 minute video. We were on the sight 20 minutes prior and kept refreshing the site and putting in how many tickets- in our case we selected (1) ticket using an interagency pass. You click the date and nothing happens or changes. The calendar indicates it is ""not yet available"" but we kept trying from 11:50 am-12:30 pm. The zero with a line through it appeared when you try to select any date. I tried calling recreation.gov and chatting for clarification on the process but waited two hours with no luck. I called the Denali NPS for help and no one knew there how to do it. They just said they ""sold out"" in minutes. We also tried yesterday just in case with the same results. This website and process in infuriating and antiquated. There isn't any indication on the site if the tickets have sold out or not. Terrible process. Our only option now is to buy a bus tour at 3-4 times amount this ticket would've cost it."

Denali is visible from several locations along the road, and we were fortunate that the weather was clear and we were able to see the peak. The road also traverses several of Denali's beautiful braided rivers and climbs up the treacherous Polychrome Pass, which offers expansive views of the gorgeous landscape below."

We went on the narrated Tundra wilderness tour.  Honestly, we love things like this, but this was boring.  It might have been partly because of the smoke from wildfires made the views just okay, we saw a few caribou, a dall sheep that was far away.  The driver spotted it, and put it up on the screens, which was cool.  I understand that they cannot control the wildlife, but even I dozed off, which is not my style.  Now I also have to add that we only went to mile 42 because of the washed out road, but if the rest of the road is as boring as the first 42 miles, they should probably just not repair the road."

The bus drives to around mile 43 where the road is washed out and turns around. You are able to get off the bus whenever you want and hop on another transit bus to pick you up. The bus drives on a paved road for the first 15 miles (cars are also able to do the first 15 miles) and then turns to gravel for the next 28 miles. The bus stops at restrooms. The driver does not have to talk, but ours did and even stopped for wildlife sightings. The entire ride is about 4.5 hours. The bus was uncomfortable. It had some scenic views. As for Denali, we did have glimpses of her. Based on research, better views come after the washed out road, which is unfortunate. We saw a few animals -- the easiest one to view without binoculars was a porcupine walking along the road. "

Some mountains and beautiful landscape was seen.  I didn’t see much wildlife.  We saw a movie at a visitor center that was interesting.  The commentary of our bus driver was good.  Sadly due to the smoke and how close we could get, Denali Mountain could not be seen.  I probably wouldn’t go back unless the road was fixed."

Caitlin was an incredible host and guide (it shows that her other job is a primary school teacher). She was informative, friendly, and the presentations were entertaining and fun. It was great to meet Mike and hear his stories on the trails and in the snow, and obviously most of all, meeting the stars of the tour, the dogs, was the real highlight. We had a great time and would recommend the tour to anyone in the area. It is especially convenient that they provide transportation to and from area hotels, and were very accommodating with rescheduling us. You even get to hear more stories along the ride to and from the hotel, and we saw a Moose. Perfect free bonus to the rest of the tour!

Handling the pups was fun as everyone on this excursion had a great time. However, I was not sure if I was attending a theatrical production of a sled dog kennel, or was it a sled dog kennel used to create a theatrical production? The presentation was a little over the top IMHO and do not appreciate it when I have to guess what is truth and what is ""part of the show"". EG...we were led to believe we got there ""just in time to see Mike take the dogs on a training run"".  With no snow on the ground, the dogs would pull an ATV.  And a few minutes later,  ""Let's check in with Mike on the trail to see how the dogs are doing."" Then a video of Mike talking to us from the trail on how the dogs were working...showing us how you turn the dogs left or right as needed. This would have been fine except he left the yard in a green ATV but the video showed a red ATV.  The dogs were fantastic, the production was a bit over the top..."

Total characters and full of personality. Amanda Otto, future Iditarod champion, led the first part of the tour and was genuine, knowledgeable, and friendly. Of course, the true star of the show was Jeff King, equal parts energetic showman, gritty realist, and humble champion. His magical ability to interweave humor, story, and fact makes for an entertaining and informative tour that leaves you wanting to know even more.

There are some things you can see at all of the big touristy dog kennels: dogs barking, cute puppies, dogs pulling things, etc. The one thing you can see only here is Jeff King, who in addition to having won the Iditarod four times is an extremely entertaining and informative host who does most of the tour himself. Both he and his staff (some of whom also do sled dog racing) stuck around well afterwards to take questions and sign autographs."

We went to the late show on our first evening in Denali and this set the bar for the rest of our visit.  One of the team picked us up at Denali Cabins (right at the base of the road to the homestead) and took us up to the show.  You start by getting to hold and pet one of the husky puppies.  They are of course very cute, and one of the key reasons people go to a husky show.  "
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Husky Homestead,Nature & Wildlife Areas,5.0,A must-do while in Denali,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an incredible short tour (only 90 mins) while in Denali. I wish it was longer to be honest. I learned so much about sled dogs, mushing, and what it’s like to compete in the Iditarod. As an animal lover, I was pleased to learn that the dogs are respected, treated well and cared for well. Jeff and his staff were lovely, and Jeff gave a great presentation that was awe-inspiring and also entertaining. I have profound respect and admiration for competitors in the Iditarod and plan on coming back to AK in March some time soon to watch the start of the race. As a bonus, we got to cuddle puppies!"

I mean, they literally meet you at your car door with a puppy... how can it get much better?!! The entire staff was so friendly, helpful, and just loves what they do. Jeff King was so entertaining to learn from about the dogs and racing. You can tell he is so passionate about what he does and everything was just so interesting to listen to and watch! I highly recommend this to anyone at any age. It is a must in the Denali area!"

If you’re interested in dog sledding or just love dogs and puppies you have to go! We were met with puppies when we arrived, and then they’re team told us about how they train their dogs and we got to see how they run on the trail. It was a blast and so informative! We also loved hearing about Jeff’s Iditerod experiences. Highly recommend for anyone!"
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Denali,Mountains,5.0,A bit disappointed.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The first National park I’ve been to that you can’t drive through the whole park. And the view of Mount Denali could be seen better and closer in the Denali STATE Park for free. You can go the first 15 miles by car, but if you want to go deeper into the Nat’l park, you have to pay for a bus tour. Park passes to self drive are very limited and hard to get. "
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Denali,Mountains,5.0,Denali and the Green Bus,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were a bit disappointed since we are more used to parks we can drive through, stop when we want and get closer views of wildlife/scenery. (Always keeping very safe distances from any animals, even the little ones.) Also, unfortunately due to Covid, the main and Eielson visitor centers were closed, although there was a Park Ranger stationed at each. "

He knew so much about the history of the park.  He spotted animals and stopped the bus so everyone could get pictures.  He did his best to accommodate everyone on the bus and take on new passengers as we traveled through the park.  He really made our Denali experience fantastic!"
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Denali,Mountains,5.0,Majestic scenery ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This park is one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. Unfortunately we were not able to see Denali the entire time but the park itself made up for it. We drove the 15 miles up to the point where cars can go. I would 100% recommend exploring the area near savage river and doing one of the trails. The wildlife here is amazing. While on a 8.5 hour bus tour our tour guide Sean pointed out a lot of wildlife such as grizzly bears and dall sheep. We also saw caribou and moose running in front of our car and bus on two separate days. The road in Denali is very slim past the 15 miles and if you get car sick do not look out the window on the bus tour. The rest stops along the way were all clean compared to the other ones we went to in Alaska. Denali is worth the drive.
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Denali,Mountains,5.0,Worth visiting,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Denali is very different from most national parks.  It is huge, there are few trails and you need to take a bus to go far on the one 90 mile road that goes into the park.  The entrance to the park is forest but a short trip in gets you to the tundra and mountains.  This is what there is to see in the park and it is spectacular.  "
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Denali,Mountains,5.0,Majestic!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the bus as far as we could, which unfortunately due to a landslide was not even halfway into the park, but we still enjoyed the five-hour round trip ride and the expertise of our driver and her insightful knowledge of the park.  No words can capture the immensity and beauty of it.  It's so vast and extremely wild that you are constantly in awe.  It was a perfectly clear day so we really got to enjoy many incredible views of the mountains, and especially Mount McKinley."

It is the tallest Mountain in N. America at 20,300 and some feet. I was blessed with sunshine. If it had been a rainy day, I would not have been able to see this beautiful mountain. So many Glaciers surround it. Alaska has 100,000 Glaciers ! The Denali Air pilot was so knowledgeable of the area and the Mountain."
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Denali,Mountains,5.0,Beautiful,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an amazing an unique place to visit.  We drove in as far as we could on our first evening and enjoyed walking along the river until the mosquitoes drove us back to the car.  The next day we enjoyed the wilderness bus tour and were amazed at the expanse of the part even though you get to see such a small portion of it.  Be sure to visit the sled dogs in the park.  They are a hoot, and it was fun to get to interact with them.  My only criticism of the park is that it is expensive if you are not hiking, and that limits the experience for many families."
Denali National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Denali,Mountains,5.0,Stunning,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We love to travel to our National Parks and would HIGHLY recommend Denali NP to anyone wanting to see a simply stunning park.  Obviously not as easy to get to as the lower 48 parks but well worth the effort.  The park has non stop views and plenty of wildlife along with trails ranging from easy to difficult. It's simply a stunning NP and the isolation of it adds to its character.   Wish it was closer!
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Garfield Peak,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best hike I've done in the U.S.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I've hiked in the Alps and climbed Mt Fuji and this hike up to Garfield Point rivals those other awesome hikes! Beautiful vistas all around. Two hours round trip with several stops for pics. It was a gorgeous blue sky day and we loved the hike.
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Garfield Peak,Hiking Trails,5.0,A must do in Crater Lake!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike definitely shouldn't be lumped in with other Crater Lake activities.  The view from the top is absolutely fantastic, and you get very good photo opportunities of both Wizard Island and Phantom Ship from various places along the trail.  The trail is about 3.4 miles round trip with an elevation change of about 1,000 feet.  It is rated as difficult on nps.gov, but we are probably in the range of mid to high in hiking ability, and found it to be more in the moderate difficulty level.  Allow 2-3 hours for the hike if you are similar to us.  It took us about 2.5 hours, but that includes a lot of picture taking and a 20 minute lunch at the top.  Departing from the lodge you first follow the paved path, and a prominent sign marks the trail as you switch to dirt.  The whole trail is well worn, so you really can't wander off.  We did the hike about midmorning on a Monday in August, and were glad we had finished the hike up and were coming down just as it started to get a little more crowded.  Stop off at the lodge and have a beer in the main room to celebrate your completion!"
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Garfield Peak,Hiking Trails,5.0,The one hike you must do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you only had one day in Crater Lake and can only fit one hike in, this is the hike I would recommend.  Wear hiking shoes, bring water, and carry a snack/light lunch to have at the top so you can stop and enjoy the scenic view of the lake and crater itself.  It is moderate-difficult in intensity but I did it while being 4 months pregnant and it was well worth it.  Views include Wizard Island, phantom ship, panorama of the crater and the lake.  It took us about 2 hours plus a 20 minute stop at the top for lunch and pictures."

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Garfield Peak,Hiking Trails,5.0,A scenic treat.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A comfortable walk to the top . The walk is moderately strenuous and preferred to be done early morning. Post 12 it can get hot based on the day. 
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Garfield Peak,Hiking Trails,5.0,Wear your boots for this one.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Garfield Peak is the 2nd highest peak on the park, so give yourself plenty of time doing this one as it is deceiving.  We saw snow even in June.  Views of the park were fabulous as you turned each corner.  This is not for the beginner or small children, but if you can conquer it, you will be glad you made it. "
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Garfield Peak,Hiking Trails,5.0,Great Cardio & Breathtaking views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the most popular hikes in the park. The 3.6 miles round trip hike provides panoramic views of the entire lake including Wizard Island and an overhead view of the Phantom Ship. The trailhead is accessed at the east end of the Rim Village, behind Crater Lake Lodge. As soon as you hit the trail you are climbing to Garfield Peak at just over 8000 feet. There is an elevation gain of 1,010 feet in 1.8 miles. It's the elevation gain that gives this hike a rating of strenuous. The wildflower season was pretty much over in September but there were a few hardy plants to enjoy along the way. We looked for pikas and marmots but they were apparently off doing other things. Plants and animals sightings are icing on the cake but the “cake” is the lake and the lake is spectacular. The 360 degree view at the top of the peak is so beautiful. Good shoes and water are a must. We always take hiking poles to save bad knees especially on the trip down. We highly recommend this hike."
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Castle Crest Wildflower Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Bountiful wildflowers and deer,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great stop on the east rim of crater lake.  We were there in July and the wildflowers were in full bloom.  So many varieties and colors along a short .5 mile loop trail along a stream.  Portions of the trail have water running over them; so, be careful.  We saw a couple deer and a spotted fawn grazing and they did not seem too concerned about people.  There are mosquitoes on the trail; so, be prepared."

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Castle Crest Wildflower Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Nice, easy trail but not really Medford",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail is actually called the Castle Crest Wildflower trail and is located in Crater Lake National Park which is about two hours from Medford. It  is an easy stroll but does have some wet spots part of the year. It is a great place to see and photograph wildflowers during season. You will find the trail just as you start on the east rim drive near the park headquarters and the Steel Visitoro Center.
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Castle Crest Wildflower Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Simply Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This wonderful, uncrowded, 0.4 mile (0.6k) loop trail starts with a short, gentle climb through a coniferous mountain forest that quickly opens up to a beautiful wet meadow with a number of streams flowing through it and carpeted with a profusion of wildflowers offering many opportunities for photography or to simply enjoy the beauty.  About two-thirds of the way along the trail, it briefly enters the forest again to emerge into a dry meadow with a different selection of wildflowers.  Due to the short growing reason, there is a rush to bloom and produce the next generation so there is a succession of flowers providing a constant floral blanket throughout the peak visitor season of July and August.  At the trailhead, there is a booklet, which can be purchased for a small donation, describing the wildflowers along the trail but we able to find many more that were not included.  The trailhead is accessed from the parking lot on the north side of the Rim Drive, 0.5 mile (0.8k) after turning right, to head east, at the Park Headquarters."

We enjoyed this easy hike along a flower-plant filled meadow and small creek even though most of the flowers had already bloomed.  The end of July and beginning of August is the recommended period to see the wildflowers in bloom.  We would definitely do this walk again."

The best times to go would be late July or early August to catch the purple Lupines in full blooms. Still, there are numerous other species blooming at other times and a gentle stream concourses through the castle Crest that is absolutely lovely. The trail is rated ""easy,"" so don't be afraid of huge elevation changes. Great parking nearby. All-in-all, one of the the nicest attraction of the phenomenal park! Lovely!"

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Castle Crest Wildflower Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Botanical Paradise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"A well designed and built little side trail for those interested in botany and/or wildflowers. It was pretty well spent in mid August as far as bloom goes, but still worthwhile to visit. A quiet area of the park, but no benches or tables, so just a short walk through several ecosystems. By short I mean 1/3 mile loop. We did see a few Lewis monkeyflower and Pearly everlasting still in bloom. If you come at the right time (third week of July usually), bring your macro lens and take some time to enjoy these gems."

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Annie Creek Canyon,Hiking Trails,5.0,Trail not to be missed in July,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I’m not sure how long the wildflowers are found on this trail but in July it is spectacular. This trail seems ho hum at first glance due to the upper rim walk is side by side the campground. Do the upper rim section first so you get to enjoy the sensational creek with beautiful wildflowers for the 2nd half. We almost skipped this trail. Instead it ended being our favorite of many truly wonderful trails (Cleetwood Cove, Sun Notch, Castle Creek Wildflower Garden, Plaikni Falls and Pinnacles). I’m older so we didn’t do the strenuous hikes except for Cleetwood. Of the trails we walked this was the 2nd toughest but definitely moderate. Bring your bug spray! We saw perhaps 7 people in total during our hike. I think many skip this one. It starts behind the Manzama Campground. There are toilets next to the village shops and the only gas station in the park. Great last hike out of Crater for yet another reason. Enjoy!"
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Annie Creek Canyon,Hiking Trails,5.0,Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked the Annie Creek canyon trail on our last afternoon in the park.  The majority of this trail is shaded so that is very nice.  Lots of opportunities for pictures along the trail because most of it runs right along the creek.  FYI the trail down and up is full of switchback and can be tougher but if you take your time you will be fine.  Also finding the trail head was not that easy but someone showed us if you start by the store behind the visitors center it will take you right to it.
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Annie Creek Canyon,Hiking Trails,5.0,An Excellent Morning Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed hiking this 1.7 mile (2.7k) loop trail on a crisp but sunny morning.  Taking the trail in a clockwise direction, which corresponds to the direction narrated in the trail guide that is available in a box at the trailhead, one quickly descends into a deeply cut canyon and follows Annie Creek downstream.  Having this trail virtually to ourselves, we saw only one other couple, we hiked along the beautiful alpine creek, through the forest, enjoying wildflowers, wildlife and the wonderful feeling of being immersed in the natural world created by the steep valley walls on either side.  Towards the end of the trail, just before the climb out, to the left, there is a series of interesting volcanic spires that are created by volcanic gasses percolating up through volcanic ash, cementing the ash which is then more resistant to erosion than the surrounding ash.  The trail is well marked and easy most of the way until it is time to climb out which is a moderately strenuous 200 foot (61m) gain in elevation but there are a number of opportunities to stop and catch one’s breath that offer good views of the interesting volcanic spires.  Alternatively, one could take the trail counterclockwise following the creek upstream and gently uphill which results in a little easier climb out.  The trailhead is located behind the amphitheater in Mazama Campground between loops D and E with a few parking spots among the trees along the E loop."
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Annie Creek Canyon,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best hike in the park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Just because it starts behind the campsites at mazama village don't be fooled; this easy trail leads to a beautiful meadow and winds along Annie creek.

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Annie Creek Canyon,Hiking Trails,5.0,Quiet Hike - No Crowds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to do one of the hikes not near the lake while at Crater Lake National Park.  We were very glad we did.  Annie Creek Canyon offers a moderately strenuous hike down to the bottom of Annie Creek Canyon and back up.  The trail is well marked and takes a little over an hour to hike.  There are views of the canyon, creek, pinnacles and generally lovely scenery.  The area at the bottom of the canyon is peaceful and quiet.  The creek runs through and there is soft grass to take a few minutes to sit on and relax.  I was amazed at how few people we saw on this hike.  Funny to be so close to so many people but practically alone on this trail.  If you stay at the park for more than a day definitely take advantage of some of the less traveled trails."
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Annie Creek Canyon,Hiking Trails,5.0,Gorgeous stream on uncrowded trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is next to the campground near the entrance to the park.  You must hike down to the canyon so the coming back up is what makes it moderate.  At the bottom you will be in a world almost alone (we saw two hikers) as you walk along a stream that affords opportunities for crossing on logs or rocks, or just cooling tired feet.  The walls rising on either side add to the feeling of isolation from a busy national park.  Another of the trails not directly related to the lake that are often overlooked at Crater Lake NP."

We chose to take the Annie Creek Loop Trail instead, since it was not a “view” hike but it was a creekside hike. It was fantastic! Beautiful flowers & lovely creek walk. There are 17 stations using the guide at the trailhead which are well done and most informative. We loved it, and the nearby Castle Crest walk was also stunning."

You keep wondering, ""Am I really going up there?""  The hike is steep but not aggressively steep.  You can see Wizard Island from the top, and you can appreciate the whole park from this vantage point.  We loved it.  You can also take a night hike with a ranger when there is a full moon.

The trip up is through hemlock and pine woods and in the spring is good place to see alpine wildflowers. The view at the top is the reward. There are wonderful views in all directions but it has one of the best unobstructed views of Wizard Island. This watch tower is touted as a great place to watch sunsets."
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Watchman Peak,Mountains,4.5,Amazing views at the top!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail is amazing and worth it. We hiked up there (with our two bunnies on their leashes) and it took about half an hour to reach the Peakman's look out. It's an awesome view and a great place to take a panorama shot of the entire lake. I wish we had been there for a sunset because it would have been spectacular. 
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Watchman Peak,Mountains,4.5,Worth every step of the climb!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Watchman Peak is a 8,013-foot mountain that is accessible by a 1.6-mile round trip hike up from the Watchman Overview parking lot on the Rim Drive.  The trail is rated ""moderate"" difficulty, but is really surprisingly easy if you take your time.  The fabulous views from the top are a great reward for the effort.  From a now-unused fire watch tower, great views are afforded of Crater Lake, Wizard Island (right below) and other mountains to the west and north.  Particularly good late afternoon, when the sun is low in the western sky.  Of course, you need a clear day for maximum viewing pleasure.  We expected the hike to take an hour and a half and we managed up and back in exactly one hour, including about 15 or 20 minutes at the top."

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Wizard Island,Islands,4.5,Gilligan!  It's a FIVE Hour Tour!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Crater lake is a unique experience, but the boat tour of the lake and 3 hour visit to Wizard Island is a unique experience within this unique experience!  You need to make sure that you have plenty of time to get to the Cleetwood trailhead (90 minutes commute time recommended).  For example, if you think of Crater Lake as a clock face, the trailhead is at 12-o'clock.  The Villages are at 6 O'clock!  Morning and afternoon departures.  $57 per adult, $35 per child.  Next, printout your boat reservation paperwork.  You can get reservations from the Lodge at Rim Village, or from the Annie Creek Gift Shop in Mazama Village.  Do not rely on cell phone reception in the area to display your paperwork. Present the paperwork to the ticket booth at the Cleetwood trailhead to obtain your actual tickets.  Next, carry bug repellent, sunscreen, a hat, a waterproof jacket and your camera, of course.  Wear sturdy footwear.  The boat is not covered, and there are no covered structures on Wizard.  The trail to the boat dock descends around 600 feet.  The boat ride travels counter clockwise toward wizard island (at 8 on the dial) and drops you off for 3 hours of exploration.  There is a fairly level but poorly marked trail to Fumarole Bay, and a well marked trail with a 750 foot ascent to the peak of Wizard Island.  The key to both these trails is sturdy hiking shoes, because both have relatively sharp volcanic rocks that tend to give way underfoot.  The weather is very changeable, so be prepared!  There are no meals or refreshments available on the cruise, but there are toilets (poorly maintained) on the boat dock and island.  Once you are picked up, the boat will continue on counter clockwise around the lake back to the boat dock on the rim.  Enjoy!"
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Wizard Island,Islands,4.5,A Volcano inside a Volcano!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wizard Island is a volcano inside a volcano! It is a volcanic cinder cone that formed inside the Mount Mazama crater that rises above the surface of the lake and forms an island. It's only accessible via the boat tours through Xanterra. When booking a boat tour, you can optionally add on a side trip to Wizard Island. The boat will drop you off at the dock about half way through the tour and then pick you back up three hours later. From the dock, there are two trails to hike and explore the island. The Wizard Summit Trail is a steep trail that leads up to the summit. It's only about 1 mile up to the top, but gains more than 700 feet in elevation. A series of switchbacks lessen the slope and you will likely be so enthralled by the beautiful scenery from the trail that you won't even notice. The crater at the top of Wizard Island is called Witch's Cauldron, in keeping with the mythological names of park features and the trail makes a loop around the crater. Dead trees line the crater - these trees were killed by dwarf mistletoe, a parasitic plant. The other trail on the island is Fumarole Bay Trail, which leads to the beautiful bay on the west side of the island. This trail isn't too steep, but very rocky and can be difficult to follow. Fumarole Bay is absolutely beautiful, with turquoise water the color of lagoon in Polynesia. If hiking isn't your thing, you can go fishing or swimming in the water near Fumarole Bay. Just be warned, the water is extremely cold - way too cold for me to get in. The boat tours and stops on Wizard Island are only available during the summer - late June to mid September - so be sure to get tickets in advance. This is a can't miss tour."

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Wizard Island,Islands,4.5,The ultimate in scenery and adventure on or near the Pacific coast,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"WIZARD ISLAND takes the form of a small volcano, with a tiny caldera, situated in the middle of a humongous volcano, known as Mount Mazama which has a humongous caldera, known as Crater Lake.  The tiny caldera on Wizard Island does not contain any pond of its own.  Wizard Island is actually not anywhere near the middle of Crater Lake.  Instead, it is near the western shore.  WIZARD ISLAND is arguably the ultimate in scenery on or near the Pacific Coast, because Crater Lake itself is beautiful, where this lake's majesty is enhanced by the symmetrical nature of Wizard Island.  Wizard  Island is beautiful, because the hike to the top takes you through a landscape of pretty brick-red colored lava cinders. "
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Wizard Island,Islands,4.5,A Volcano in a Volcano,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wizard Island is the volcanic cinder cone rising from the caldera that forms the bottom of Crater Lake and gets its name from its resemblance to a pointy sorcerer’s hat.

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Wizard Island,Islands,4.5,Plan Ahead. The Hike to the Top of Wizard Island is Worth Every Step!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I recently returned from a 10-day trip to Oregon and our visit to the top of Wizard Island was not only the highlight for that trip, but was one of the best hikes we have ever had the opportunity to do.  However, advance planning is required.  Also, please note that the boat trips to the island end in mid-August in 2016 due to upcoming dock maintenance.  I booked our boat trip 5 weeks in advance by phone for a July 4 weekend excursion and had several options to pick from.  That being said, the boats only accommodate 30 people each and there are a limited number of trips per day so it is best to reserve your spots as early as possible rather than hoping to get one of the spots they save for 24-hour advance booking on a first come-first served basis.

Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Toketee Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Beautiful Falls!  Strenuous Hike.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stopped to see the falls on my way to N. Oregon.  It was easy to find the parking area, although it is small (And wet from the leaking aqueduct).  There is a bathroom at the start of the trail, just in case you need one.  The hike isn't far, just under a mile.  But there are a LOT of stairs.  This is NOT a handicap accessible walk.  Make sure you take some water with you on a hot day.  There are a few benches along the trail, and plenty of rocks to sit on.  I did the hike with my dogs.  They loved it.  There were many other puppers on the hike too.  You MUST keep them leashed for everyone's safety.  The falls are just beautiful.  The overlook is at the top, with lots of space.  Many folks were climbing over the fence and climbing down to the bottom of the falls, but that is not recommended, and it is off-trail.  Well worth the walk.  Just leave enough time to rest along the way."

Firstly, the parking area is small, so come early to make sure you don't have to fight for a spot.  We did this hike as a family with our 3 kids (11, 8 and 5).  We didn't find it overly strenous but there are a few moments going up stairs where you're huffing a little."

I asked someone at our hotel about the hike, and she said it had maybe 20-40 steps. NO! It has about 100 steps upward one way and 125 the other way. Also, there are protruding rocks and roots on the ground. There is a fall risk if you do not have a good sense of balance. If you are in good shape with no serious medical issues, no problem. The waterfall itself is very nice, so go see it if you are up to it."

Less than a mile roundtrip walk to water fall.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Toketee Falls is another great stop on highway 138 on the road to Crater Lake from Roseburg, Oregon.  It was about an hour into our journey.  It is a good stopping point to take a break from the car.  There were quite a few stairs to the water fall, thus one will be walking up hill at some point on the hike.  It wasn't a rough hike though.  It is .8 round trip.  The more adventurous could technically go off the trail and get down to the bottom to see the falls, but we were not that adventurous.  I did see a rope that one would have to be strong enough to kind of pull themselves back up.  The view from the platform was really beautiful.  And the kind of punchbowl area before the waterfall is really pretty too.  There are definitely picture post card creating moments here.  There was also a bathroom."

Even with the Covid-19 mandatory mask restrictions (which did make the hike back up, a tad bit uncomfortable!) I would do it again tomorrow!

My significant other and I were in moderately good shape when we hiked this trail. Going back up after our boat tour was strenuous, but very doable. However, in mid-August it was packed with people who were not prepared for the hike back up. Many people had chairs/wagons/large bags (which I would not recommend, as there really isn't a good area for just hanging around/picnicking). We also passed lots of people in sandals/flip flops. All of these people were having a very difficult time. If you take the trouble to go all the way to the water, you've got to jump in! I don't care if its cold, do it! You won't regret it (or maybe you will, but I didn't)!"

I took my hiking poles and the down was harder than the up (because of the knee). Took us about 35 min down and about 65 up. Anyone in moderate condition or better can do this trail."

We did not know this ahead of time, but people jump off a particular rock near the bathrooms into the lake.  One guy did so when we were there and the water was brisk given his reaction.  This would be a glorious place to cool off on a hot summer day.  Bring a bathing suit and especially water shoes or sandals since everything is rocky.  I would have waded out onto the rocks if I had had the appropriate footwear. There are many benches to stop and rest on the way up, which was a bit strenuous for us baby boomers.  This was my favorite experience in the park."

The trail is pretty steep and is about a mile down and a mile back up. It is pretty tough coming back up in the sun, but I'm 62 and in reasonable shape and had no problems. The trail itself is in great condition. Our original intent was to take a boat tour...but they were not open for the Summer yet, so we decided to take a swim in the lake instead. It's tough getting down to the water because there are so many rocks, but once we got in the water...wow! So cold and so clear! It felt soooo good. Once we got back to the top of the trail, I wished I could go back down and swim some more. Highly recommended! Tips: Swim by the little shed where people dive off of the rocks. Also, don't do this hike unless you want to swim or take a boat tour as the views are not better than from the rim."
Crater Lake National Park,Oregon (OR),Cleetwood Cove Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Difficult but rewarding,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is obviously an easy hike down and a difficult hike back up.  But it is very much well worth it.  We walked down in the morning and spent a hour or so hanging out by the lake.  Unfortunately the boats were not running so that was all we could do.

We had great weather. Only complaint was the food at the lodge.   You are a very captive audience when it comes to food. You make the lodge reservation many months in advance but the restaurant  reservation cannot be made until a week before you arrive.   Does that make sense?      Our first dinner, we  each had a salad then decided to share the Steelhead.   When the plate arrived, the fish was over cooked and luke warm, the brussel sprouts were under cooked and cold and rice was cold.  We should have sent it back but instead we ate some of it.     A huge disappointment.       Maybe management need to check who was in the kitchen on 10/3 and schedule some re-training or....................replacement.    JIM"

We stopped at Discovery Point, Watchman Overlook (great views of Wizard Island and the Devil's Backbone), Merriam Overlook (close up views of Devil's Backbone), Palisade Point and Skell Head Overlook. All of these were amazing. Unfortunately, when we visited in early July, the Rim Drive between Skell Head and Sun Notch was not yet open, so we missed a few places.

It looks just like other gorgeous lakes ive seen in canada and other crater lakes in philippines and not spectacular enough to justify 13hr drive (at least for me)- but winter photos really drew me in. Unfortunately our first day there, weather prediction said snow showers (we're from san diego and clueless) which meant zero visibility (as u cn see from some photos..) and the wind was strong and painful. On our first day there, we literally had to fight the wind to move forward and not fall down on the thick snow. and when there was partly sunny weather next morning, my travel partner once again took a long time getting ready and we missed the sunrise by the crater which was really the main goal. So even though our trip was an epic fail, i did have a fun time snowshoeing (our first time, rented the shoes frm the rim cafe and easy to put on) and the views with 100% visibility was incredibly beautitul as all the white contrasted with the lake's deep blue color. There is hardly anyone there during winter so you can enjoy the quiet and solitude and entrance fee is only 15$ but free for active military. You would have to carry snow chains, and some cars may need it but we had driven my bf's FJ cruiser so his wheels were adequate and we didnt have problems on the main road as it is well paved. Aside from snowshoeing, we made snow angels, watched a few skiers slide to their parking spots (wishing terribly we cn ski too lol) and just took tons of photos. "

White sand beaches with turquoise waters, and best of all, no one is there! We originally went to see Lobo Canyon, but the timing for the day trip is not long enough (it is nine miles round trip). We had to pivot, and instead walked along a ~2 mile beach strip, which was entrancing. The island is truly special.

The walk out to Terry Pines is on a road, except for a short bridge over a pond where the road got washed out years ago. Not much elevation gain to get to the base of the trees. Then a trail breaks off and climbs through the trees to the top of the hill and then back down on the other end. Fairly steep at the beginning and the end but level along the top. There is an option at the top to hop over to the Torrey Pines road for a slightly longer, less drastic descent. If you opt for the steeper trail descent, there is a park bench about half way down. Great ocean views from the top and coming back down. We hiked the tree loop clockwise. If the conditions are good, the boat will stop at Painted Cave on the return trip. Amazing cave!

Water Canyon campground lovely and they have terrific amenities such as flushing toilets and clean, large bathrooms! The showers were unavailable until the drought is over :( but the flushing toilets did just the trick. Be prepared for windy weather. Bring extra pegs and ties for your tent. The windbreaks around the tent were very useful.... Would recommend the Los Lobos Canyon walk with the naturalist from the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary. Dianne was awesome and very knowledgeable.

Also the foxes are everywhere and they will collect or chew on unattended things. Second, cell phones do not work on the island and there are very few rangers, so you must use caution. It is very remote and help is hours away, really follow warnings. The island is very rugged with many loose cliffs and canyons and few finished trails, but that all being said, it is worth it.

It is a fun boat ride out, via Island Packers Cruises.  Once you get there you'll be let off the boat onto a pier where you'll see the sandy coastline.  Once off the pier and on the land, you'll see what once was a ranch with old wooden fences and buildings.  In the distance you'll see rolling hills and during the summer months, flowing waves of golden grassy areas.  There are many trails to walk, of different difficulties, so there's something for everyone!  I chose to hike to the Torrey Pines.  This island is one of only two places on earth that they exist! The walk was beautiful.  I passed the campgrounds (yes, you can even camp on these islands) and a few grassy areas along the way.  Once there, the trees were almost majestic.  I took my time walking back and took a trail down to the beautiful white sandy beach for the lunch in my backpack.  The blue, clear water was breaking softly against the sand.  I was in paradise. I headed back to the pier to catch the boat, and on the way back, we saw some humpback whales; a mother and her calf.  The mother was spouting and then diving down, showing off her magnificent tail, while the baby stayed near the surface and breached over and over!  Then we moved on and made a stop at the Painted Cave (on the edge of Santa Cruz Island).  It's one of the largest sea caves in the world.  The captain brought the huge boat into the cave so that everyone could get a close look at the many colors that mother nature had put in this cave.  Once we left the cave, we came across some playful dolphins and they raced the boat for a bit!  Then we headed back to the mainland.  It was a wonderful day and I can't wait to do it again!"

I did not expect Anacapa to be so big, as we saw on the map in the brochure that it is quite small compared to most of the other islands out here. We especially enjoyed seeing the famous arch (as well as a couple of other less magnificent arches), the sea lions on the far side of the island, the kelp forests, the lighthouse, and the generally barren landscapes.

It was windy and overcast on the day of our visit but we managed to see almost everything the island had to offer, everything that can be observed on a single day that is. We visited during nesting season, so the island was overrun by freshly hatched chicks and their territorial mothers but we managed to enjoy ourselves. We were struck by the abundance of endemic plant and animal species, several dozen of which we had the pleasure of observing. Park staff and volunteers were extremely kind and able to answer some of our questions about the island and its inhabitants. If we had the opportunity to return we would gladly do so. However, we would take a few field guides with us and try going at a different time of year, preferably when more of the plants are in bloom. We were struck also by how vibrant the water was, our photography skills proved inadequate to capture the colors of the water at the boat dock, it was gorgeous though. If, like us, you don't have the luxury of being able to decide what time year you visit, just go. You'll be glad you did.

Incredible views of marine mammals (binoculars a must), hawks, vultures and sea birds, plenty of benches and well defined trails.  we snorkeled in the boat landing cove and saw some interesting marine life in relatively warm waters.  the ride out and back were also time well spent.

Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),Anacapa Island,National Parks,4.5,Camping at Anacapa (Seagull) Island,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had 2 nights reserved for camping at Anacapa to spend the July 4th holiday weekend - however, the trip was so terrible we actually came home one day early.  Where to start... first off, I can't believe that people who have reviewed Anacapa don't speak to the amount of birds there are on this island.  The seagulls lurched around our campsite 24/7 aggressively trying to steal any food they could get their beaks on, while constantly squawking and pooping.  If you are looking for a peaceful place to stay, avoid Anacapa at all costs.  The seagulls never stopped squawking, even throughout the night.  Unfortunately there was pretty bad wind and our tent suffered some damage -  the zipper door wouldn't shut the whole way.  So, between the foghorn that sounds every 10 seconds (literally, I counted), the seagulls screaming bloody murder and trying to sneak into our tent, we had pretty much the worst night ever.  I just scrolled through the slideshow pictures of Anacapa from Island Packers' website - wow, false advertisement!  Someone must have photo-shopped all of the seagulls out!  Sorry but we're not talking beautiful, exotic rare birds here... these are gross, ridiculously loud seagulls for crying out loud!  This place was like the set of an Alfred Hitchcock movie - what a nightmare!  The stench on the island is unreal - the seagulls have an endless supply of fresh poop locked and loaded and are ready to release a sh-- storm on you at any given moment.  With no running water available on the island, you can see the dilemma!   The wind was pretty unreal - 20 knots - meaning your tent will need to be tied down in numerous places and the island turns into a dust bowl.  So basically, I recommend this place if you are deaf, have an impaired sense of smell, and a burning desire to experience a day in the life of a seagull.  "

Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),The Sea Caves,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Adventurous Trip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My friend and I booked the Sea Cave kayaking tour through Santa Barbara Adventures. I was expecting a relaxing kayak trip through caves, but the kayaking was very strenuous and at times technical. The ocean was rough and we kayaked through waves and ""foam tornadoes"". We were in a group of 15 kayaker with 3 guides. Most people were in double kayaks and a few in singles. My friend and I were in singles and were the only girls in singles (might have been easier if we were in a double). My friend was not able to navigate around one portion of the rocks and one of the guides towed her in by attaching her kayak to hers. That being said, Santa Barbara Adventures did an excellent job on the tour. They were very easy to find when we arrived at the dock for check in, one guide was waiting there to check in arriving group members. He explained what would be happening and gave us our boarding passes for the boat to the island. Both guides were VERY thorough with their instructions and made sure everyone knew what to do on the trip. When we got out on the water they had us practice maneuvers before we headed out. Both guides were very attentive to the group and although I thought the trip was a little scary and more adventure than I had anticipated, I had the utmost confidence in our guides and felt safe with them leading our group. One couple capsized in their kayak, but were able to get It turned over and get back in and the woman credited the expertise of the guides and their instruction the reason they were able to do it so efficiently. I would highly recommend Santa Barbara Adventure Company!"

Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),The Sea Caves,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Fun sport adventure!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The sea caves of Santa Cruz island are really cool to see. We saw them by kayak. We arranged a guided kayak trip with Aquasports. We kayaked the sea caves for two days. Kayak is the only way to see the caves. My only cautions about the sea caves are to know what you are signing up for. WHen I was booking the trip, my impression was I would be on a sightseeing trip that included guided kayaking and self-guided hiking. The kayaking, however, is approached more as a sporting adventure by our Aquasports guide. It is sporting as in the people who like to do this enjoy challenging their kayak skills by getting into tight spaces, making quick turns, and navigating obstacles for the fun of it. These are things you do not need to do just for sightseeing, but are done for the joy of kayaking. This was a small but noticeable difference between my expectation and reality. Also relevant to the point is that the kayaking was extensive and fatiguing for two ladies who are not so fit in this regard. To have the best time, know what you are signing up for, and be ready to work hard. The caves are fabulous, and an experience not readily had elsewhere. Sea conditions are extremely variable, as is the wind, and we totally lucked out with quite calm weather. Highly recommended, but stay flexible."

We explored caves, watched birds and encountered seals and dolphins. A few people also took the opportunity to snorkel. A great family fun. Captain Garrett and guide Johnny were awesome. We'd definitely recommend the tour with Blue Ocean Kayaking."

Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),The Sea Caves,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Not a Very Long Cave,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Let me start by stating that my expectations of what a ""sea cave"" actually is was a little off.  You paddle through openings in the rock formations and paddle out the other side.  They are not long dark caves that you spend longer then a couple of minutes going through.  I would recommend checking out the Painted Caves as an alternative.  That tour was only offered on weekends and wasn't an option for us.  It is a bit expensive for a family but it is ""a once in a lifetime experience"" so I would still recommend it. "
Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),The Sea Caves,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Incredibly fun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did a sea kayak tour on Santa Cruz island. We got the boat from Ventura. It's quite easy to find and plenty of parking. Arrive a little early so that you can complete forms. There are other kayak tours and campers and day hikers leaving from this spot so you have to find the right check in person. But that is no problem at all.
Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),Santa Cruz Island,Islands,4.5,Beautiful Island and Whales!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a great day on Santa Cruz Island.  We hiked to multiple overlooks with amazing views.  We also hiked into the canyon.  We were disappointed because we hadn't seen any foxes after hiking so much and on our way back to the boat we encountered two around the camping ground!  And despite all that, the best part of the whole trip was the ride over.  We were surrounded by common dolphin at one point.  But the most amazing thing was these two humpback whales we saw.  They put on a show for us!  They breached multiple times and even went on this long session of sticking their tails way out of the water and slapping them.  So cool!"
Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),Santa Cruz Island,Islands,4.5,Secluded National Park visited by 75 minute ferry.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the day trip cruise($116 for 2 seniors) from Ventura Harbor to Scorpion Cove, departing at 9AM and returning at 5PM. Arriving at 10:15AM, a volunteer gave a 10 minute briefing before we began the ~2 mile Cavern Point Loop. The moderate difficulty dirt/gravel trail began near a campground where we spotted 2 Island Foxes and featured nice coastal vistas of island cliffs from its final height. The Visitor Center and accompanying signboards gave the islands history to include ranching and farming with much of their rusted equipment in view.  We found a shaded picnic bench for our packed lunch, joined by a couple huge crows and several Scrub Jays. Many of the younger visitors enjoyed kayaking, snorkeling or swimming. Wonderful visit in good weather"
Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),Santa Cruz Island,Islands,4.5,Day trip to wild paradise island ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Took the Island Packers boat trip from Ventura to Scorpion Harbor on Santa Cruz Island. 1 hour each way. Saw at least 100 common dolphins on the boat ride. Then did a hike from Scorpion to Potato Harbor, a moderate trail along the cliff. Though only 5 miles round trip, we took 2.5 hrs to enjoy the absolutely breathtaking scenery the whole way. The island looks like Jurassic Park. We spotted even more dolphins and a grey whale off the coast. The island foxes run around like squirrels. There is no civilization except an old abandoned ranch. Pit toilets are reasonably clean, no running water, not even trash cans. "
Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),Santa Cruz Island,Islands,4.5,Hike Cavern Point Loop Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"After our kayak tour and lunch, we hiked the Cavern Point Loop trail (about 2 miles). A little bit of elevation gain and you get great views of Scorpion Anchorage and some of the coast. The pit toilets we encountered were in reasonably good shape. There's no food concession, so bring your own food and drinks. No trash cans, so be prepared to take out anything you bring in. The foxes may be ""cute,"" but don't feed them."
Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),Santa Cruz Island,Islands,4.5,Beautiful! But pack a lunch etc.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nature reserve, not a tourist trap. You won’t find gift shops or restaurants here. You will be expected to bring your own food and pack out all of your trash. That is what keeps this place magical. We docked at Scorpion Ranch, which used to be a sheep farm. "
Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),Santa Cruz Island,Islands,4.5,Beautiful cliffside scenery and varied terrain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent an enjoyable day hiking on Santa Cruz Island. We took the 9:00am and the 4:30 pm Island Packers shuttles. That allowed us plenty of time to do the 8 mile Potato Harbor/Scorpion Canyon/Smugglers Road loop....including a 30 minute lunch stop, a short restroom/water refill/rest at a picnic table at the campground, several photo stops, and time to visit the NPS exhibits. We did this trail counterclockwise, so we were along the cliffs initially, ate our lunch at Potato Harbor enjoying the view and listening to the sea lions, then refilled water at campground with a rest under the shade trees there, but that meant we were on the uphill and exposed inland part during the hottest part of the day. There are a few of the former sheep ranch buildings and equipment to see, including the park service exhibits near the pier. Toilets are pit toilets, but were clean and well stocked with toilet paper and hand sanitizer and are located near the Pier and also at the campground. There are also some changing rooms near the Pier. Be aware that there are no trash cans....pack out what you pack in. We disappointingly did not see any island foxes, but there were lots of little lizards, crows, butterflies, and other birds. We loved the cliff side scenery of the Cavern Point and Potato Harbor. The campground is in a valley and does have the only real shade trees. Most of the trails are fully exposed to sun. Unfortunately, there are also yellow jackets around the water spigots....also available at the Pier and "

We used Island Packers to spend the day here and had the best time. Seeing the adorable little foxes, climbing trails to the top of the island, and experiencing the endemic plants and wildlife on this island made the Channel Islands feel like it was worlds away from the mainland. A great place to take the kids for the day or spend some time as a couple. The ferry over was very cold but as the day went on it heated up on the island. Definitely dress in layers if you come in winter. Would love to see the other Channel Islands in the future."
Channel Islands National Park,California (CA),Santa Cruz Island,Islands,4.5,Two-Night Overnight,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A 48 hour adventure for somebody who hikes a lot and loves National Parks, but doesn’t camp a lot. Can’t say it changed my mind about camping as it was extremely uncomfortable...but Channel Islands was still an experience I’ll never forget and I’m glad it was more than a day trip. Hiked Smugglers Cove the first afternoon. Did the kayak tour on day 2 — a huge highlight — followed by snorkeling. Hiked to Potato Harbor and Scorpion Canyon the third day. Highly recommended. (Btw, rented the camping gear and shipped it all back upon returning to mainland.)"
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Waterpocket Fold,Geologic Formations,4.5,Colorful Geological Wonder,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Waterpocket Fold is the 100 mile (162 k) long geological feature known as a monocline that is protected by Capitol Reef National Park and is the feature that led to the “Reef” part of the park’s name as it proved to be a formidable barrier to transportation like a reef at sea (the “Capitol” part of the name is derived from the sandstone domes that look like a capitol building’s dome).  This huge buckle or fold in the earth’s surface was created when a fault underlying the layers of sandstone above uplifted the western side.  Subsequent erosion has lead to the exposure of the many colorful layers of sandstone as well as producing magnificent rock formations including eroded pockets that hold water in the desert environment year round giving the “fold” its name. Excellent views of the Waterpocket Fold can be seen from the park’s scenic drive, Sunset Point overlook, Notom-Bullfrog Road, Strike Valley overlook and Larb Hallow overlook on scenic UT 12."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Waterpocket Fold,Geologic Formations,4.5,The Reason for This National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have reviewed many of the attractions in this park separately. The Waterpocket Fold is an element in most of them. This is the one big thing that makes this park worthy of national park status. Everything else is rock formations not so very different from those found in Utah's other national parks. The fold is unique, and in my opinion unmissable. Find some way to see it. I recommend Notom Road for the best view from within, and the Strike Valley Overlook hike for the best overview."

We're from Portland, OR. We flew into SLC and saw Arches, Canyonlands, Monument Valley, Natural Bridges. And Capitol Reef. We loved this trip! Every Park was amazing and breathtakingly beautiful in it's own way. Capitol Reef was so special because of it's geological formation. We went to the geological talk given by the Park Ranger at 10:00am @ the Visitoor Center. We learned so much about the incredible story behind it's creation...We stayed an extra day just to explore Capitol Reef more...we drove the scenic drive 3 times and hiked the Grand Wash  and the Hocken Bridge Trail...I could've stayed a week longer...I loved all the Parks we saw....Capitol Reef was my favorite...."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Waterpocket Fold,Geologic Formations,4.5,Spectacular drive with hikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This drive down on Notom-Bullfrog road to the rather otherworldly Waterpocket Fold is amazing. The road is dirt but very solid- would be good for car when dry. Get out along the way to see the ancient oyster reefs from when this area was at the bottom of a sea. South of the intersection with the Burr Trail road are some excellent canyon hikes including some wonderful slot canyons.  We used a hiking guide book by Rick Stinchfield which covers the park in great detail.  When leaving the fold, go via the Burr Trail road to Boulder for new and different views. When you rise up out of the fold stop and look back at an utterly amazing view.  When you loop back up to Torrey, you will be passing through some of Escalante and going over Boulder Mountain which offers spectacular views back over the territory you've covered. The whole thing complete with hiking 2 canyons was a great way to spend the day."

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Waterpocket Fold,Geologic Formations,4.5,Little Grand Canyon?,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We visited Capital Reef during a 7 NP swing in 9 days.  Our first stop from Denver was Capital Reef and we saw the Waterpocket fold in the first 30 minutes.  First we stopped at the visitor's center and received a really good itinerary from the Ranger working the desk.  It is a short walk from the parking lot to the Waterpocket fold.  You are treated with expansive views of the canyon below.  This was amazing.  It was only dwarfed when we saw the Grand Canyon a few days later.

Just one of the views one should take the time to do when at Capitol Reef. Make the loop drive through the Park, east on the Burr Trail, and north back to the highway on the Notom-Bullfrog Road; then back to the Park or wherever you are going. Interesting drive also if you head towards Hanksville, at least 1/2 way there. Or go visit Goblin State Park while in the area. (Extremely unique)."

Lots of hiking to do, with many options of easy to hard.  I hiked Hickman's Arch and Cassidy Arch as well as some roaming around Grand Wash and other easy areas.  This park is beautiful, and amazing and no one has heard of it in the Midwest.  I drove the Burr Trail Road to the Waterpocket Fold.  about 30 miles, and worth it.  It is paved most of the way, until the last couple of miles.  The drive to the Eastern side of the fold was worth it! and a bit scary to go down the 1000' to get there."

There is a parking area and then a boardwalk to view the petroglyphs on the rock mountain. The petroglyphs are not close to the boardwalk and that was wise of the National Park, so people don't damage.  If you have binoculars you can view many more of them vs with just your eyes.  There is a ranger talk in the morning and the ranger did have wonderful strong binoculars to use.  There is also a wooden boardwalk to view other petroglyphs and you should walk both areas.  "

You really have to be eagle-eyed and pay attention, or put some research into where to look on the rocks to truly see all the various petroglyphs.  We were fortunate to be walking on the boardwalk very near a group of women who were exceptional at spotting them, otherwise we would have missed quite a few.  This is an easy walk along the boardwalk."

These not quite as easy to spot (fixed binocular type devices are there to help you see them - or maybe take your own). Both areas area very accessible."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Fremont Petroglyphs,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,"In my opinion, a MUST see!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very easy trail to follow. there is a walkway that is paved for people with disabilities or strollers. plenty of petroglyphs to see! but you can go off the paved path and hike up the trail. I did not find that hike worth the effort though..perhaps I missed the artwork.(?) I was alone and didn't really know what i was looking for up there.  I definitely recommend walking across the road to see the 'cave' with cave drawings! it is fenced off to protect it from vandals, but I thought the prehistoric drawings were worth the walk. It takes about 15 min? from the museum building. Plus you could see beaver dams and stumps chewed off by beaver teeth. There is a wonderful story about a mother who's child died and a red and black blanket was painted on the sheer wall so that her baby could have it in the afterlife. fascinating! you can see it by looking through a tube that is pointed up the wall (to show  you where it is exactly). I found that trip very worth my time. I would gladly go back. very young children would probably not enjoy the walking. pre-teens and teens who are interested at all in native American history would likely find this very worth their time."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Capitol Reef National Park Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Don't overlook in southern Utah choices,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unlike some other national parks in southern Utah, Capitol Reef does not require timed reservations to enter the park.  That doesn't mean it isn't busy, as a smaller park in terms of infrastructure it is easily crowded with visitors so plan on visiting away from tourist or holiday seasons, or early in the day.  Look at the map and given the one highway through the park it is easy to plan a west-east, or vice versa, tour of highlights.  The park does suffer from a drawback of lacking places to stay or eat in the area, so that places even more of a premium on planning your visit carefully.  The visitor center is always a good start, then Hickman Bridge and The Grand Wash, Sunset Trail and Panorama Point.  The area near the visitor center has many nice picnic spots, so pack a meal and lengthen your day.  I have never been able to visit during fruit season, but a unique feature of the park is the orchards where visitors are allowed to pick.  Can't imagine how lucky you must be to experience that with the crowds attendant in our parks, but if you're inclined it would be a different experience."

There is a 9 mile unpaved road that takes you through a wide slot canyon.   Just happened to read about it in the 'old school' guidebook I still always travel with!  One of our favorite experiences while doing the Mighty Five.  About 1 hour/30 minutes total time and well worth it.

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Capitol Reef National Park Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,The worth the effort to visit!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Capitol Reef is definitely off the beaten path but is very worth the effort to see.  The geology of the valley is unmatched anywhere else. This is the only National Park I am aware of in the West that you can drive right to the Visitor Center without having to pay an entrance fee. The Visitors Center location is perfectly set among towering chimneys of sandstone.  The staff at the visitors center is very professional and friendly and were ready to answer endless questions about what to do in the park. The Visitor Center is smaller than most for a park this size but they seem to have adequate staff and have a full schedule of family friendly programs.  The gift shop area is small but has a good variety of souvenirs. Keep in mind this area is very remote and there is no cellphone or wifi services available.

The hike is nice and easy, and the scenery is beautiful, but I thought this was the least remarkable hike we did in Capitol Reef.

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Grand Wash Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Good Family Friendly Hike, Narrows Are Highlight",4.0 of 5 bubbles,The hike is very family friendly and is shaded in portions. The Narrows section is by far the most interesting part of the hike. We did the entire 2.2 mi. both directions. I would say the western half of the trail through the wash and the Narrows (right in the middle) are the most scenic sections if you only have time to do part of the hike. Almost completely flat.

Just follow the navigable gravel road to the end.  It runs to the SR-24 trailhead.  It’s an easy hike by transversing the wash bed.  The total hike between  trailheads is over 2+ miles, but you can reach the Narrows in 1.3 miles.   The drop is only 200 feet elevation total.  A must hike even for the beginner.   Plus you see everything geologically what a slot canyon is.  The trailhead does split to the Cassidy Arch Trail shortly in.  That hike is not long and elevates back to the left.  BTW a Peregrine falcon swooped down into one of my photos, albeit for a split second."

Unfortunately we have visited Zion National Park several times and had that in mind.  That is not what you will find on this trail.  Instead the trail does indeed narrow but you never get the closed in, canyon like feeling of The Narrows in Zion.  We walked the trail and never knew we had experienced what this park calls The Narrows.  Substantial portions of the trail are loose gravel which makes the walking more tiring.  If you are hiking with a family there are spots where you can adventure a bit up rocks and into side slots."

Elevation change over the length of the hike is a mere 200 feet so the trail seems flat and level. This hike is doable for people of all ages with a minimum of exertion required.

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Grand Wash Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Pleasant Drive. Hike is short.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Grand Wash Trail is a flat canyon hike.  It is described as up to 4.5 miles by some, but it can actually be much shorter...  It is technically a through-hike, with entrance/exit at Hwy 24 and also off Grand Wash Drive, which is off the main Scenic Drive inside Capitol Reef National Park.   There are no good parking spots off Hwy 24 entrance to the hike, so the smart thing to do is to drive to the end of Grand Wash Drive dirt road (off Scenic Drive) and hike to the middle (between 1 to 1.5 miles) where the canyon narrows, then turn back.   The dirt road is bumpy, but passable by most cars.  The trail is flat and good for the entire family. "
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Grand Wash Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Beauty, solitude, silence and wildlife",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This hike takes about two hours round-trip and is well worth the effort.  Hiked this trail at 4 pm and saw absolutely no one. The canyon walls are majestic and magnificent.......from far away and close up the rock walls are amazing......completely smooth and vertical......colors and patterns that defy imagination......the best part was seeing a rare herd of bighorn sheep up close.  If you have time for only one hike at Capitol Reef this is the one to choose.
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Grand Wash Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Like a large scale slot canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very high walls and it narrows down to about 15 feet in places.  Very enjoyable hike.  I would park at the end  closest to the highway (24) and walk up.  That way when you get tired and turn around it will be an easy downhill stroll.  It seems like the narrows are closer to the 24 end too.  Parking at the other end is down a long dirt road and gets scarce.  Also you have to pay the National Park fee.  Didn't see anything about paying at the 24 end.

Combine it with Panorama Point or the Sunset Point Trail for more sights and photo ops.  We spent two days in Capitol Reef, so Goosenecks and Panorama Point were rather anticlimactic."

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Goosenecks Overlook,Hiking Trails,4.5,"A Little Tricky to Get Here, Worth it for the Views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Based upon a recommendation from a co-worker, we did a little research on this area when visiting Capitol Reef NP during our Summer Road Trip.  We have two kids and so we set out to complete the junior ranger activities before heading out to this view point.  There are signs from the main road for Goosenecks Overlook but soon you will run out of pavement on the smaller road and you will need to take the left turn and follow the dirt/gravel road for about a mile before you reach the parking area.  We drove a minivan with very low clearance which handled the gravel road okay, just take it slow and easy.  From the parking area, there is a poorly marked trail which will take you to the overlook.  My recommendation is to follow the worn path and if in doubt, stick to the left and follow the canyon rim.  After a couple hundred feed you will reach Goosenecks Overlook and will be rewarded with a very spectacular view.  Be sure to bring a tripod with you so that you can get a group picture or be prepared to take a selfie.  There were no other hikers there when we visited and so it might be difficult to get someone else from another party to take your picture for you."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Goosenecks Overlook,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Beautiful View, Not a Hike",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The turnoff to the Capitol Reef Goosenecks Overlook is on the south side of Highway 24 just east of Chimney Rock.  After a paved turn-off, it becomes a dirt/gravel road, but doesn't normally require a high-clearance vehicle.  Since the overlook is only a few hundred feet from the parking area, I wouldn't really call it a hike, even though the trail is rough in spots (and definitely not wheelchair accessible).  But the view is indeed beautiful--not anywhere near as spectacular as that at Goosenecks State Park, down by Mexican Hat, but still amazing and well worth the 30 minutes or so it takes to drive in, climb up to the overlook, take pictures and drive out--and even better if you sit for a while to soak it in.  If you have the time, there is an actual hiking trail to the east of the parking area that meanders through the pinyons and rocks to other overlook spots and through beautiful country."

We sat at the top for a while and enjoyed the lunches we packed.  From the top, you are actually looking down at the arch.  We didn't love the direct road to the trailhead, but it was mercifully short.  The only downside for us was that people in Utah, unlike Colorado, don't wear masks of the trail.  The trail is very narrow, nowhere near 6 feet, so we kept having to step off the trail, since people coming toward us would not.  We did this on a Sunday and finally gave up 1/3 of the way up because the other people in large groups with no masks were so annoying, but we went back on Wednesday when it was less crowded and really enjoyed it."

We were able to beat the crowds by starting hiking at 7am on a Sunday. The hike is only difficult for about 1/3 mi. when it leaves Grand Wash up the ledge above. The spur trail to the arch is a bit difficult to follow once you leave the Frying Pan trail. The arch is nice, but not quite as spectacular as other arches and bridges in Southern UT, IMO."

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Cassidy Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,A little bit of everything hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The first part of this hike is down a dry wash until you see the Cassidy Arch Trailhead sign on the left. From there you follow steep back and forth switchbacks up the side of this canyon. Once it levels out, you follow the trail in and out alongside the canyons getting in some great views. There are a few areas where the trail is narrow and there isn’t much room from the edge. Once you get to another sign, make sure you go off to the left to go to the arch. It doesn’t look like a trail because of the rocks but if you go straight ahead, you’ll be on the Frying Pan Trail. The last part is scrambling on the slick rock, following the cairns to the arch which you don’t always see so it seems like everyone takes a different route. Once you get there, you are actually looking down at the arch. People are nice enough to let everyone take their turn standing on top of the arch for pictures. Lots of room to sit and enjoy a snack or lunch before heading back down. It took us about 3 hours to do the hike and that was with stopping to rest every so often. Coming down is worse than going up because of the loose rock and sand on the trail so watch your step. Get here early in the day before it gets too hot and the parking lot gets too full and bring plenty of water."

There were a couple of cars in the parking lot, but we only saw 1 person on the hike up, and just a couple more on the way down.  Our AllTrails app has the hike at 3.1 miles, an out and back.  This hike was a workout for us, but it was so much fun.  The trail was dry, snowy, icy, and muddy at times.  We did not use traction devices, but we do hike with trekking poles.  It was a beautiful afternoon.  Ththis really was a lovely hike too.  Cassidy Arch, at our turnaround point, was very cool.  Well worth the time and effort.

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Cassidy Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,"Tough hike, but worth it!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail was rated moderate on the All Trails site. It was rated difficult on the Capitol Reef map. I would say difficult is more accurate just due to the uphill sections. I am not in shape and it really took a toll on me. A mixture of  elevation (that I’m not used to), heat and my own physical shape made this 3 mile hike take over 3 hours. We did spend some time at the arch taking pictures and resting. But I’m so glad I did it. Everyone we met on the trail said keep going, it’s worth it! Drink plenty of water and rest often and you will make it. Avoid the midday sun! There’s not much shade."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Sunset Point Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Spectacular Views With Little Effort,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail leaves the same parking lot as the Goosenecks Overlook hike. I don't really understand why this doesn't get nearly the foot traffic. It is 1/3 mi. each way to Sunset Point, which is picture perfect postcard ready for those who reach it. It is very level and most able-bodied people should be able to make it to the end. Probably the best hike in the park for those who can't walk very far. Spectacular at sunset."

During the day it offers a view of the west ridges and cliffs, which take on a very subtle shift in colors as the sun sets.  We were fortunate to visit during a full moon, which rose over the vista and competed the picture.  The trail is level and well marked.  There are also benches and lots of flat rocks along the way to avoid the view.  Note:  Be careful, you have to take the gravel road left of  Panorama Point to get to the trailhead."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Sunset Point Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Short Trail to a Nice Overlook of the Waterpocket Fold,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Sunset Point trail trailhead is accessed from a parking area at the end of a good 1 mile (1.6 k) dirt road from the Panorama Point parking area off of Hwy 24 and is easily passable by 2 wheel drive passenger vehicles in dry weather.  The trail itself is flat, short at 0.3 mile (0.5 k) each way, but not well marked on the relatively barren red slickrock.  At the end of the trail one is treated to an excellent view of the colorful Waterpocket Fold as well as several other landmarks of Capitol Reef.  As the Waterpocket Fold stretches from north to south and the viewpoint is to the west, the best viewing and photography is late in the day; I would not bother visiting the viewpoint in the morning as the view is backlight and poor versus the evening lighting.  The Goosenecks, a very contorted deep gorge that has been cut by the Sulfur Creek, is worth taking a look when exploring the Sunset Point trail and its trailhead shares the same parking area.  (Note that the official image shown on TripAdvisor and the other images uploaded by “a Facebook Member, Mar 2010” are actually images from the Navajo Loop trail that starts a Sunset Point in Bryce Canyon National Park.)"
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Sunset Point Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Short Walk For Sunset View,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The sunset view in this case is away from the sun as it sets on the red cliffs of Capitol Reef. A short 1/3 mile walk leads you to a series of high points offering magnificent views of the sandstone cliffs, and even a couple of benches to sit on along the way! Just as the sun sets the cliffs light up bright red for a few minutes and the various features in front of the cliffs cast deep shadows. If there are clouds and the sunset doesn't cooperate be sure to turn around and explore the ripple rock on the path back, there are many small holes and overhangs that sometimes light up beautifully even when the cliffs don't show off. You can follow the canyon edge back to the Goosenecks Overlook if you are adventurous."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Sunset Point Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Recommended.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just a short hike - up the hill from the parking area to the viewpoint. Obviously best at sunset. Main attraction is the red rock formations to the east, not the sunset itself. Go there about 15 minutes before sunset and left after sun went down. No clouds so not much of a sunset but the red rocks did turn an impressive shade of red."
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),Sunset Point Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Amazing views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We took this short trail to view the sunset and look at the stars one evening. The ranger told us that it would be the best spot in the park for stargazing and he was right! There was a full moon whenever we went so we could not see as many stars.

Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),The Hickman Bridge Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,A true moderate hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The worst part of this trail is the first half which is switchbacks and uphill over rocks. Once you reach the descent it gets better switching to trail that goes over sand or a moderate climb up slick rock - not as exhausting as the start. It’s well worth the view - take the path to the right toward the arch and go underneath and around counter clockwise. Make sure you look over the cliff after you start the descent after passing under the arch. 
Capitol Reef National Park,Utah (UT),The Hickman Bridge Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Before or after Arches, Canyonlands?",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Your impression of Hickman Bridge may depend on whether you visited after seeing Arches and Canyonlands or after.  You will see many similar formations in those parks, but fortunately we visited Capitol Reef first and it was new to us.  The hike starts out along a stream, then goes up into the rocks.  There are no concerns about height or narrow trail, and at one point you can walk under a roof of rocks if you take the correct fork (which is easily visible from the trail).  You can walk under Hickman Bridge, returning on the other side.  Places to sit, with shade, so you don't have to feel like this is a forced march.  Definitely one of the hikes to consider if you have limited time in the park."

The first major section, running along and sometimes under rocky red cliffs, was delightful, even with a sign warning us to beware of the ""Rockface Hazard.""  There were enough rocks of different sizes,  obviously having tumbled down the facade to the trail, to make us take the sign seriously. So we stepped lively through that part. "

The parking lot was very busy and we were lucky to get a spot. There is street parking in the area as well. This 1.8 mile round trip trail starts off in a very scenic spot with rock walls built along the river. There is an almost immediate elevation gain but after that initial push it gets easier. Depending on the time of day there are some shaded spots and the varied terrain keeps it interesting. It was fun to walk under and around the bridge. We didn’t have time for much but this trail fit into our trip perfectly.

The hike itself was a gorgeous trek up the side of a mountain.  Rocky up and down parts and sandy parts.  This week we have learned that almost anyone can to a moderate hike if you take your time, rest often, wear proper footwear and use hiking sticks if needed.  I had just twisted my knee three days prior on earlier hike and had mild swelling and a moderate limp.  We decided to try the Hickman Bridge Hike and by using two hiking sticks and taking it very slowly we made it to a breathtaking view and vista.  Remember the tortoise and the hare?

Then west on Burr Trail Road, a short hike on The Gulch trail, a late lunch at Burr Trail Grill and returned to Torrey on Rt. 12. It was a slow paced all day trip with lots of stops to photograph and enjoy the rock formations that vary in color from rusty red to white, gray and sage. All gravel roads were in good condition. If you're in the area and enjoy peace and quiet and the beauty of nature,  by all means travel all or part of this route, especially Burr Trail Road and Rt. 12.

It is probably less crowded than other parks but has a spectacular scenic drive with plenty of hiking trail opportunities. We entered from the west around midafternoon on a Friday in October. We were able to take the scenic route without much traffic which allowed for the possibility of pulling off and taking photos as we desired.  While there are some pull offs, there are not as many as we hoped so it was more difficult to safely stop and take photos in some areas. The scenic drive is about 10 miles in length. You can turn around at the end (Grand Wash) and double back to the entrance. The main scenic drive is paved, but a couple additional off-road routes are not. Keep an eye on weather since water can be an issue on those paths. Capitol Reef has a great variation of land formations and also captures some fall colors with its foliage in certain areas.  There is a fruit orchard along the drive in one section of the park (Fruita). with some historical buildings. The drive into the park from Torrey is also quite impressive though it was under construction so be ready for that. Be sure to stop at the Panoramic Point (Goosenecks Overlook) which comes up shortly after the national park sign, The views there are amazing providing ample photo ops. The park did not have a formal entrance, so fees are on the honor system. There is a visitor center with limited parking when crowded."

It’s a gorgeous area with two options for incredible views off steep cliffs of what might well have been an asteroid crater. It’s a moderately strenuous walk, as opposed to the relatively easy Grand View Point Overlook, so the return on investment is perhaps a bit less. But the return itself is still a sizeable one!

Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Horseshoe Canyon,Canyons,5.0,Worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our group of two adults and three teens hiked this in mid March, which was a great time to go, imo. Warm in the sun, cool in the shade, some of the sand a little damp from rain so a bit easier to walk on. I wore waterproof hiking boots and wool socks and was not bothered with sand in my shoes. We checked the Goblin Valley ranger station first for flash flood warnings--always a good idea in this area. It took us about 2 1/2 hours from Green River in our low-clearance minivan. Bumpy, but doable. We took a shovel in case of sand, but didn't need it. The hike itself took about 5 hours with three (squirrel!) ADHD teens. No bugs. Lots of wild horse poop, no horses to be seen. The art is even more AMAZING than I anticipated. Take a picture of the map at the beginning of the trail so you don't miss any, and make sure you go around the rocks to the right of the Horseshoe panel to see some hidden art. While there, you can crawl up now rocks to the right and see some petroglyphs that go on for yards, if you look close."
Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Horseshoe Canyon,Canyons,5.0,Checking out the Panels in Horseshoe Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fun trip to this part of Canyonlands NP!  The dirt road into horseshoe Canyon was no problem - no 4 WD or high clearance vehicle needed.  The volunteer rangers did an outstanding job of explaining the different panels in the canyon.  We camped out by the trailhead and there were plenty of camping sites available.  It was a eight (8) mile round trip (out and back) and the hike out of the canyon wasn't that difficult.  The trail is well marked.
Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Horseshoe Canyon,Canyons,5.0,WHOA!  READ PLEASE.  Things you NEED to know about this hike.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are some older reviews.  Some are VERY MISLEADING.  I am going to give it to you straight.  The road to Horseshoe Canyon is long, rough and could give non 4 wheel drive passenger cars real trouble if not driven properly.  It took us over an hour to drive.  I have a 4 wheel drive pick up truck and am experienced with driving off road.  The hike: First, context is very important for something like this; I am 57.  I am no longer in top physical shape but am a very experienced hiker who used to be an avid rock climber and backpacker.  I have strong experience hiking the canyons of Southern Utah.  If I were 30 and in peak shape this hike would have been much easier but still DIFFICULT, not moderate as others have described.  So be advised.  The hike is 7.5 miles round trip.  No previous review mentioned the sand.  Like some other Utah canyons there is A TON of hiking in loose sand.  I would estimate 60-70% of the hike is like walking on the beach through deep sand.  This makes it a lot more difficult than a normal 7.5 mile hike.  Now, I know conditions can change.  The sand is probably much firmer and easier to hike in winter.  But on Memorial Day week, when we did it, and until at least October/November, it is loose, deep and will slow you down.  You cannot walk around the sand.  It covers the entire floor of the canyon.  Like many southern Utah hikes it is a HOT hike.  We hit the trail at 7:30 AM which made for a nice cool easy descent into the canyon and a very hot strenuous ascent back out in the heat of the day.  There is absolutely no shade on the way in or out of the canyon.  Once you are down on the sandy bed of the canyon floor there is shade provided by the high canyon walls and some Cottonwood trees.  I will not mince words here.  If you do not take a wide brim hat and plenty of water you might not make it.  Heat exhaustion is a real threat regardless of your physical condition.  I would strongly advise you bring sunglasses, sun block and a long sleeve shirt to change into if needed.  We made it to the Great Gallery about 11:00-11:30 which included stops at 2 of the 3 previous galleries.  There were a few small pools of water along the way accompanied by the usual voracious black flies.  We reached the start of the trail climbing back out of the canyon in pretty good time as it is downstream and we began moving a little better through the sand.  The hike out in the heat of the day was tough.  The trail was much harder to follow going up.  The upper portions are entirely over slickrock and you must follow cairns (little piles of stones), or as we used to call them,  ""ducks"" to stay on trail.  This takes some searching and you need to keep your eyes forward along the trail. The cairns are all along the trail even in the bottom of the canyon but are spaced sporadically.  Many have collapsed.  Inexperienced hikers will find the upper trail difficult to follow.  There is an old ranchers water tank near the top that you can see periodically from below and helps ensure you are on the trail.  There is also a dinosaur track ringed in stones right on the trail near the top.  Bottom line is we made it back to our vehicle, hot and weary, at 4:00 PM.  This is a FULL DAY excursion despite the relatively short total hiking distance.  We drank plenty before starting and brought 5, 1 liter Nalgene bottles of water.  We should have brought 6. Hiking poles were invaluable in the sand.  Bring at least one. 2 might be better. We saw exactly one other hiker and one ranger on the trail all day. The other hiker had 2 poles and was moving very well.  She ended up doing the hike about 45 minutes faster than we did.  The ranger was traveling very light and mentioned she was just making sure any hikers were prepared and had enough water.  Again, this is a serious hike not some happy go lucky stroll to see some pictographs.  You can get into real trouble.  Now....the galleries. The first gallery was very easy to spot in the morning sunlight.  It is only about a half an hour along the canyon bottom once you get down and is located on the west side only about 10 feet up.  The pictographs are much smaller than the Great Gallery but very beautiful.  The next gallery is the ""High Gallery"" which we did not see until on the way out, probably due to the angle of the sun.  It is a small gallery across the canyon from the first.  As it's name suggests, it is quite high on the east canyon wall.  The 3rd and smallest gallery is the ""alcove gallery"" located on the west wall in a large alcove about midway from the first gallery to the Great Gallery.  It took a little searching to find.   There are no trail markers for any of these first galleries.  Keep your eyes open and your heads up!  None of the first galleries compare to the Great Gallery.  If you continue to follow the canyon bottom upstream you will eventually reach it.  This one is easy to spot.  Very large and vast with 8 foot tall figures.  There is a makeshift bench to sit on with binoculars in ammo cans for your use.  Very nice touch here by Canyonlands National Park.  We brought our own.  Binoculars are very useful to see the detail of the ancient art.  I will not go on and on about how magnificent this gallery is.  If you are willing to make the strong effort required to get there you will walk away knowing it was very worth it.  You may walk away with more, as we did.  The presence of this sacred place combined with the beauty of the canyon itself left us with a real sense of awe and accomplishment."

Just getting to the trailhead is a bit of an adventure as it is a 30 mile haul along a gravel road.  And the 6-mile round-trip hike is challenging but the views in the canyon are beautiful and the four rock art panels are not to be missed.  Of course, the Great Gallery is the primary draw and is well worth the effort of getting there.  This is a highly recommended hike.  "

Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Horseshoe Canyon,Canyons,5.0,"Spectacular remote hike, come prepared. here's how.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"First of all, getting to Horseshoe Canyon is not bad at all assuming it hasn't rained recently. The road from Hanksville is honestly better than many of the main roads in the Chicagoland area. You can go 40mph most of the way. Leaving from Hanksville, it took me just about an hour to get to the trailhead. About half way in a small Geo Metro was driving toward me and asked for directions back to the highway. Once I saw this car has been out here, I knew I would be fine. The trailhead has an outhouse (fairly clean) and plenty of parking. I think there were maybe 3 other cars when I was there. The hike down is exposed and you are in the sun for a good duration of the hike, I did it in October. They tell you to bring a gallon of water with you which is a good idea. I had 3 liters with me, plus one waiting for me in the car when I got back. Along the way you pass an old water holding tank (empty). Once at the bottom of the canyon the hike is pretty straight forward. There are some other excellent rock art panels before the Great Gallery so do some research before you go or you may end up passing them up. We passed a volunteer ranger on the way who told us we were almost there. I think he stays at the gallery for part of the day. When I arrived at the Great Gallery, no other groups were there. It was peaceful, quiet, powerful moment. Expect the gallery to be in full sun in the morning and shade in the afternoon. At about 2:00/3:00PM, half was in sun the other half shade. You return the way you came. The climb out is about 700 feet so be prepared for the most difficult part of the hike at the end. Since the road was so good from Hanksville, I decided to take the other route north to Green River. This road was nowhere near as well maintained as the other - I wouldn't have done it if I didn't have a 4 wheel drive. It was a very pretty drive as the sun was setting. Took about 2 hours to get to Green River. A day you will never forget."

Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Horseshoe Canyon,Canyons,5.0,A challenging hike with Native American Art rewards,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Horseshoe Canyon is difficult to access, possibly by design to protect the wonderful Native American artwork on the canyon walls. The hike begins after a 32 mile dirt road adventure off of Rte 24 that leaves you a little rattled and glad to be on your own two feet for the next several hours. There is a huge parking area equipped with a pit toilet and a kiosk explaining the canyon and hike. You have a feeling of really being in the middle of nowhere, which you truly are. Don't expect to see too many people on this hike but do expect to be enthralled by the canyon art. The hike is billed as anywhere from 6.5 to 7.8 miles depending on which sign, brochure or hiking book you have. Our GPS (Garmin etrex 20 for reference) recorded the hike as closer to 8 miles but I guess these things don't always work right in the canyons.  The descent into the canyon is gradual and mostly over slick rock although there are some stretches of rather deep sand. When at the bottom of the canyon keep your eyes peeled for the cairns that lead the way through the wash. It wasn't always evident in a couple places along the way where the cairns were pointing but we did make it in and out. you will have the opportunity to view 4 different canyon art areas and each is very nice, some more preserved than others. Try not to miss the large rock cairn at the huge alcove in the canyon wall where there is quite a collection of art figures. We totally missed this on the way in. The real treat is the Great Gallery at the end of the hike. There is some shade for viewing and some conveniently stacked rocks for sitting. There is a bench supplied by the NPS and some binoculars and an ammo can with some notebooks with descriptions and history, etc. We arrived at the Great Gallery and enjoyed our lunch while viewing the artwork. Of course many of the figures look like aliens rather than people. It would be wonderful to know why. The hike out is the challenging part of the hike. The last part is the ascent up the slick rock ""road"" that we came in on. This is definitely a hike not to be missed even though it is difficult to get to and there are absolutely no facilities for miles and miles and miles around. So glad we came."

But the majestic overlooks at Grand View Point and the Green River Overlook may spark the imagination of all who peer down into the depths of this gaping chasm. While mountain bikers, hikers and float trippers wander along the primitive pathways or navigate down the Colorado and Green Rivers, many visitors are content to access the overlooks and admire the spectacular landscapes. The Green River Overlook, from an elevation of 6,000 feet, looks out across Soda Springs Basin towards the Green River. Seeing this viewpoint for the first time may catch visitors from Chicago by surprise, especially if they aren't accustomed to wide open spaces and great heights and near silence. The Green River outlook, like the Grand View Point Outlook, lives up to the term ""breath-taking experience."" From this viewpoint, the Green River is a tiny ribbon of water at the bottom of an awe-inspiring canyon. The vista stretches out for 100 miles to the horizon.

Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),White Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Stunning Scenery - Not for the Faint at Heart,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Before you even consider driving this road, don't make the same mistake I did. Research it. Research it well. This is not a short jaunt through Canyonlands. This is not designed for your 4WD Subaru, small truck or SUV. This is not even designed for a jeep unless you have proper gauge tires designed for off-roading. What this road (and I use that term with great caution) is: a stunning 110 mile loop drive (or bike ride) over steep switchbacks, along the rims of box canyons with 500+ foot sheer drop-offs, over wicked steep, rocky hog backs and through arroyos. You will not exceed 10 mph on this road unless you wish to find yourself in the Colorado River without a raft. You should be prepared to spend at least 9-10 hours if you complete the loop. There are no side roads if you need an escape hatch. It's a commitment."

Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),White Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,White Rim Trail from the saddle of a dirt bike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've done the WRT twice on a dirt bike with a fairly large group of riders.  Both times starting at Mineral Bottom and exiting once at the Shaffer Switchbacks and the other returning to Moab via Potash Rd.  If you don't stop for many pictures (you will want to) be prepared for at least 5 hours of riding at a good pace.  Be aware that motorcycles must be licensed, plated and insured otherwise risk being stopped by the park ranger and issued a summons.  Most of the group were on fairly agile dirt bikes (I ride a KTM 500EXC).  I'm sure that the trail has been successfully navigated on larger ""adventure"" bikes but these would be definitely more challenging in the deep sand along the river near Mineral Bottom.  If you start at Mineral Bottom you will encounter the sand sections while you are still fresh.  If you start at Shaffer these are encountered near the end of the trail when you are most tired.  You pick your poison.  Your skills will determine how difficult these sand sections will be.  There are a couple of interesting climbs mainly Hardscrabble Hill and Murphy's Hogback.  Even though the trail is all two track I suggest keeping to the right lane when climbing these hills.  There are lots of blind corners and you might encounter on-coming traffic at a most inopportune time.  Mountain bikes tend to descent at a high rate of speed and you don't want a collision especially in such a remote area.  A head-on collision with a jeep would be no fun either."
Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),White Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,A 90 mile long rough 4WD  “moderate” rated trail.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a rough 4WD trail with several overlooks of the Colorado River and canyons.  Some of the trail can be seen about 1400 feet below the Grand View Point in Canyon Lands National Park.  The get there you must take Shaffer Switchbacks Trail, which turns off Highway 313 a few miles prior to the Canyon Lands National Park visitor center.  Shaffer Trail is classified as an “easy” trail for a high clearance 4WD vehicle; however, most of it is one lane with few places to pass vehicles.  Therefore you must watch for vehicles coming from opposite direction, so you can determine where to pass.  I did encounter “Big Horn sheep” on the road; however, they had no trouble climbing up or down the steep slopes on either side of the road.  When we reached the White Rim Trail my altimeter was 1400 feet lower.  There are camp grounds along the White Rim trail.  Where the Shaffer Switchback trail meets the White Rim Trail there is an alternate 31 mile route back to Moab called Potash Road.  It does not include the sheer drop-offs that are found on the Shaffer Switchback trail.  It is also wider, so it is easier to pass approaching vehicles, dirt bikes and quads.  I would recommend the purchase of “Guide to Moab, UT Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails,” by Charles A Wells before attempting any trails in the Moab area.  I have found the book to be an excellent reference."

I looked down from Grand View Overlook and the White Rim Overlook and wondered what it would be like to be on the White Rim.  What I saw made me want to experience the White Rim, and after doing a little bit of research, I discovered that traveling on the White Rim required quite a bit of planning, and therefore, I started my planning a year ago.

Every muscle in my body was sore afterwards from clenching my muscles and I literally cried.  All 3 of us were very scared. Then it started raining which made things even scarier.

The scenery is absolutely beautiful. We took it with a FWD Kia SUV, and we had no problem whatsoever. I personally do not think a 4WD is necessary, but high clearance is definitely a must to avoid damaging your vehicle. The switchback is the easiest part of the road as it is in very good condition, the rest of the road is trickier but nothing impassable. Took us 1h45 from Canyonlands back to Moab with a couple of stops for pictures. Definitely recommend it, as long as you are not afraid of heights and your vehicle has a high clearance."

Pretty sure we suffered with acute stress for a few days when trying to go to bed having flashbacks.  We can laugh about it now but I don’t think I would ever do that again."
Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Shafer Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Switchbacks not so scary, but Potash Road no joke",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's way less scary than it's made out to be. Even in the narrowest part, you've got about 2 feet of space to the ledge. The ""fear"" factor is all mental. If you go slow, drive carefully and don't do anything dumb, there's virtually no risk of going over. Scary? Perhaps. Dangerous? No. I was in a 4Runner but could see some long wheelbase vehicles having trouble on the switchbacks. Even at that it's still probably not a big deal. You can see far ahead if someone is coming up then wait by a turn to squeeze through...On the other hand, Potash Road was no joke. The ""challenge"" in this road really starts when you get past the switchbacks. I suppose you can get through in low clearance and 2WD but there's a risk you're going to bottom out. There are a couple of rough sections and maneuvers. Took us about 2.5 hours from the top to get back to Moab."

I would compare it to the same height anxiety you may have on Gemini bridges road when you overlook Moab! This was phenomenal and the best time of year for weather. It reminds me of skydiving... but really really slowly, so it’s crazy feeling! I was nervous, my hubby was not - if you are like me and heights are kinda freaky don’t drive it have someone else drive. This is not for the faint of heart once you start descending you can’t turn back, you would have a heck of a time. We had our Jeep in 4 wheel drive - hubby put the Jeep in  4low so we didn’t ride the breaks! it’s a step road and can get bumpy. Don’t be mistaken this is a crazy road!

Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),The Needles,Canyons,4.5,Natural Beauty without Crowds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Considered by many to be the most beautiful district of Canyonlands National Park with its maze of canyons and colorful banded rock formations of all sorts, including the many closely clustered rock spires known as The Needles for which the district is named for, it is much less visited than the Island in the Sky District as it much less accessible due to its distance from Moab (74mi/119k/1.5hr) or Monticello (49mi/79k/1hr) and its much lower level of development."
Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),The Needles,Canyons,4.5,"Gorgeous Scenic Drive, Interesting Rock Formations",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Canyonlands National Park is divided into separate districts. The Needles district is in the southeast corner of the park, about 75 miles southwest of Moab. The name ""Needles"" refers to the distinctive rock spires of Cedar Mesa sandstone that are found here. There are two paved roads into The Needles (both turn west off US191): the main entrance which is UT211 and Needles Overlook Rd. which is UT133. Needles Overlook Rd. goes 22 miles (one-way) to a viewpoint that overlooks a maze of canyons below. UT211 is a scenic route that goes 33 miles (one-way) to the park entrance, following Indian Creek among towering red rocks buttes. Until recently, BLM has been managing this landscape of rocky canyons and prairie farmland, but in 2017 the Obama Administration designated this area as Bears Ears National Monument. It's an awe-inspiring scenic drive so the miles pass quickly, though we found ourselves wanting to stop for photos frequently. Once you reach the entrance to The Needles section of the park (Admission $25/car or NPS passes accepted), there is a visitor center with an information desk for permits, exhibits, a small gift/book store, and restrooms. We found the rangers there to be extremely friendly and helpful. (Visitor Center is closed for winter from late November to early March.) There is also a camp store just outside the park entrance with food and fuel. The paved scenic drive inside the park is only about 7 miles long between the visitor center and Big Spring Canyon. There are about a dozen hiking trails from .3 mile to over 20 miles. We did the .6 mile trail at Pothole Point, which was easy, interesting and very scenic. At the end of the paved road, there is a parking area for the overlook of Big Spring Canyon and a trail head for the 2.4 mile Slickrock Trail. If the weather has not been too wet, take an unpaved 3.4 mile (one-way) scenic drive through canyons and hoodoos to Elephant Hill at Soda Springs. When we visited in late August the road had been recently graded and we drove it in a low-clearance 2WD passenger car, but I don't recommend it if it has rained recently or is forecast because the road crosses several washes (best to stop at the visitor center to inquire about road conditions). If you are adventurous and experienced and have a 4WD high-clearance vehicle, there are miles of backcountry roads to explore (permit required). There is not much in this area of the park that is accessible to people who use wheelchairs, but I still felt that the scenic drive alone was worth it. We spent 4-5 hours in the morning exploring The Needles district, then visited Island in the Sky district in the afternoon. Needles is more remote and therefore less crowded. The terrain in these two areas is quite different so I recommend trying to visit both. Note that leashed pets are allowed in the parking areas but not on the trails or in the backcountry. When visiting Canyonlands, be prepared for sun exposure (hat, sunglasses, sunscreen) any time of year and bring water and snacks."
Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),The Needles,Canyons,4.5,Great area for interesting hikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This part of Canyonlands National Park is located about 75 miles from Moab, and it takes about 1.5 hours to get here. It takes its name from the area’s distinctive sandstone spires. We enjoyed two trails in this area of the park. Both are about 0.6 mile long and relatively flat. Our favorite was the Cave Spring Trail, which winds around a white sandstone plateau. The first part of the trail involves exploring the shady alcoves under the rock overhangs. Along the way, you pass a few pictographs, a spring, and relics of an old cowboy camp. Then you climb a wooden ladder and explore the exposed rocky area above which is marked with stone cairns. You come back down another wooden ladder at the end. The other Needles area trail we liked was the Pothole Point trail. This easy, cairned path circles around a small mesa and also has good views over the Needles formations and Big Spring Canyon. There are hundreds of “pothole” depressions in the sandstone rock, which fill with water when it rains and house short-lived tiny ecosystems containing fairy shrimp, tadpole shrimp, horsehair worms, snails, spadefoot toads, and other creatures that spring to life when water is added. They last only until the water is gone. Unfortunately, we were here during a dry season. There are a number of other trails in this area, but most require a longer time commitment than we had. Another landmark in this area is the Wooden shoe Arch, which you can you can see from a distance, and which looks kind of like a giant wooden shoe. Also in the Needles area, we saw lots of ravens, and got some great closeup photos of several of the big birds looking for handouts (though we didn’t feed them and didn’t see anyone else feeding them)."

While I know there is so much said about seeing sunrise from Mesa Arch, let me say that seeing it at Dead Horse Point is incredible.  Please see the pictures but even they do not come close to accurately reflecting it.  You simply have to see it.

Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Grand View Point Overlook,Lookouts,5.0,Mother Nature at Her Best,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Such a spectacular viewpoint. Makes you wonder how our ancestors traversed this country a couple hundred years ago.  Decided to take the Rim Walk which was advertised at one mile. Mostly level - large cairns kept you going in the right direction. There were some built in steps but nothing that would hold anyone back. Only the strong sun could do that without sunscreen. Most agreed it felt like more than a one mile one way  and two miles round trip but at the end you saw the side of the canyon you'd been walking along and the other side as well. Nice place to sit and relax and have a snack to energize you for the return trip. Somehow the trip back seemed shorter. It was a nice way to spent the afternoon - Nature created a gem here.

It is at the end of one section of the road within the Islands in the Sky District. A large parking lot leads to a great overlook of  the surrounding area. But there is also a trail that takes you out further into the canyon and provides a great view at the end but all along the way as well. The extra time spent on the trail was definitely worth it.

Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Island in the Sky,National Parks,4.5,"Review in general of the park, not the visitor center",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The wait!  I visited the park early in the morning, in fact before it was technically open so I had no problem.  But each day when I left the line at the ranger booth was incredibly long.  How long?  There were 142 cars lined up on day one of my visit as I left and 91 on the second day.  And given the number of people paying, asking questions, pulling out their passes, etc., it was easily a couple hours wait in those cars. Given that the Island in the Sky area rises above its surroundings you would think that views would be memorable.  But I found that two factors completely eliminated that hope.  First, it was very windy and a park employee told me that the wind was carrying dust from nearby areas and making the view hazy.  Also, having visited many parks I know that air pollution is a problem and I have no doubt that contributed to the obscured views.  So I had very limited viewing.  Lots of good picnic areas in the park.  Visitor center is extremely small, with no exhibits showing any particular creativity.  Also tiny gift shop.  I have reviews about specific features and trails elsewhere on TA."
Canyonlands National Park,Utah (UT),Island in the Sky,National Parks,4.5,Love Canyonlands,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Canyonlands was wonderful. I didnt have high expectations as all the attention is put on Arches but we LOVED Canyonlands.  We arrived at Mesa arch shortly after sunrise and felt the timing was great- the photographers were getting ready to leave and we were able to get great pics of the arch in the morning light.  Next we did the Great Viewpoint hike which was short easy and had great views the whole way.  We next did the upheavel dome hikes - both viewpoints.  The 2nd viewpoint might be more work that reward compared to the 1st viewpoint.  We visited the various viewpoints as well and dont miss the shafer viewpoint.  My favorite hike in the park was Aztec Buttes. Gorgeous views and just a cool hike.  It does require some scrambling but worth the work!   A lot to see even if you dont want to hike a lot.

It was pretty crowded, so be prepared to wait in line to get a picture.  The views here were great, but shortly down the road is Dead Horse State park, which is very similar.

It ended up exceeding expectations. The walk was short, but the views were great. You get right next to a small arch that frames a canyon background. Some people climb the arch, but that is illegal and damages the fragile sandstone layers, so I warn against it. The canyon behind the arch is vast and geologically unique, even if it wasn’t as amazing as other canyon national parks. Nonetheless, this was the highlight of a decent Utah national park."

Once can cross country ski or snowshoe in.  In fact, the trail was so well groomed that people could actually hike in to see Fairyland.  They ask that if you leave more than 1"" deep track of any kind, that you do not use the groomed area.  Most were respectful of that and used just one far side of the trail.  Once you reach the overlook, you can then descend on another amazing trail.  It is best to take your ski or snowshoe pole.  And definitely have on some kind of hiking boot as the mud areas are quite slippery."
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Fairyland Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Wonderland in Fairyland.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I've hiked hundreds of miles of trails all over Utah. I live in Moab and that should tell you something about my walking experience. This is the most beautiful trail I've ever stepped on. Hiked the Rim Trail to Sunrise point where I ran away because of the crowds and dove down into Fairyland Loop from there leaving all people but a few behind. It was breathtaking to say the least. Bring lots of water and take it all in. Not an easy trail. With Tower arch and everything else I clocked almost 9 miles. Loved every single step of it. 
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Fairyland Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,A happy mistake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We meant to take the Queens loop but got on Fairyland trail from sunrise point. We don't regret a step of it. It's hard to gawk and walk at the same time so we took a looonnngg time to get to tower bridge area and then returning but the hoodoos all look so different from various angles, it's hard to walk with purpose. We also spent a lot of time finding shapes in the hoodoos. It's definitely a moderate trail. My 78 yr old husband did this and he's the reason we turned back before tower bridge, when he says it's time to go back, we go. Towards the top he was tired but was glad he did it. After a picnic lunch he was recovered enough to walk the bristlecone trail at rainbow point."
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Fairyland Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,One of our favorite all time hikes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,On the lodge’s recommendation - thank you Donna!  We did this connecting hike from the Rim Trail all 8 miles and 1700 ft elevation change through to  Sunset Point.  One of our top all time hikes that takes you deep into the canyon ( several times!).  The differing hoodoo vantage points and changes in landscapes from the pinion pines at the rim to twisted gray bristlecone trees.  Did in April with Hardly an animal or insect in sight. Bring hiking poles if you’re 65+ like us.
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Fairyland Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best hike in Bryce! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Woo! One of the most beautiful and secluded hikes we’ve been on. There are highs and lows (literally and mentally)! You see everything- hoodoos from the top and bottom, all kinds of different formations, Sandhills, and forest! The change in terrain and landscape was mind blowing! You go down, up a pretty steep incline, back down and 1 more steep incline! It was like 50% easy and 50% hard incline. We went clockwise so, at the trailhead looking out on the canyon we went left which provided lots of shade on the way back and walked the rim on the way back too which was cool because we got to see all that we hiked from above! We left at 4:15p on a Thursday and got back at 7:45p. We hiked the whole trip without seeing anyone (~6mi) until we got to the campsite (the last 45mins)! Must-do hike in Bryce! Hiking boots helpful and lots of water! "
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Fairyland Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Second only to Wall Street in experience, but without any crowds",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have done almost all of the hikes in the Bryce newspaper given to visitors, and this is at the top.  Okay, tied with whatever means you use to access Wall Street, but that is a far more demanding hike and no place to look for solitude.  Fairyland is at the far end of the trail system, out beyond the crowds near the lodge and visitor center.  It is longer in distance, but less physically demanding than many shorter hikes because the elevation changes are gradual.  Wonderful scenery looking into the ampitheater from an angle you don't get from any other trail.  Even the rim walk doesn't do this area justice, while Fairlyland gets you down into the ampitheater so you can walk among the formations and look at, or sometimes up, at them instead of down on them.  Plenty of places to stop and rest.  As long as you're making the trek be sure to take a very short (100 yards?) side trail to Tower Bridge, something you cannot see from any other vantage point or trail in the park.  Note:  the shuttle system will take you to the start/end of the trail, when operating, so you don't have to be concerned about leaving a car or arranging for pickup."
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Fairyland Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Difference but fabulous views than the amphitheater.  Do both if you can,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did the hike from Sunset Point to Tower Bridge and than back again.  We did not do the loop.  It was about 4.6 miles in total and 830 ft ascend.  Of course you are going all down into the canyon to Tower Bridge and then the ascend is mainly all on the way back up.  The view are significantly different than what you will experience at for example Navajo and Queens trail so I'm very glad we did this one also.  The trail was pretty quite.  Some other hikers but all stretchered out along the trail
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Fairyland Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Hot but Gorgeous,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went in July so of course it was going to be hot.  We knew that going in.  We started at Fairlyand Point at the small but almost deserted parking lot and hiked the 8 miles in a counterclockwise direction.  This means the last mile and a half or so were very steep as we came out of the canyon.  We started about 7:15 am and so the heat only got bad right at the end.  Took us about 4 hours.  Gorgeous.  If you have a choice, I think the fall would be a better time."
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Fairyland Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing and varied views on this hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose this hike for the length (8 miles) and for the fact that it is a loop that does not include the main amphitheater area. So glad we did it! The trail (starting at Fairyland Point and heading down from there) takes you into the canyon for beautiful views of hoodoos from below. Then you hike up and over a ridge with more beautiful views from above. Then you go back down to see Tower Bridge and up to Sunset Point. Amazing views all around! And then the last part takes you back to Fairyland Point on the rim trail for even more great views from above. This was one of the best hikes we have taken in a long time! Lots of varied terrain and so many different things to see. But we didn't see a lot of other people, which was another plus for this trail. Highly recommend!"

The loop itself is about five miles, but that's if a helicopter dropped you into the amphitheater so you did not have to hike from an access point.  Regardless, don't rush it.  This is a long hike and sprinkles the sights along the way.  You will talk through forests, long slopes among the rocks, and a wide variety of rock formations.  The trail frequently curves and snakes along so the experience of seeing what is around the next corner or beyond a rock wall is part of the enjoyment.  The trail you choose to access Peekabo will add to the length, but also the enjoyment."

One particular highlight was hiking from Bryce Point down the Hat Shop Trail.  There were many interesting and unique views along the way down into the canyon. However, at the bottom of the canyon you encounter the Peek-A-Boo Loop trail. This trail is a 3 mile loop that is relatively flat. We started to hike the trail, but quickly found that it is littered with large amounts of horse droppings. That made it rather unpleasant for hiking.

But virtually anyplace along the ampitheater rim offers a great view; the views are just different.  From Sunset Point you get a better view of the hoodoos in the main basin.  And I think it's the best place to start hiking down into the canyon, since the two trailheads here (Navajo and Wall Street) are the two steepest and funnest trails down.  Whereas Sunrise Point gives you a more gradual descent (or ascent) and a great view into Queen's Garden. Both Sunrise and Sunset allow you to see the sun come up over the canyon.  I personally think the best sunrise view is from Bryce Point, since from there you can look west and best see the canyon itself as it lights up.  But there isn't a bad view anywhere in the park."

Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Navajo Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,One of the Best Hikes in the Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My son and I hiked the Navajo Trail counterclockwise on our recent visit to Bryce Canyon.  The Navajo Trail begins near Sunset Point.  It is just under 1.5 miles long and it forms a loop that you can hike either clockwise or counterclockwise.  It can also be combined with Queen's Garden or Peekaboo Loop to make a longer much more challenging hike.  The Navajo Trail itself is not very long, but there is a lot of elevation change for the short trail.  The hike has an elevation change of around 500 feet into the canyon and then 500 feet back up.  There are switchbacks going both down and up whichever direction you hike it.  Do be aware that there are a lot of stones on the trail and you should have appropriate footwear so you do turn your ankle or get injured.  The sights on this trail are wonderful.  Thor's hammer rock formation as well as Wall Street are on this trail.  Additionally there are hoodoos all around as you hike the trail. The hike starts with good views down into the canyon and at the bottom it is very near a wash.  It is not all rock either, there are trees and plants on the hike as well.  I highly recommend a hike on Navajo Trail if you are healthy enough for it and you enjoy a good hike."

Both are rated as moderate but make sure you are ready for the switchbacks on either end!  We went clockwise and headed up the right side of Navajo trail to make sure we saw Thor's Hammer and the Twin Bridges.  We rested at the top, ate lunch, then started down the left side of the Navajo trail to experience The Wall, where the hoodoos form a narrow area, again, with switchbacks.  We didn't go all the way to the bottom on this side but were so glad we got to see The Wall.  Loved this trail!  Keep in mind, what goes down, must come up!  We are 63 and 64 and managed all the switchbacks by taking our time."

The trail is very steep, but well maintained with numerous steps.  You will see all manner of hikers and non-hikers huffing and puffing up (you can go down this trail but still have to come back up in elevation, so you might as well try to see Wall Street.  The other half of the loop ""features"" Two Bridges, but you would walk right by it unless you look back over your shoulder and up a crevasse.  A nice feature of the trail is that when you reach the bottom (or as you stand at the bottom coming from the other way, it is shady and you can cool off and rest.  You can also connect to Peekabo or over to Sunrise for a respite from the elevation."

The hike is not itself long but it covers much of the most iconic and glorious scenery in Bryce and connects to other trails like the Queen's Garden Trail.  We did it in winter, when there was a fair amount of snow and ice and some trail areas in Bryce were closed, but it was beautiful and even though we did not have ""proper"" snow or hiking footwear with us, we had  no problems.   It is, as I said, not long or grueling, but is simply a very nice hike or walk through the sites of Bryce.  One gets right into the hoodoos and can see the Two Bridges as well."

It takes 30-40 min to hike from the Sunrise view point to the ”Queen’s Victoria” hoodoo, But along the trail, you can see different hoodoos at different angles and height, also there are some arches for you to pass through, it makes the hike more interesting. There is a “I hike the hoodoos” benchmark for you to scan (using pencil) or take picture, if you collect 3 benchmark of “I hike the hoodoos”, then you can go to visitor center to get a prize (it’s a sticker at the time when we hiked, not sure if it will change to other gift later). After the the ”Queen’s Victoria” hoodoo, you can walk back to your staring point or you can go to the Navajo trail, we choose to go to the Navajo trail, then we can get another the ”I hike the hoodoos” benchmark, it’s about 30 min walk from the “Queen’s Victoria” hoodoo, so the trail we hiked is called the “Queen’s garden / Navajo combination loop”, the loop with end up at the Sunset point (as we start at Sunrise point) (but if you starts at sunset point, it will end up at sunrise point)."

This way we did not have to turn around and hike same spot over.  But really it was beautiful, even that would have been amazing.  Queens garden trail is a gentle slope down the entire way.  Amazing, a must.  Beauty around every corner.  The sights were so amazing and different, that you were always in awe.  The temperatures were very hot, so we started at dawn.  Bring lots of water.  We beat the heat and the crowds.  We had good hiking shoes (but could prob do with good running shoes).  We started at Sunrise point, ended at sunset point.  Chose to do the switchbacks at the end.

It descends into the Bryce Canyon Amphitheater and there are wonderful views of rock formations (hoodoos).  It can be combined with the Navajo Trail for a longer more difficult hike.  It has less elevation change than Navajo Trail and is the easiest hike that goes down into the amphitheater.  My son and I explored Queen's Garden Trail on horseback with Canyon Trail Rides and that was a great way to explore the trail.  Along this trail we saw many trees that had been hit by lightning. Evidently Bryce Canyon is a very dangerous place to be in a thunderstorm.  However, there was a beauty even to the charred trees.  This place is really wonderful.  "

Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Queen's Garden Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,The Best Bryce Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail was recommended to us and it did not disappoint. The Queens Garden trail takes you down into the canyon and between all of the formations. We followed it around and came up through the Wall Street section and it was well worth the effort. The one thing we learned was that Bryce is 9000ft above sea level so catching your breath was a real thing. We just used an easy pace and took several breaks on the climb out of the canyon. DO IT you will not regret it!

Unfortunately, you could not walk to the point for the ice and snow.  However, we did get high enough to see across the amphitheater.  We also got a great view west of the horizon at twilight with its colors.  From here it was interesting to see the valley to the north we came through on our trip from Capitol Reef.  You could really see how the canyon was made on the east side of the ledge.  This is a better view of the entire amphitheater and I recommend you visit. "

Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Point,Observation Decks & Towers,5.0,Must stop to see this view ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There are no words to describe this amazing view. We followed the shuttle drivers suggestion of hiking the rim trail starting at Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. This is considered a moderate hike. My husband is know to slip on hikes so I was a bit concerned. But he had no problem. The trail is very well maintained but it is narrow in some places. If you are afraid of heights this hike is not for you. I was scared at first but was more used to it in the end. You are walking on the rim of the amphitheater half of the way. The other half of the way you walk through trees and it is shady and lovely. Once in a lifetime experience. We started the hike at 8:30 and it was breezy and not too hot.

We, there was 6 of us ranging from 14 to 70 took our time hiking and photographing, picnicking along the way. We arrived at the Sunset end of the hike and proceeded to go uphill. It was an extremely stressful and difficult part of the hike. I had to constantly stop and rest along with a few others along the way that were about my age. I am not an avid hiker but I do my fair share. It seems it would have been better to go down at the Sunset side and go up and the Sunrise side, but we were assured that there were more hiking accidents that happened doing that so we went with their suggestion. If I had it to do over again I think I would take my chances and proceed differently. But all in all it was an awesome beautiful hike"

If you get all the way up to the paved overlook, you'll get a glimpse of the community of Tropic in the distance. But views between here and Sunset Point are all pretty spectacular. So you might not want to hike the last uphill portion. You can make it a nice sunset return hike from either parking. Or you can walk one way and do the return on the shuttle bus. Parking might get tight on summer weekends, so once you're parked anywhere around the main rim, it would be best to leave your vehicle there and use your feet and the bus shuttle to get around. Note that the paved bike trail is also useful as a connector."

The view is spectacular, but I think the view from the point at Bryce Point just up the road and from Aqua Canyon and Black Birch Canyon viewpoints on the scenic drive are more inspiring. On the plus side, there are less crowds here because the parking  lot is smaller so  a lot of the big groups skip it in favor of Bryce Point. If you are pushing a stroller or wheelchair or using a cane or other walking aid, you might call it perspiration point instead because the view point is up a paved, but short and steep, path to the top of the hill."

We were very glad we followed her advice, as the descent into the canyon from Sunrise was not too bad.  Once at the bottom, we thoroughly enjoyed being amongst the pines.  Marveling at the views and walls and hoodoos from the ground up is amazing.  We followed the trail to Queens garden and then up and out through Navajo..  What waited for us on the trail up and out was Wall Street.  Words cannot describe this section.  I felt like we were in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade movie set in the Sinai.  Just amazing and going up and out to Sunset point was, we felt much easier especially with the added bonus of Wall Street on the way.  I think if you go the other way (Sunset to Sunrise) you get the surprises way too quickly.  Just my opinion of course.  "

There was plenty of parking. After enjoying the breath taking views we started our hike around 7:40am in a clockwise direction. The descent was gradual and very easy. What a beautiful hike on a cool morning Sunday. We’ve been on plenty of hikes, none like this. Every turn and switchback offered something new. You’ve got to do both the queen and Navajo loop trails. Unfortunately for us, Wall Street was washed out so we couldn’t add that hike but that was our plan. If traveling clockwise, the last 25 min of the hike is steep. We are all in good shape and went slow and steady while taking pics to rest and did just fine.  Folks with hip and knee issues might want to use hiking sticks to help get up the trail. We brought enough water and snacks to get us thru. Took about 1:36 to finish. Would have been longer with Wall Street. Very easy and enjoyable hike.

We arrived at the park around 7:00 pm.  Did the loop from sunrise to sunset point and we only saw a couple of other groups.  We went to Inspiration Point to watch the sunset and that wasn't as crowded as it was at Sunset Point.
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Absolutely stunning ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is absolutely fantastic. Try to do it counter clockwise (sunrise to sunset) as the steepest section will be downhill in the beginning. Getting to see all the hoodoos you’re close was awesome. There is a mix of sun and shade so plan accordingly. Definitely make sure to bring lots of water as it is quite dry. My shoes and legs were coated in dust. Ha! And it was nice to visit this National Park instead of the nearby Zion, as it was a lot less crowded. There were a few times we felt so alone on the trail. "
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,The best hike in Bryce,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A great hike between Sunrise and Sunset Points. We started at Sunrise taking the Queens Garden trail and opted for the Wall Street trail, exiting at Sunset Point. It is a moderate hike especially the switch backs at the Wall Street end. Took around 3 hours. About 3 miles in length. Highly recommended."
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Navajo/Queens Garden Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Stunning,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiked this loop with my husband and 6 and 10 year old Kids. Started at Sunset Point and walked over to Sunrise Point and then started Queens Garden. Absolutely amazing hike. The whole family enjoyed it. Beautiful views! Loved hiking in and out of the canyon. Trails were packed down, we all had yak tracks which helped in areas to make things easier. We got to the trailhead earlier in the morning. By the time we were done around 1:15 Sunset Point parking lot was completely full with people waiting for parking spots."
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Canyon National Park,Geologic Formations,5.0,MOST AWESOME SCENERY I'VE EVER SEEN IS AT BRYCE CANYON,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I visited Bryce Canyon about a dozen years ago and vowed to return. On my second more recent trip there, my wife and I again hiked into the canyon and did the Navaho Trial though Wall Street and then came up the Queens Garden Trail on our return. It took us a very leisurely 2 1/2 hours. Being in our mid to upper 60's and considering the elevation of over 8,000 feet, I would advise avoiding a hike during the heat of the day. My wife is in excellent shape but being on a beta blocker, she had difficulty ascending the hike back up. For most people in reasonable shape this is a very manageable hike. I got up before sunrise both of our mornings and Sunset Point is spectacular at sunrise. The two trails we hiked feature spectacular scenery of the famous rock formations called hoodoos. Peekaboo Loop looks even more awesome but is a much more demanding and lengthier hike.  As there are limited options in and around Bryce, I would highly recommend staying at the Bryce Lodge for convenience and value. But you have to book the property way in advance to get the dates you want. I think an arrival in the afternoon followed by one full day and one more morning is the perfect amount of time if you want to hike into the canyon. (2 nights) We went in mid to late September which was perfect. I'm guessing late May to mid June would be equally good timing as the nights can get cold even in May and September. We've been to all of the national parks in Utah and Arizona. Bryce is the gem of them all. Hiking below and along the hoodoos watching them change colors is simply awesome and unforgettable."

Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Canyon National Park,Geologic Formations,5.0,Things to do in one day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I traveled with my husband and 19-year old son. We started our day at 8 am and went to the Shuttle Stop across from Ruby’s Inn. We purchased a park pass which gave us access to the free shuttle to take us through Bryce National Park. We stopped first at the Visitor Center and immediately went to the Information Tent outside. I signed us up for the Night Ranger Talk held at the North Amphitheater at 9pm. They only allow 40 people during COVID so you must sign up the same day and early. Then we hopped back on the shuttle and went to Bryce Point. This was one of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. You can see the entire amphitheater from this view point. We took the advice from the shuttle driver and hiked the Rim Trail from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point about a 1.5 mile hike. If you are afraid of heights do not go. I was at first but then was so glad I went. It was a moderate hike and I would not take young children. Some parts are very narrow and the edge is very close. We hiked to Inspiration Point and hopped back on the shuttle back to the Shuttle Stop where we started. My son then rented a mountain bike for $25 for half a day and rode an 8 mile trail to Red Rock Canyon. I picked him up at the Tunnel. Then we rested back in our room. We went for dinner at The Pizza Place in Tropic and on our way back we stopped at Mossy Cave hike. It is very easy about half a mile and there is a small waterfall that you can walk behind. This was a great stop and highlight of our trip. Then we went back to room and rested and left for our night program at 8:30. The outdoor amphitheater has benches and a movie screen. The ranger spoke about animals seen at the canyon. One is the best parts was you could see a million stars in the sky just from sitting in the amphitheater. The ranger talk lasted 40 minutes and we were done for the day at 10 pm. Awesome day! 
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Canyon National Park,Geologic Formations,5.0,Great fall visit to terrific park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Visited in November 2022, but I only had about 2 1/2 hours to spare.  After paying the $35 entrance fee, I told the park ranger I had limited time because I was on my way to Springdale and she suggested driving the 28 miles to the top at Rainbow Point and turning back and visiting the scenic pullovers on the way down, which I did.  At Rainbow Point, the altitude was over 9100 feet, so I got a headache as I got out to view the stunning scenery.  As I drove back, I repeatedly pulled over to the scenic overlooks and admired them as I took many photos.  However, there were several inches of snow on the ground and it was compacted and frozen on the walkways so you had to be careful with your footing.  In fact, I witnessed one woman fall on her back, fortunately, she was not hurt.  Due to the nature of the icy and snowy conditions, I would recommend good hiking boots with good traction.  "
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Canyon National Park,Geologic Formations,5.0,Bryce Canyon Heavenly Trails,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Because of the Pandemic, I drove from California to Denver to visit my son and his wife. On the way back I spent a day at Bryce Canyon National Park. I had seen so many photos I was worried that nothing could really be so dramatic, I was wrong, photos don't do it justice!  The expansive landscape of salmon colored Hodoo towers and Fin ridges is other worldly and the park is much larger in person."
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Canyon National Park,Geologic Formations,5.0,Beautiful concentration of Hoodoos,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This NP took my breath away because it is just unreal how the hoodoos jet up from the ground with incredible colors that look different depending on how the sun hits it. We did the Queen gardens trail going down into the hoodoos and came back up through the Navajo trail (Wallsteet). This is a bit challenging if not in a good shape, but it is well worth the hike. The total hike was about 4.5miles. Take your water, hat, and sunscreen with you. Plenty of rock squirrels and chipmunks. The amphitheater is just stunning. We visited late in the morning and parking was not an issue. The annual pass is a great way to see multiple NPs and it can be purchased from any of the NPs entry. We used ours to access 6 NPs in 2 weeks. It’s good for a year and costs $80. Entry to Bryce Canyon alone is $35 per car. We stayed in Kanab and drove 1.5hrs for a day trip to Bryce. Kanab is an easy launch pad for seeing Zion and Bryce and the city also has plenty to offer on its own."

Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Canyon National Park,Geologic Formations,5.0,Spectacular scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you're planning a trip to Zion National Park, I highly recommend to see Bryce Canyon as well.  It's totally worth it to see all those majestic red-orange hoodoos looming in the background. We stopped at all the lookout locations that were available. You get amazing views looking from above along the rim, and equally good views looking up from the canyon too. The pictures do not do it justice. You have to go and make it happen so you can see it for yourself.  We were here early morning in July 2021 with very few crowds but still decent weather to enjoy the outdoors."
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Canyon National Park,Geologic Formations,5.0,A must see!!!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Of all of the National Parks in Utah this is my new favorite.  So much to do on a two day visit.  Many hiking options but also many scenic views to enjoy if hiking isn't your thing.  The food options aren't great in Bryce City and are pricey so bring food with you if possible.  
Bryce Canyon National Park,Utah (UT),Bryce Canyon National Park,Geologic Formations,5.0,Must do National Park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful views! They had just gotten a lot of snow so some of the hikes were closed and some of the walks were snowy/icy. We did Inspiration point, Bryce point, Sunset point, and Sunrise. Inspiration point parking was icy and a few people got stuck trying to get in. We had a 4 wheel drive care so we didn’t have any problems. Just to see the views is worth the $35 fee. You receipt is good for 7 days so if you are planning on spending a few days hiking it’s extremely worth the cost. The visitors center is really nice and the park staff is super helpful. They are very knowledgeable and can help with any of your trail questions. I definitely recommend hiking boots and chains in the snow. We had on sneakers and they didn’t have enough traction. Overall amazing! Can’t wait to go back in the spring so we can hike. "
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Boca Chita Key,Historic Sites,4.0,"Beautiful Underwater National Park, relaxing boat ride",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Biscayne National Park is 95% underwater, so unless you snorkel or scuba, you will not be ""seeing"" the great majority of the park.  We took the 3 hour r/t boat ride to see Boca Chita Key.  It was a lovely day and the ride was pleasant - an hour out, an hour on the key and an hour boat ride back to the visitors center.  We climbed up the decorative lighthouse, walked around the Key, ate the lunch we brought with us on the small beach and admired the view. Nothing to shout about, but it was pretty and we learned a bit about the history of the area from the boat ""captain"".  Had the water been clearer and the sky not been overcast, we would have taken the snorkel option, it just wasn't a good day for a snorkeling adventure. We enjoyed touring the Visitor's Center when we returned.  Actually the highlight of the day for us was seeing manatees swimming in the canal right outside the park entrance.  We're from the west coast, so we'd never had the opportunity and it was cool.  We're glad we went and would go back to do some in the water activities next time we're in the area."

We arrived via sailboat.  Luckily our draft was just 3 feet> the entry channel is a pretty shallow  patch.  Tied up at horseshoe shaped marina dock. Easy to find a spot.  Light breeze kept bugs away from our boat, but if you venture inland you better have LOTS of bug spray on.  Lots of picnic benches and grills. No concessions for sale so bring what you want to eat and drink and carry tour trash away. Lighthouse is fun to visit but is locked unless a tour guide is handy.  Immaculate grounds ! So a relaxing spot to watch the water and if you overnight, the lighted Miami skyline."

You can walk the hike and see the lighthouse all within an hour.  The hike is mostly covered by the tropical foliage, then there is a open field where the Barn that the parties used to be held at and finally the Northern end has clean beaches and the Faux Lighthouse.

Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Boca Chita Key,Historic Sites,4.0,Worst National Park in the Country,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the Worst National Park experience I’ve ever had. First, the boat ride out was soaking wet. We couldn’t look around because the sea spray was so intense we had to keep our heads down. Then when we got to Boca Chita, it was Party Central, filled with yachts blaring music and loud, drunken people. Yes, the lighthouse was interesting—but mostly because it was “a fancy lawn ornament,” in the words of our guide. It is not now nor has ever been a functioning lighthouse. The bridge for the trail was put, so there was nothing to explore beyond the yachts. I’ve never before wanted less time at a park, but I couldn’t wait to leave. Terrible experience and I’ll never go back under any circumstances!!"

It is one hour on a boat there, one hour back and a little over an hour on the island. On our way over, we experienced something rare in Florida according to our boat Captain, fog. Once we neared the island though, all that disappeared. The island itself is a tiny gem. With beautiful views and paths around the island, I found it very fun to explore. He lighthouse is pretty quaint as well.  Our tour allowed us access to it and the nice view of the area. The water was so clear there we were able to see a shark and a sting ray very clearly. Our guide gave us a history of the island as well. On the way back, we got to stop for a bit to see a group of 8-10 dolphins playing in the water and feeding. A great trip! "

The boat tour was just OK. We had expected there to be more of an informative narrative during the 45 minute trip each way to and from the key. But there was virtually nothing. There was a naturalist on board, Spencer, who worked at the Biscayne bay Institute. But she didn’t talk more than five minutes for an intro when we got on the boat and five minutes when we were on the island. I guess I expected that during the boat ride they would talk about the wildlife, history and about the park. My tween and teen kids thought the boat ride was boring but the island was cool. We did not feel like this boat trip. We did not feel this boat ride was very representative of the Biscayne bay national park.  I’d suggest to pick a different experience. Also, if you sit in front expect to get wet."
Biscayne National Park,Florida (FL),Boca Chita Key,Historic Sites,4.0,Unique National Park that is mostly all water!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Biscayne National Park is mostly all water so to enjoy it, you need to spend time on or in the water!  We took a 4 hour trip from the Park to Boca Chita Key which is a tiny Key off the coast of Biscayne.  The water was pretty rough so our ride was also a little rough, but a LOT of wet spray unless you were lucky enough to get the back seats!  We had no idea to expect this so be warned if you take this trip!  It was a beautiful hot day so it did not ruin our experience.  Upon arrival at the Key, we were allowed to climb the small decommissioned lighthouse which was kinda cool!  History of the Key was very interesting.  Definitely worth the trip.  Don't need to spend a huge amount of time here...our tour gave us about an hour, which was plenty."

Family of adults with 7, 10, and 12 year old kids enjoyed this! Seeing the lighthouse (we got lucky and were there when it was open to climb), the beach, and the beautiful water were highlights. There is a “hike”/walking path that was not secluded or particularly beautiful. Unfortunately, visitors have left trash around there. Definitely a party vibe with multiple different boats around the island playing loud music. The water is beautiful and clear!"

So much to do. Spend some time exploring this park.

The Boca Chita Island itself is pretty neat, very pretty and interesting to hear about the history and see the current sailors come in to use it for a rest spot. Our guides were Jessica and Jamie who were great!"

Short, flat trail for the most part and then a little climb to get to the balanced rock at the end. Kids loved climbing on the boulders. Trail is pretty exposed as far as the sun goes so we warmed up quickly even in December. You could probably make it to the trailhead in a car if you go slow as we didn’t think our 4wd was necessary, but we did see someone attempting the road pulling a camper and there’s just not a great place to turn around if the lot is full."

The full 17 miles took us about 8 hours (included a long lunch and other breaks). It was worth the time to go out to South Rim. South Rim also makes a good mid-day lunch and picnic spot if you connect all the trails like we did. As of March 2020, North Rim was closed. Otherwise, we would have connected it with North Rim too."

Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),The South Rim Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Do Not Be Intimidated By The Miles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Granted, I am used to walking many miles a day so the 13.5 round trip hike to the South Rim via Pinnacles and back down via Lagunas was not too much of a stretch for me. When I did the hike, the weather was in the 60s and the skies were clear with just a few puffy clouds. I recommend taking the Pinnacle Trail up to the South Rim Trail. This route has a lot of switchbacks and shade that makes the elevation/distance much more manageable. As you hike this portion you will see everything from grassy meadows to Manzanita and cacti. From the end of the Pinnacle Trail, I took the South Rim Trail past waterfalls and grassy meadows until hitting the South Rim. From there, you can gaze at the beautiful mountains of Mexico. To spare your knees and quads, take the Laguna trail down. You will see beautiful rocks and vistas. Hiking poles are helpful but not essential. When you arrive back at the lodge, you can order a  few beers and watch the sun set and then eat a rich dinner knowing that you just ascended 8000' and walked over thirteen miles. The Big Bend Lodge is priced fairly and the food is good."

I'm happy to say I was hugely mistaken, and that the trip to the South Rim is easily one of my favorite hikes I have done. It takes some work to get there, but the payoff is huge and the views unforgettable."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),The South Rim Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Great Day Hike, Fabulous Views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The south rim loop is well documented as one of the best hikes in Texas. the total length of the loop is about 13 miles from the main Chisos Basin Lodge and back.  All the hiking guides say this is a strenuous 1 day hike, better done as a 2 day with a camping stopover.  We went over the new year (so the weather was mild) and started out at 9:00am expecting not to make it all the way around in one trip. There are some easy options to cut the hike short if necessary. As it turned out we had plenty of time to complete the whole South Rim loop including time for lunch and lots of photo stops. We don't consider ourselves particularly fast hikers (often overtaken in fact) - especially with many photo stops - but still hiked the whole loop easily in under 7 hours.  We would recommend going in the anti-clockwise direction to avoid the steeper initial uphill climb. We did not include the North rim loop which adds another 3.5 miles. The walk and the views are of course fabulous and highly recommended."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),The South Rim Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Gorgeous Hike and very Unique,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've been on hikes in Glacier, Yosemite, and Zion but this hike in the Chisos Mountains of Big Bend NP was so incredibly different.  A buddy of mine accompanied me on this first time trip to Big Bend and we are both in our lower 60's from the Austin, Tx area.  We stayed in Terlingua Ghost Town so the drive to the trailhead was about 45 minutes.  Big Bend is so vast and so remote that Terlingua was the closest place we could find to stay other than the Chisos Mountain Lodge in the park.  What an experience Ghost Town Terlingua was though.  Wow, about as close as you can get to the end of the world.  But the people there that we met were very friendly as expected. On to the hike....We took the advice of a very knowledgeable Park Ranger - Donnie - and started up the Pinnacle Trail.  This trail (all of them for that matter) was well maintained and marked and we never ever saw any trash.  The ascent was about 2,000 feet up to an elevation of around 7,000 ft.  We stopped every 1.5 miles for a breather and water which was a good plan for us old guys.  We then entered the Boot Canyon Trail.  To our surprise this was a really cool (literally) trail.  Very shady and pretty easy but great views of the canyons.  We saw lots of birds, some of which I'd never seen before.  We climbed maybe another couple of hundred feet to the South Rim Trail for a totally ascent of 2,400 feet.  And wow, unbelievable views from the South Rim.  Like the song from Asleep at the Wheel - Miles and Miles of Texas.  We were simply mesmerized by the views from the different vantage points along the trail.  The descent along the Laguna Meadows Trail was long and hot but easy on the joints.  No difficult stairs or step-downs.  Our total time was 7 hours and 45 minutes but our stops were well planned out and we stuck to our 1.5 mile plan.  I am not in the best of shape and was reluctant to try it but it was well worth it and off my bucket list....  But I think I'll do it again!"
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),The South Rim Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Fantastic, but best to spend as much time as possible on the rim itself",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've done the hike three times twice as a day hike and once for overnight camping. Four recommendations. First if possible take a day to do the Maxwell scenic drive and study the scenery from ground level that you'll be taking in the next day from the rim. This will increase your appreciation of the spectacular views from the rim. Second, next day hike up to the rim by whatever trails you want because there isn't much you will see on the way up or down that you can't see something similar elsewhere in the park. But there is only one South Rim. So take in the sights on the way up briefly as part of rest stops but do not linger on the hike any longer than necessary to rest . The longer you spend on the rim itself, the more you will enjoy and truly appreciate  the spectacular views. Put another way, in my experience 15 to 30 minutes spent on the rim is 15 to 30 minutes wasted. We spend 3 to 3 &1/2 hours on the rim itself on a day hike. It takes that kind of time to really absorb what you will be looking at and the longer you stay on the rim the more reluctant you will be to start back down. "

If it has rained recently, you will need a high clearance vehicle. There are many old abandoned buildings to explore and get some good pics. Once on the trail it is about 1/3 of a mile along the river bank to get there. There is a sign, that says “Healing Waters,” and just go another 100 feet to find the Hot Springs.  The Springs are not very deep, mostly 2 feet,  and 3 feet in some places.  Water does get muddy at times"

My boyfriend and I love to go at night and have done so on our previous 6 times here. Last night was scary. Upon entering, there is a sign that states “frequent car break ins”. There was a trailer truck there that someone was obviously sleeping in but it was so sketchy. I had the sensation that it was not safe to go. We turned our car around quickly. When we left, there is an area on the road that is barricaded off, I saw a car parked in the dark behind the barricades. We drove by the car and there were 2 very sketchy looking men in the front seat that tried to hide when our headlights hit them. Just please be very careful."

We did the hike beyond just seeing the hot springs.  We went early and saw almost no one except for some young people in the spring. They were very nice and from a nearby town. Yes, the water was hot, about 105 degrees. We didn't get in but we felt it. An amazing sight right on the Rio Grande River (USA side of the river too).  The hike was interesting with the historical facts we learned along the way.  Well worth seeing."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Hot Springs Historic District,Historic Sites,4.0,Littlebit of history and hot/cold bath included,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The road is little-bit sketchy for small car like ours but we took the chance and it worked. There is nice interpretive area about old bath houses and motel. Short walk from there everybody can enjoy hot or cold bath. Hot water from hot spring is overflowing to the river and makes it easier to get into that cold water. In the sun was probably over 80F so we spent more time in the river than hot pool.
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Hot Springs Historic District,Historic Sites,4.0,WARNING! Could Be Hazardous to YOUR Health!!!,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"OK, I'll admit I am a hot spring junkie...have traveled the world and been to many. This was hands down THE WORST hot spring I've ever been to EVER! BEWARE!!! It is right beside the Rio Grande River that reeked of sewage. There were what appeared to be pollution/ detergent-looking bubbles in the water and around the banks. The historic hot pool, encased in cement was full of muck and mud and the water was filthy. The only clear spot was where the hot spring came up from the ground. I made the mistake of stepping into the pool and my sandal got stuck in the muck and broke so I had to limp back to the car with burned feet on a 92 degree day! Thinking: what a fool I was for not realizing how dangerous these polluted waters were BEFORE I stuck my fricking foot in! Keep in mind that 3rd world Mexico is right on the other side of the river and God knows what they are throwing in there! I think you can use your imagination to figure this one out. This is a WARNING: if you have a cut, a low immune system, or children with you, please be advised that soaking in this hot spring by the Rio Grande may lead to your demise. Just smell the stench in the air and you will know what I am talking about. I didn't feel particularly safe in this park and would NEVER consider camping out here. This was a long drive for a very disappointing day. I couldn't get out of there fast enough!"
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Hot Springs Historic District,Historic Sites,4.0,SIMPLY AWESOME,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I had read various reviews stating this should be done in the morning for there to be less people. I decided to get there as early as possible leaving the Chisos Mountains Lodge at 7AM. You have to take a dirt road to get to the Hot Springs and should just take it slow. The Hot Springs are about a 15 minute walk from the parking lot. Upon getting to the Hot Springs there was a family of three already there, but they were getting ready to take off. The weather was cold, at about 32 or 34 degrees, so i was covered in many layers. I was looking at the area when the lady asked me if I planning on getting in and to be honest I really wasn't even considering it anymore considering how cold it was, in my opinion. She mentioned not wanting to get into the hot springs but totally thinking it was worth it once inside. The family left and I decided to get it. IT WAS AMAZING. The water felt to hot at first but then your body adjusts. This should be a must if visiting Big Bend National Park, just do it early though."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Hot Springs Historic District,Historic Sites,4.0,Combine Hot Springs Historic Loop with Hot Springs Canyon Rim for Fantastic Views of Rio Grande!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the combined Hot Springs Canyon Rim Trail plus the Hot Springs Trail for a combined total distance of approximately 5.7 miles RT.  We started at the trailhead at Hot Springs and after visiting the Hot Springs historic buildings, we continued our hike to the Rio Grande overlook where we ate our packed lunch with an absolutely gorgeous view.  The trail actually continues to the Daniels Ranch near Rio Grande Village, but we didn't go that far.  This is a quite rugged trail with lots of ups and downs and loose rock.  I would rate it Moderate.  It took us 3 hours and 45 minutes for this hike, including our lunch stop.  On our return hike, we enjoyed watching two riders on horseback on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.  They started up quite high and continued all the way down to the river to tend to their cattle.  Such a great view!  If you don't have the time, nor energy to do the combined hike, then be sure to do the Hot Springs Loop  Hike of 1.0 mile, it does get you up high above the Rio Grande for a great view!"
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Hot Springs Historic District,Historic Sites,4.0,Great Highlight of Big Bend,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It isn't Big Bend without the Rio Grande, and one of the unique things (of many) along the Rio Grande is the geothermal activity. Thanks to a failed resort (1909) and the hard work of whomever excavated the stone to create a square shallow tub, this is a relaxing & downright enjoyable 'for free' spa. "
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Hot Springs Historic District,Historic Sites,4.0,"This could be really nice, but it isn't",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a collection of ruins from the early 1900s for the most part of a small hot springs-resort/ healing center.  The hot springs (two on the American side and three on the Mexican side) function but they are nothing more than what is left of the century-old U.S. facility developed by the Langford (and Natividad) family.  As such, the hot springs are modest beyond belief and aresomewhat of an embarrassment to the NPS.  Why not spend some money and make this little historic area into a major tourist attraction within the greater Big Bend National Park?  It could still be ""green"" but would be producing revenues of a significant size as well.  If Uncle Sam can't afford to upgrade the site, give it to a concessionaire who can.  "
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Emory Peak,Mountains,5.0,Steep hike worth the view.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Excellent views made the steep hike worth it. Took about 7 hours (including breaks) for the 11 miles. I’m in okay shape, (jog 3-5mi 4x a week) and I had to break multiple times to take a breather. However, I wasn’t wearing the greatest shoes for hiking and was carrying quite a bit of weight in backpack, cameras & solar chargers which I don’t regret bringing! I drank 2L of water while my friend drank about 4-5L. I used walking sticks for the first time and was oh so glad I opted to bring them. Unfortunately we didn’t see much wildlife, maybe that’s a plus for some. Did see 1 deer on the trail, didn’t scare. Overall I’d recommend the hike if you’re in decent shape, even if you can get half way up you’ll be able to see great views."

Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Emory Peak,Mountains,5.0,"Challenging hike, but well worth the effort!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a hike for the faint of heart (literally!).  With elevations ranging from 5400 ft. to almost 7900 ft. over 4.5 miles, this is a tough hike that will have you huffing and puffing your way to the top, but it's well worth it if you like a challenge, abundant wildlife, and amazing panoramic views.  We saw many deer, unusual lizards, and many different birds along this trail, not to mention the jaw-dropping beautiful views along the way.  Although we did not see any, there are definitely opportunities to spot black bear and mountain lion on this trail.  This is a well-used trail, fairly well maintained, although there are many sections of trail with large loose rocks and gravel that can be tough on those ankles!  The relentless ascent is broken only by a flat portion of trail through a highland meadow named Boulder Meadow.  At the top, there are two large rock crags--the one on the right is the tallest.  You must climb this 25-30 foot rock crag in order to get to the ""top""--use extreme caution if doing so, as there are sheer drops on most sides of this rock.  The short climb is not vertical, but pretty close to it--however, there are handholds and places to put your foot and a person not experienced with rockclimbing should be able to handle it (I did).  Once you're up there, just sit, relax, and enjoy the views which go all the way into Mexico and nearby mountain ranges and mesas.  Take plenty of water, a camelback is best, and I recommend leaving by 9AM, arriving at the summit around noon-1PM and eating your lunch at the summit.  Have a good rest at the top, because the descent is equally challenging, but in a different way--your knees may be screaming for mercy by the time you get down to the bottom!  Finish out your day with dinner at the Chisos Mountains Lodge restaurant--the food is pretty good and the Emory Peak Sundae is a chocolate lovers dream.  Now if you have the opportunity, don't miss the chance to stay in one of the Emory Peak Lodge rooms built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1940's.  The rooms aren't fancy, but rustic, comfortable, and an interesting piece of history.  The price is right, too--only $94 per night for two people.  My favorite room is #110 for the view.  Another option, the Lost Mine Trail, is a popular Chisos Mountains hike in Big Bend that's not quite as strenuous as Emory Peak, but possesses equally commanding views and opportunities for wildlife viewing."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Emory Peak,Mountains,5.0,To The Top of Emory Peak,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Did the hike with my Son and Son in Law. Followed Pinnacles Trail 3.5 miles to the cutoff. There is a compost toilet at the cutoff as well as bear proof boxes to store back packs. From the cutoff you have about 1.5 miles to the peak. This is a strenuous hike that gains 2500 feet on the way. We took 10-12 bottles of water for each person. It can get warm and you want to have plenty. If you are in great condition and charge straight up, I'm sure you could do it in 5-6 hours. We took our time with plenty of water and picture breaks And spent about hour and 15 minutes at the top. We took about 8 1/2 hours to complete."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Emory Peak,Mountains,5.0,Hike to the top of Big Bend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are able, definitely hike to the top of Big Bend, to the summit of Emory Peak. The hike is 8.6 miles roundtrip with 2500 ft of elevation gain which makes it a moderately strenuous hike. The hike starts near the Visitor Center at the Chisos Basin and follows the Pinnacles Trail until it splits off about 3 miles into the hike. The last part of the hike involves some rock climbing up 20-30 ft of rock face to reach the true summit. The view at the top is a spectacular 360 panorama seeing everything within Big Bend, and with the south view looking deep into Mexico - a nice reward for the effort."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Emory Peak,Mountains,5.0,Hiked Emory Peak twice,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Big Bend National Park is a little-known treasure.  Emory Peak at the top of the Chisos Mountains is right in the middle of the vast desert.  The views from the top are incredible and the smell of pines and the cooler air on the trail seem surreal as you gaze out onto the desert.  On one of the climbs, we watched a black bear and two cubs across a nearby valley.  The drive up into the Chisos with the tall spires of the century plants along the road has an other-worldly feel to it.  At the end of a full day of hiking and exploring, we always head to the hot spring and soak for an hour or two."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Emory Peak,Mountains,5.0,Spectacular views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike (adding in Pinnacles Trail) totaled approximately 11 miles from the parking lot of the Chisos Basin. The elevation gain was a gradual ascent with a few places that were steep. A LOT OF STEPS! I dubbed one the ""Exorcist"" staircase and I think you'll know it when you see it. I would say this was strenuous because of the steps, sun exposure at certain times of the day, mileage and rocks. But, there were parts that were flat and on packed dirt which helped balance out the tougher parts. I felt the only really difficult part was the last 25ft of rock climbing to get to the top, where the solar panel and antennae are. Was it worth it? I would agree with other reviewers who say the views at 7800 ft are just as stunning as 7825ft. without the fear of falling to your death or having to use more energy to climb up and down steep rock face. The views all along the way on this trail were great. We started pre-dawn at 6am and got to see morning fog roll in and get the cool air of the mountains for half of our hike. Highly recommend a pre-dawn start-just remember your headlamp or flashlight. And again, water and good traction hiking boots are also a must! I went through 3L of water and 1L of Gatorade. "

Clearly this is another one of these trails (like all of them in this part of the park) that's best hiked in early morning or late in the day.  So just walked up the hill a bit to the edge which gave you a pretty good view of the Rio Grande and the surrounding area.  You couldn't quite see the mouth of the canyon as it's far away and narrow. Not sure if you could see more at the end of the trail.  The water in the river in this location looked amazing - thick and muddy, churning with the color and consistency of a coffee milkshake.  We'd also stopped at the Boquillas Canyon overlook a few miles before the trailhead but I think the view from the trail is better."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Boquillas Canyon,Canyons,4.5,A Lush Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Boquillas Canyon isn't as imposing as Santa Elena but it is more lush and accessible. I arrived soon after dawn one weekday morning in early March and had the canyon to myself for more than an hour. The contrast between the bright green trees and vegetation and the canyon walls makes for a beautiful experience. Unlike at Santa Elena, you are not limited to a narrow trail but can walk along a much wider stretch of river bed for part of the way. The trail from the parking lot goes up a steep hill and then down again before leveling off the rest of the way. But the up-and-down section only takes 10 minutes or so."

As we returned, we stopped   along the banks in the sun to enjoy a much needed water break and watched hikers wading and ""swimming"" in the shallow waters to cool off.

The view of the ""window"" (more like a ""doorway"") at the end is worth the effort.  Last quarter mile of the trail is interesting and rocky with some steps carved into the rocks. Rocks at the pour off opening are very slippery so be sure not to get too close to the edge as it's a sheer drop.    "
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),The Window Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Go Early!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We set off on the trail at 7:45am and only saw people on our return on a Friday morning (Lost Mine Trail on Saturday already many on the trail by 8:00am). We had the view to ourselves and did not have to jockey for photos. It is very slick by the window but we felt pretty safe getting fairly close (actual harder trying to get  back out of the area due to the slickness of the rocks). I am 60 and did not feel the hike  was too strenuous. This was not our favorite hike in the park but definitely in the top three. We parked by the Chisos campground and there is designated trail parking! The trail starts between 49 -51 sites) and there is a great bathroom not far from the start. Supposedly starting from the campground helps avoid some of the uphill part. Also it’s much less chaotic than starting near the visitors station ( we stopped afterwards and lots of people setting off). Note: there ARE bears on the trail. We saw one at the very end of the hike!  Enjoy!
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),The Window Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Definitely not “easy” for most non hikers, but worth the effort!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I’m triggered by this being called an “easy, quick walk”. Definitely worth it, but it’s all incline on the way back! If you aren’t super active on the stair stepper & cardio before you go, the hike back is gonna hurt. Go plenty early so you can take the way back at your own pace. The last .1 mile involves steep stone steps with no hand rails or barriers (obviously) so if you are clumsy or scared of falling, this part may be a challenge for you. All that said, The Window is BEAUTIFUL and this was such a cool trail. We saw bears! The views are stunning the entire hike."

They warn you off the trail before sunset. Bring more water than you expect. You easily hike down to the Window and exhaustingly trudge (essentially a mile long staircase) back up.  Park at the campground to shorten that climb.

Wasn't very difficult and didn't take very long (3 miles out and 3 miles back took us 2 hours). The return is mostly uphill. We saw goats on our return.

Downhill on the way in and uphill allllll the way back so get ready! it was easy for myself and my boyfriend however we do cardio regularly at home. I will say there was a significant amount of yellowjackets at the window, which I have never been on this hike before so I don't know if this is normal or not. They were generally minding their own business but something to keep in mind if you are allergic to stings."

Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),The Window Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Butterflies everywhere. Great hike with impressive changes in vegetation and scenery.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The diversity in flora and fauna from the start to the finish was amazing.  We parked at the campground to shave about 300 ft of vertical off the hike and were glad we did.  You start in typical desert and hike down along a wash that turned into a stream.  There were butterflies everywhere and a broad diversity of trees and plants due to the stream.  The trees provided nice shady spots to just sit and listen to the birds and critters in the bushes.  Towards the end of the hike, you end up in a canyon with man made stairs to get you through the tough parts.  The views are fabulous.  There was a tarantula on the wall at the bottom so watch where you put your hands.  If you have time for only one hike, it is a tough choice between this one and Lost Mine."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),The Window Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Our Favorite Hike in Big Bend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is a moderate hike of 5.6 miles round trip from the Chisos Basin Lodge area to the Window pour-off. Going to the Window is downhill. The return of course is uphill. A volunteer at the visitor center suggested that we take this hike in the morning to reduce the sun and heat on return leg. The scenery is beautiful and varies from the lodge area to the wooded area to the rocky scrabble & steep walls near the Window. There are some concrete steps cast into the rocks to make some areas easier. Most of the stream areas were dry except after the trail splits between Oak Spring and the Window. The view at the Window is amazing. Great place to grab some rest, a snack and a drink before the uphill return. It took us three hours of hiking (RT) plus a 30-minute break at the Window pour-off."

Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Chisos Mountains,Mountains,5.0,Stunning views and lots of wildlife,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views here are amazing! I loved the scenic drive and while we were hiking near the Window Trail, there was a lot of wildlife! We saw deer, a mountain lion or big cat, black pigs, all kinds of birds, coyotes and from afar a baby bear! I went with my hubby, 2 teenagers and 2 small kids and the Window Trail was approximately 5 miles round trip, I think? It goes down at first and on the way back you are climbing up. It is a little difficult but we were able to do it. Just make sure to bring water and snacks and take rest breaks if you have never hiked before. Be careful while driving up and down the mountains. At one point, a black pig just ran out into the road in front of me. Luckily I was driving slow and was able to break and let it go across. "

Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Chisos Mountains,Mountains,5.0,"Way up 5,400 feet in all the glory of the Chisos Mountains !!!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This place is not as far away and lonely, (or hot), as Santa Elena. It was only a little over 30 minutes to get here from Panther Junction. The only thing that struck us was the altitude which is about 5,400 feet. The roads increase in elevation and wind around and around until you get to the visitor's center which has restrooms, a store, and some trails. The two main attractions are the butte and an overlook called the Window. The is a heavy traffic area as well, since there is a lodge here. The trail that goes down to the Window is steep and the elevation will make you feel dizzy, so make frequent stops and drink plenty of water. There are many pine trees and cactus plants that make great photos. You can even see the hazy azure outline of  Mount Emory, the park's highest mountain from the overlook above the trail. It's worth the visit and an easy hike for those who don't have the time or the stamina for more difficult hiking and climbs"

Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Chisos Mountains,Mountains,5.0,Beautiful hike with friends,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I had been wanting to visit Big Bend National Park for years, and the park did not disappoint.  The Chisos Mountains was my favorite part, because it represented a stark contrast to the canyons along the Rio Grande River.  When hiking up Lost Mine Trail, the terrain was constantly shifting.  I have hiked mountains in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Colombia, Taiwan, and Malaysia before this, and I have to say that the Chisos Mountains offered a new terrain and experience for me.  I would highly recommend visiting the park and hiking the Lost Mine Trail."

Do we found our parking spot at 6:45am and went with our 8 year old. The trail is very clear and easy to see, even in the dark. It's a steady easy/moderate climb for 1 mile, that is totally worth going at any time if the day, but during sun rise it was very special. We decided to continue climbing and ended up going all the way to the end of the trail, which is more climbing. The view is spectacular in the end as well. It took us 2.5 hours to climb and 1.5 to get back to the car."
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Lost Mine Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Favorite hike in Big Bend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed every trail we did in Big Bend but this almost 5 mile hike up and back was our favorite. The views are simply spectacular. If I can recommend anything is to get there early. Parking is limited at the trailhead. Also in October, though chilly at 8:00am, you warm up quickly so you will be happy to hike up in the shade. The hike up is primarily switchbacks (which makes it an easier downhill as well) so doable for me at 60. There was not a moment in this hike without great views. Make sure you keep walking across the rocks to get to the very top with amazing vistas. This is a must do in the Park. "
Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Lost Mine Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best Hike we did at Big Bend!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the first hike we did at Big Bend National Park and it really wowed us!  We were staying in Alpine so it was a long 2 hour drive to parking.  We arrived around 8:40 am on Friday, October 29 and the small lot which holds 15 cars were pretty full already.  Only noticed 5 empty spots left.  There is another curve area next to it that holds 5 cars.  So in total, 20 parking spots are available.  Due to the limited parking, it also allows for few hikers on this trail.  "

We arrived at 7:45 and there were still spots available for parking so we drove to the visitors center really fast to use the restroom (there are none at the trailhead) and came back. Chilly morning and the sun was blocked by the ridge for most of the hike, but later in the day it probably gets pretty warm. Two kids under 10 were able to make it up and back in under 3 hours with lots of stops for snacks and to climb rocks. Main parking and both overflow lots were full when we ended so people were walking all the way from the visitors center, so plan to arrive early."

If you don’t want to go all the way up, there were several good views less than a mile into hike. I would say we are moderately experienced and the only thing that’s tough about the hike is the last stretch of the switchbacks."

Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Santa Elena Canyon,Canyons,5.0,"Nice view, takes awhile to get there",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Santa Elena Canyon was worth the drive to the far end of the park (plus you get all the scenery on Ross Maxwell Drive). Other than the steps at the beginning, it's an easy walk totaling 1.8 miles round trip (it's an out and back trail that follows the canyon to a dead end). There's also a small beach at the start and it's a great place for kids to play in the water. We were there during peak season and it was controlled chaos. The parking lot was full mid day and ranger were telling people to park a mile away at a scenic viewpoint and walk to the canyon entrance. So I'd recommend going early or late in the day. I'm surprised to see it's ranked #1 of things to do in BBNP though because I wouldn't rank it my number one activity out of the week's worth of things we did. I wouldn't bother with the hike though if you plan on taking a river trip through it (a canoe or kayak trip in the canon is a must do in my opinion)."

Big Bend National Park,Texas (TX),Santa Elena Canyon,Canyons,5.0,We hiked; rafting might be better,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took as many short hikes as we could during our visit to Big Bend.  This might have been my favorite - partly because of the challenge to figure out how to start.  The Park Service tells you to wade across Terlingua Creek (and you can see the trailhead across the creek), but many times the water is too high.  There is another way, up creek, but the Park Service won't tell you about it because it is considered dangerous.  The two of us averaged 71 years and we made it although my heart was beating fast as we climbed up.  It took us about 15 minutes to get to the ""real"" trailhead.  The Park Service should install a pontoon bridge to the trailhead, so everyone can avoid the nasty climb along Terlingua Creek to get to Santa Elena Canyon hike trailhead.  In any case, once we got to the real trailhead the hike was marvelous, up to a view point and then down along the canyon for awhile."

Check out the desert overlook a few miles before Santa Elena off of Ross Maxwell Drive if the sun is rising. The overlook is just a couple minutes walk from the parking area and offers terrific early morning views. I've attached a couple of photos. As to Santa Elena, I was the first one there at about 7 a.m. on an early March morning and had the canyon to myself for about an hour. For me, at least, having few, if any, other people around greatly enhances the outdoors experience."

This is a great hike, short but vertical.  For me the short length did not make the vertical strenuous but it is very steep.  The other challenge is the badlands are a flakey, slippery soil.  This is not such a problem going up but can be going down.  If you have good hiking boots this should not be a problem with short steps.  Despite some challenges, this is a MUST DO hike, second to Notch.  The views are amazing both in route but especially at the top.  Our group really enjoyed this hike as one of the most fun things we did on our day in the the park.  This section gives you the best views of the Wall, including is own littler Matterhorn, which is a kind of symbol for the park.

Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Door Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Easy Hike to a Fun Uncharted Experience - Badlands Must Do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is short easy trail that opens to an uncharted Badlands experience.  In the midst of a badland wall, there is an opening but unlike ""The Window"", this is not just a viewing space.  It is truly a portal into the badlands.  After getting some great pictures here, our group set out across the badlands just to see what we could find.  Where the trail and parking lot at the Door are crowded, the excursion into the uncharted badlands was refreshingly sparse.  Again the trail is so aptly named and it will provide great views.  However, to really experience, you need to venture into the uncharted badlands on your own.   For this reason and experience, it is a Badlands - MUST DO."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Door Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Absolutely loved it ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent part of our morning at this trailhead and did the Notch, Window, and Door trails (plus some extra climbing along the rocks), and while fairly busy and popular, I didn’t think it was difficult to social distance. I thoroughly enjoyed this hike; the boardwalk takes you to the end, and you can continue on into the rocks if you desire. Be sure to follow the yellow poles because I can see how it’d be easy to get lost and disoriented, especially in the heat. Go to the end, and just slightly past the “end of trail” sign is a rocky outcropping where you can sit and take it all in. The canyon views are stunning. Definitely recommend! "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Door Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Great views, fun relatively easy hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I really enjoyed this trail.  The boardwalk part of the trail is quite short but once the boardwalk ends there are trail markers that continue for another half a mile or so.  The non-boardwalk trail was relatively flat but not a defined trail and more of exploring the best way along the rocks to the next trail marker.  (I'm not the most coordinated hiker and could manage it pretty easily but would recommend sturdy shoes).  The overlook at the ""End of Trail"" was worth the additional hike in my opinion.  Be warned, there's no shade so bring your sunscreen/hat and plenty of water."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Door Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Fun for Everyone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"With this trail, you get to actually walk on the Badlands after the boardwalk ends.

Signs mention rattlesnakes. Be aware as I'm petrified of snakes but thankfully did not see any but I stayed on the boardwalk.  My daughter and husband explored beyond the trail which means you could possibly run in to one. Very easy stroll, not much of a hike, and nearby window trail was pretty much a mirror of the door trail."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Door Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Went here for the sunset. Wanted to do the notch trail but i’m not fit enough for that so just went with the easier door/window trail. There is a boardwalk which makes it easier to go but there are trails that can go in to the inner part of the trail. It is somewhat flat and easy to navigate though they always have signs to watch for rattlesnakes.

The scenery here is quite beautiful, actually, when you drive from this point to the next overlook, you can also see some yellow mounds as well, with a red layer on top of it, then the grey white layer on the most top. It's worth to stop at this point and drive along the scenic drive to see more beautiful scenery."

The contrast between this visitor center and one at the Minuteman missile site up the road is striking. "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Ben Reifel Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Nice but small,3.0 of 5 bubbles,The visitor center at Badlands is smaller than others we  have been to.  The rangers were very helpful and there was information available.  Use the restrooms here because there are not too many other opportunities after the visitor center.  One thing they did not have was food.  There was a small restaurant in the building next door but they did not have much of a menu and we had to order and eat outside in the snow.

The rangers and other employees did a great job and were helpful and friendly.   Loads of maps and helpful information.  Don't need to stay long, but it's worth the maps and brochures to stop.  Very clean restrooms, bring your water bottle for a fill up.  Was super crowded in there the day we went, but we still were able to very quickly get the information we needed, use the restroom, fill our water bottles and head out into the park with a good plan."

This stop is on the west side of the road. There are enough parking spaces for about 20 cars and 10 RV’s. There are 2 ways to get to the walkway from the parking lot. The path requires some stairs down to the walkway out or a short sandy path to the walkway out. It is worth the effort to go to the overlook as the view is very nice. It was a nice stop with a good view of the steeper rocks in the park. Enjoy"

Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Pinnacles Overlook,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Must See Pullover,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of a handful of overlooks you have to visit on your drive through the park.  Others may be worth stopping if the sun is right or if there are animals; however, this is one you should plan to see.  It is first on the loop if you start from the west and last from the east but either way, it is probably the The highest overlook elevation you will get of the formations.  With the elevation the views are impressive and the formations as well.  We saw a sheep here resting on the top of a formation.  Take time to explore here and see all the different views.  It is a great overlook to view the Sage Creek wilderness area.  Finally, like so many places here in September the flowers are beautiful, so make this a Must See pullover."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Pinnacles Overlook,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Best sunset viewpoint,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I almost forgot to mention this overlook, yet spent more time here than any other part of loop road. We spent 3 full days in Badlands Park and as this overlook has an expansive western view, we were there for sunset all 3 nights. This overlook, while offering an exceptional view from the road i.e. pullout- you can improve the experience by walking the stairs/path to a viewpoint significantly closer. This overlook is very close to the loop entrance coming into the park from Wall SD. Aside from the great western sunset view- the horizon to the east is visible as well -so we were photographing sunset to the west-turning around to photograph moonrise in the east. As an added treat each night approximately 1 hour before sunset herds of big horn sheep approached the overlook- we saw both male and female- easy camera range."

Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Roberts Prairie Dog Town,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Entertaining Stop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love to watch prairie dogs. We first encountered them in Custer State Park, early in the morning when they were very active. They were not quite so active during our hot, mid-day visit to Roberts Prairie Dog Town, but they were no less entertaining. I love when they reach up and jump while chirping! The town is located on a large, open grassland, and there were bison grazing in the distances. It was very scenic. I highly recommend a stop."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Roberts Prairie Dog Town,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Diverse Wildlife,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stopped at Robert’s Prairie Dog Town in the western part of Badlands. We immediately noticed the prairie dogs all around poking their heads up out of the ground and squeaking to warn of approaching danger (humans in this case). Watching them run around and scavenge was very enjoyable. The extent of their colony was impressive as well! In the distance we noticed a Bison herd grazing. Then while we were watching the prairie dogs, a pronghorn antelope came by! I had never seen one in the wild! To see three species of fauna in one place like that was very remarkable! In addition, the scenery was loving with the wind blowing across the grassy plains until it met the blue sky with cirrus clouds. If you want to see prairie dogs and a good chance of other fauna, I highly recommend stopping here!"

At the time, we didn't know how many prairie dogs there are in South Dakota.  They should be the state animal!  But our granddaughter enjoyed watching them in the small area and also fed them peanuts purchased at the store there.  Altough - they seemed like they were kinda sick of peanuts since everyone there was giving them some.  They are fun to watch though and listen to when they ""talk amongst themselves"".   The store there has very reasonable prices and the owner was very nice and interesting to talk to."

Not only did we see cute little Prairie Dogs - we saw hundreds of buffalo, many of them right next to our car.  Be prepared for a drive on a gravel road.  We went in the early evening - 6 or 7pm as we had read on another Tripadvisor report that early evening is a great time to see the buffalo.  The downside - we spent so much time there we didn't have much time to hike other areas.  In hindsight, I'd save this for the last activity in the Badlands."

Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Roberts Prairie Dog Town,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Sage Creek Rim Road,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Roberts Praire Dog Town is a fitting reward for those who travel on Sage Creek Rim Road.  Most of the road is un-paved and very ridged.  It can be difficult to find a speed that feels both safe and doesn't literally rattle you to death.  We took the road based on a recommendation from a park navigation app.  You definitely wouldn't want to do it while the road is soaking wet (it was damp when I did it), but there are many more spectacular overlooks on that road and it is worth going at least as far as the prairie dogs, before you can loop back to a highway that takes you to the main entrance (re-enter) of the park from Wall, SD.  Also note, however, if you only want to see praire dogs, you will most likely also see them from the main loop road (alternative route)."

It feels like most of the trail is getting to the ladder although I’m not exactly sure if we made it to the end once on top. The ladder was fun to climb even though I have a fear of heights. I was able to walk up it more than halfway and it never felt unsafe. You can also scramble up/down a narrow dirt path to the side of the ladder if needed. I saw a couple in their 60’s who did this and said it wasn’t too bad. Once on top there are some drop offs but the ledges are fairly wide. With that said, there were a few parts were I held my 7 year old’s hand. Don’t skip this trail or Saddle Pass if you want some great views and adventure."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Notch Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Best Badland Experience, Signature NPS Hike MUST DO",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the most fun activity we did in Badlands.  The hike is both beautiful and challenging, and most importantly, the view at the end is simply incredible.   It has everything you came to see at Badlands NP.  There are some challenging spots both the ladder climb and the canyon edge but do not let these deter you.  Please note this is a signature hike in the NPS system for the ladder which is a woodrail ladder that begins gradual as simple steps before ending vertical like a ladder.  Truly it is not that bad, easier going up than down.  You then walk on the canyon ledge that adds some additional excitement to this hike.  "

Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Notch Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Fun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was a bit nervous to attempt this trail even though it’s short based on what I’d read about it previously, but it was a blast! Starts out easy enough (pretty flat), and the ladder was more of a mental thing to overcome than anything. After that, you’re walking/climbing along the actual rock formations, which was super fun. Definitely recommend wearing sturdy hiking shoes; you’ll need the extra support. The biggest obstacle in the Badlands is the heat; bring extra water, keep eating, and try to go early or later in the day. The view at the end is lovely! "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Notch Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,An Interesting Experience ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really enjoyed the park and our visit to Badlands. It is truly a unique place. We stayed at Cedar Pass Lodge. The cabin was very nice. It had been recently renovated. The only problem we encountered is that there really wasn’t any place to eat. There was a cafe but the choices were very limited. We were forced to go to the town of Interior for dinner. We went to a local bar called the Wagon Wheel Bar and Grill. It was very rustic, but the service was very friendly and the limited menu had some edible food. All in all a nice experience "

We went slowly and took our time, rested on some rocks here and there and NO REGRETS!  Loved the trail.  Younger folks (or those in better shape than me) would say this is not a terribly strenuous hike, but it was the toughest one I personally did while I was in the Black Hills.  Let me encourage you to try it!  If you can climb a ladder, you can do it!!   Loads of young folks were passing us, but we just slogged along and managed it well.  I loved this as I felt like I accomplished something (don't laugh at me young, fit people)....Views at the end are worth it and the trail itself is the coolest trail I've ever taken. "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Notch Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Overcrowded ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Was surprisingly busy for a weekday in late October. Nice that you can hike anywhere including off trail. The biggest hang up is the log ladder about half way up the trail. It is a unique feature but people were so busy trying to get multiple photos of themselves on the ladder that it really slowed up the hike. There is a way up and down next to the ladder but it is a little steep. 
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Notch Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Best Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is the best hike in BNP.  There is easy parking with a restroom before you head in.  There are other trails that start from same parking lot so be sure you see the sign for Notch before you start out.  The ladder is easy up and a bit complicated coming down for young children. We say kids of all ages going up and down.  The end is much closer than you think and worth making it to.  The trick is you cannot tell how far the end is so many people turn around about 100 yards short.     
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Notch Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Read this review to find a secret path,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Several websites said that this is the best hike in Badlands National Park, so we decide to do it. It is rated as moderate to strenuous. There is ladder that you are supposed to climb to get to the top of cliff but we couldn't really use it to get up as there was a line of people waiting to get down. Everyone should know that this ladder or climb to the top of the cliff is entirely unnecessary. You can easily walk along the dry river bed and get to the outlook. Conversely, the National Park Service could put in a set of stairs to the tops to avoid the silliness."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Badlands Wall,Geologic Formations,5.0,People need to be considerate of others,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The roads are winding and the sites are beautiful. It is one of my favorite rides in the country. What does amaze and bother me is the selfishness of the “Me” generation. The “Me” generation is not about when you were born, it’s about only caring about yourself and not thinking about what you do and how it impacts others. This is evident along the entire road of the Badlands. People think nothing of stopping in the road to take pictures, holding up the dozen vehicles behind them. If each of ten cars stops for even just 30 seconds it causes the last person in line to be stuck five minutes. Be kind, pull out of traffic when you stop. Additionally, people drive huge RVs towing trailers behind them that are not capable of maintaining the speed limit, which is low to begin with, as the road in places is steep and winding. On my ride through the park I had had the opportunity to admire the back of a large coach RV and a fifth wheel trailer for half the park. Common scenery these days in and around the Black Hills"
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Badlands Wall,Geologic Formations,5.0,Must Do the Badlands Loop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely Amazing!  We were finishing a long, several day drive & were ready to get to the hotel in Rapid City when we decided to get off the highway early & drive the Badlands Loop. The kids grumbled about adding on driving time (but we had come all this way to see the sights). One of the best decisions we have made. The views are incredible!  We got out at the 1st viewing area & all grumbles stopped instantly. Breath-taking views & scenery. The kids made us stop at most of the viewpoints & scenic overlook stops because they wanted to see what variation on the scenery was next. We saw Bighorn Sheep, Deer & American Bison on our drive. The whole thing, with multiple stops, added a couple of hours to our trip to our hotel,  but this was why we had driven all the way out here, & even the kids realized this once we got into it."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Badlands Wall,Geologic Formations,5.0,The Badlands are great! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Everyone should visit national parks and this is no exception!  It's easy to get to and if you wish (but why would you) you can just drive through it without ever leaving your car.  But if you did that you'd miss the hikes and the scenic views that you can only truly experience by getting out of your car! 
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Badlands Wall,Geologic Formations,5.0,Spell binding views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very memorable visit to Badlands NP - we visited the park after a stop over at Walls Drug. We did the badlands loop road and it took us about 2 hours including stops at quite a few vista points. The scenery is breath taking - we even managed to see a huge Buffalo, deer and pronghorn goats. There were many prairie towns with prairie dogs popping in and out of them . The first vista point  was spell binding with a gorgeous view of the  Canyon. The views only get better as we drive on. Visitor center closes at 4 pm, in case you want to stop by. We stopped at many vista points though did not go on any trails. We left the pack from"
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Badlands Wall,Geologic Formations,5.0,Nice Scenery,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice area to visit and experience while taking in the sights. Cool sights and we were there early enough in the summer that we got to check everything out without the crowds.

Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Badlands Wall,Geologic Formations,5.0,A Great Family Experience! A Marvelous Wonder of our great Country!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The first viewing area is breathtaking and sets the entire drive through the Badlands up for excitement and wonder. Our Family spent 3 hours taking in the beauty and climbing the trails for extra special views. Wear good tennis shoes or boots and the trails will be no problem for any able bodied adventurer.

Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Badlands Wall,Geologic Formations,5.0,wildlife is abound,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Saw all the wildlife they have at the park.  While we were there people respected the wildlife and respected the paths.  Beware of snake signs did come in handy as we did come across a fairly big rattle snake on one of the trails.  While some people backed off others thought they should get a closer look.
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Badlands Wall,Geologic Formations,5.0,Take some water and take the Door trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not too far north of the Ben Reifel's Visitor Center is a pulloff where you will find the Door, Window and Notch trail.  If you take the Door trail, there is a boardwalk which will take you to the other side of the wall and into the Badlands.  At the end of the boardwalk there is a trail that continues into the Badlands, marked by various numbered signs.  It doesn't take more than 30-60 minutes or so to get to the end of this trail, but it is an experience of the ""real"" badlands.  More than just driving through, this will give you a feel of experiencing this amazing landscape.  Get out of the car, make sure you have some water, and spend some time exploring."

Saw a bunch of wildlife even though it was mid-day; bison, mountain goats, hawks, prairie dogs.  There are plenty of pull-offs to take it all in.

Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Loop Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Beautiful Views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We toured Badlands last day on our way to Sioux Falls. We drove from Rapid City down highway 44 to take the scenic route instead of I-90. It brought us in the back side of the park via gravel road for 30 miles. The views were great. Saw lots of prairie dogs (none were at Roberts Prairie Dog town when we stopped) so glad we came in this back way we saw so many! Plus lots of bison roaming. This sage creek road (gravel road) connects you to the paved Loop road. We took it around to Minutemen Missile part of I-90 and headed toward Sioux Falls. We stopped at many of the overlooks and climbed rocks. We ended our trip hiking Notch Trail! 
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Loop Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Great side trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a beautiful drive! Worth a side trip off the freeway. Lots of spots to pull off and enjoy the view. Road is is good condition. It's a pleasant drive in the off-season, not sure what it's like when the summer crowds are there. $30 entrance fee applies (payable at the visitor center in the off-season). No services in the off-season. "
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Loop Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Plan a day trip...or stop on the way,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Drove 1.5 hours in order to experience the Badlands and was not disappointed.  Amazing geography, saw bighorn sheep, and amazed at the harsh beauty of the area.  A little hint - if you are traveling east to west and plan to see some of the different national parks get a pass.  Cost is $80 for a full year and with the cost of the parks anywhere from $25 to $30 this can save money in the long-run."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Loop Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Beautiful and a must-do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a must do if you are visiting the Badlands area!  There are several stops along the way to either hike or just take breathtaking photos of the landscape.  Keep your eyes out for bison, prairie dogs and bighorn sheep; you're sure to see them at some point on this drive!  We made this part of our road trip from Minneapolis to Rapid City and actually did it again on the way home because it was that cool.  There is a visitor's center along this route that is also a nice place to stop.  There is a ton of history about the area in the center as well as a gift shop and you can see people preparing fossils that have been found there.  Very cool and well worth the fee to get in both ways."
Badlands National Park,South Dakota (SD),Loop Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Gorgeous! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a mindboggling drive. Just when you're like, ""yeah, I've seen all these rocks,"" the Badlands throw you a change-up. We stopped at a lot of the overlooks, but especially liked the Prairie View at sunset. Just the two of us, the grasslands, and the sun. "

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Go to Broken Arch to beat the crowds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We thoroughly enjoyed our hike to Broken Arch and Tapestry Arch especially after seeing the chaos at the Devils Garden trailhead. We parked at Devil's Garden and walked through the campground to the trail head but you can drive into the campground and park at the trail head as well. Trail was quite sandy but otherwise flat and easy. You can do a loop through the arch that is around 2.5 miles. Be sure to stop at Tapestry arch as well. We only saw 10 other people on the trail the day we went so it was a nice relief from the chaos of the rest of Arches NP. 
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Interesting,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"An easy walk through the grassland from the Sand Dune parking lot.  Round trip is 1.5 mi, slightly further than some other easy trails to the arches. The arch shaped like a heart. The middle of the arch has a large crack, thus how the name came about."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Broken Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The almost mile long hike to Broken Arch is through a grassland area.  It is an easy walk and the view is well worth the time and effort to get there.  Once you reach the arch, the trail is more crude, so you may not want to proceed depending on your skills."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Combine with Sand Dune Arch,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"One half of an interesting hike.  Not really broken, just cracked.  Walk from Sand Dune Arch is about half mile across open (hot) plain, but you can climb up through the arch for a photo and walk around the back for another view.  "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My son and I hiked out to Broken Arch after visiting Sand Dune Arch. If you're in the area, I suggest hiking to Broken Arch first and then visiting Sand Dune after where you can cool off and get refreshed. The hike to Broken Arch was level and easy, but it was 101° when we did it so it was a bit uncomfortable. There are some beautiful views along the hike and at the arch itself. "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Less crowded - FANTASTIC - don't miss,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A few have mentioned Tapestry Arch - it's not even on all the trail maps but it's on this hike and not to be missed!  We hiked from the Devils Garden campground and went to Tapestry arch, Broken Arch and then headed back because of the wind. Tapestry was the secret gem - turned out to be one of my favorites after 2 days in the park. We were the only ones there but saw a few people arriving as we left. Highly recommend - especially to avoid the crowds of the more ""famous"" arches. Virtually no one at Broken arch too."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,"Medium Hike, Good scene",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"After visiting the Sand dune Arch, you might want to pick the trail up to Broken Arch. Its a medium hike with no difficult segments. Most people return the same way back to the parking lot, some keep moving ahead to reach devils trail head But from there the Sand Dune arch is a long way."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is accessed from the same parking lot as Sand Dune Arch.  You can see Broken Arch from the parking lot, but it is further away that it appears.  The trail is relatively flat for much of it, but does take a few small dips and rises as you near the arch.  It's a very dry, sandy trail.  "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Unique arch worth viewing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There is an easy hike to this arch.  Not crowded and worth viewing. The trail is not rocky and the footing is good.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Broken Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,There is a short hike to the arch.  It is in the open so may be hot in summer.  The trail goes right through the arch.  Beautiful.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,One of my favorites,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The short walk to the arch was like entering the world of Indiana Jones. There are lots of photo ops. Beautiful rock formations, smooth large boulders jutting from fine sandy ground. It is a  treasure hidden from the roadside view."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Sand Dune Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sand Dune Arch is a neat little arch that you cannot see from the road. It is a short walk/hike from the parking lot (most of which is through sand). Depending on the time of day you're there, once you arrive at the arch, you'll enjoy a break from the heat in the shade. Since it's an easy hike from the parking, there are lots of families and children there, which make it tricky to take a photo without anyone in it."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,"Beautiful, relaxing and oasis like",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband, two young adult sons and I visited Sand Dune Arch on a 101° day after hiking to many of the other sights there. This area was absolutely beautiful and refreshing. It felt like an oasis in the desert minus the water. I think the temperature must have dropped 30° when we entered this area. The sand was cool on my bare feet and pretty cold in one or two places. I could have stayed for hours! One of my sons said this was his favorite place in all of Arches NP. "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,"Short and easy, sandy trail through beautiful slot canyon.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Go early as with all the easy (and some of the not so easy) trails in Arches, it gets very busy by mid morning.  We got there around 7:30am and there were only a few scattered couples in and out.  Hidden gem very close to the road.  A must do."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Aptly Named Arch!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is a short hike into the aptly named Sand Dune Arch. I think I would rather hike up hills, than slog through sand in hiking boots! The area around the arch is small and crowded, which makes unobscured pictures a little difficult. Still worth doing though!"
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Too Crowded,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Probably my least favorite arch. Not overly interesting and because of its easy accessibility from the main road with a short walk from the parking lot, it was crowded including lots of children running all about. Felt like I was at a playground."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,hidden gem. must hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I don' t know how can this place only get 4 stars?? In my opinion, this is the coolest arch in the park. It is a hidden gem. When I visited the park, people all hiked in double arhes, or delicate arch. I did not plan to hike in SandDune, but I even found a parking here! Too good to not park and explore. "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,A great morning walk into a slot formation to the Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I really enjoyed my early morning walk from the visitor pull out to the Sand Dune Arch.  You have to navigate the slot in the rock formation to get there from the improved trail.  It’s a easy walk but might be a little challenging for some climbing in the narrow for access.   Try it because it’s worth it.  Young ones will love the experience hiking in then walking on the small sand dune under the arch.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,Arch in the sand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This arch is a short walk from the parking and is on sand so be prepared for that. In addition to the sand arch there are also some interesting rock formations where giant rocks are very close to each other and present interesting patterns. 
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Sand Dune Arch,Geologic Formations,4.5,A short slot (narrow) entrance into a large hall-like area with a beautiful arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the most interesting and beautiful entrance to an arch in the park.  It appeared to be a short and sweet slot (narrow) canyon upon entering, and then quickly became a large hall, with the arch off to the side.  It is a remarkable and very enjoyable sight to see.  We loved Sand Dune Arch and spent several minutes in awe."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Walk Between Towering Fins,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unfortunately, a sprained ankle and a rain shower prevented our group from hiking Park Avenue.  In many ways, Arches seems like two different parks.  You have the various arches in the back of the park and these great monoliths and towers in the front.  However, we did get to see the monoliths and towers from several of the parking lots.  I love the 3 gossips and the courthouse.  It was also great to see down the Park Avenue Trail to see how it is lined with towers on both sides to give the appearance that one is walking an urban street with skyscrapers on both sides.  Don't miss this part of the park."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Early Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We made this our first stop and hike. We did it early in our day, around 8:30, and benefited from shade most of the hike. It’s 1-mile one way. If you do a return from the 5th Avenue viewing area, there is a large step area to climb at the end. We also discovered the trail goes all the way through to the parking area by the courthouse. Starting from that point and returning back avoids the steep steps and gives you downhill on your return."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great Views at Each End of the Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Spectacular view on both sides as you walk along Park Avenue Trail. It was hard to know the best time of day to do this as the rock formations are in the shade if you go too early or too late in the day. I ended up going around 11am. The lighting was good for photography but it was also getting pretty hot. I started at the Park Ave Trailhead. I would say the best views are right at the start from the observation area. Views of the Courtland Towers are spectacular at the end of the hike although you can also experience this area by parking near them. If you can arrange for a one way hike catching a ride at the end of the hike to drive you back to the start where you left your car, this would be ideal. As a solo hiker, I was tempted to hitch a ride but lost the nerve. I'm not sure if anyone out there has experience doing this? If I were to do again, unless I could arrange the ride back, I would probably just visit both ends and walk a short ways in and back  from each trailhead as I didn't find the middle section as interesting."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,SENSATIONAL!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the first trail that I came across after entering the park. The hike is not particularly long as I clocked it at about 2.36 miles (3.8 km). It is considered easy to moderate due to some hills and changing terrain. This trail will take you past the gigantic monoliths, most notably The Three Gossips, The Courthouse Towers and The Organ just to name a few. You will also hike through canyons with amazing views. It will also follow along a smooth, multi colored wash that resembles poured cake mix. This is an out and back hike as opposed to a loop. With numerous stops for pictures and observation it was still under an hour. Take your map, bring water, if you carry it in carry it out and descending always yields to ascending!"
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Quick stop on way into park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the first stops in Arches NP is the Park Avenue Viewpoint. We did not go on a hike here because we went on hikes in other locations where there were arches. There are tall colorful rocks here worth the stop in or out of the park.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Cityscape in rock form,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Moderate hike to stroll through park avenue in the arches. Surrounded by beautiful towering rock formations easy to see how it got it’s name. A down and back trail or you can continue to another parking area. Great desert scenery all along the way.  Parking area fills up quickly during busy times. Take plenty of water, good sturdy hiking shoes, and a hat. In the hot months go early. "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Scenic and easy stroll from Courthouse Towers lot,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We enjoyed our late afternoon the Park Avenue hike. We hiked up from the Courthouse Towers lot instead of going down (and consequently back up) from the Park Avenue lot. From Courthouse Towers the hike is flat to a bit up so the return is all downhill. I was surprised to see water in pools in the slick rock. It’s a scenic and easy stroll.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Favorite short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My favorite short hike was through Park Avenue canyon, two miles round-trip. You’re surrounded by huge rock fin walls and views of Courthouse Towers, the Three Gossips and Tower of Babel."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,What a beautiful hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We primarily went to Arches National Park to see the arch formations but we really enjoyed the Park Avenue area as well. This is a 1-mile trail (each way) that starts at the Park Avenue parking area and gently descends into a canyon, following a wash and ending up by the Courthouse rock. It was easy enough for all of our kids to walk, even the 3 year old, who loved it."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Park Avenue Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Most impressive view in Arches National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you don't want to take the hike don't fail to get out of your car and make the very short walk to the observation area.  Park Avenue is, in my opinion, the greatest visual treat in the Park and pictures just do not do this justice.  The depth of the view is simply breathtaking, so don't fail to get out and see this spectacular view."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,One of my favorite hikes in the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,To me this hike is about the views along the way and not the end point.  The arches are great but I think the best part is the every changing fabulous views.  Maye of the review have already provided great advice.  The trail straight out to Double O (without all the side trails) passing by Landscape on the way is 4.2 miles and about 672 elevation gain.  My gps read more like 5.5 miles and I would guess high elevation again.  
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Made me happy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I needed another day in Moab to do the whole loop, but I had 90 minutes and did the out and back including a visit to Partition.  (It was dawn and I was pushing it.). There were a couple of steep climbs but nothing like Angels Landing.  Even with a decent breeze, I didn’t feel like it was too narrow if you are paying attention.  I’d recommend hiking boots for ankle support though.  The scenery changed as you went and left me very satisfied."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Out of this world views.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is one of the best at Arches NP. It is not for novice hikers, kids, etc. The view to & from the hike are more of the reason to make the journey than seeing the Arches themselves. Bring a backpack & more water than you think you will need."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Not Easy but the Best Hike in the Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Double O Arch is reached by a 4.2 mile (6.8k) roundtrip hike that that we felt was the best hike in Arches National Park although it requires overcoming some short steep sections, rock scrambling and traverses of rock fins with shear drop-offs on either side that will make those uncomfortable with heights nervous."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Difficult hike, avoid the Primitive Trail",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Double O Arch is 4.8 mi/6.4 km roundtrip from the Devils Garden trailhead (out and back) and should take about 2-3 hours. The trail is rated difficult because it involves hiking on slickrock and scrambling on rock fins with steep dropoffs. Alternatively, you can go on (or return via) the Primitive Trail, which is 0.9 mi/1.5 km longer than the main trail and is rated very difficult because it requires serious rock scrambling. There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, which gets full quickly."

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,The Arches Are Almost Anticlimactic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Anticlimactic now there is a word not often used for an exhilarating experience.  Before you make the decision to go on this hike also read the reviews on the Devils Garden Trailhead as this trailhead leads to the Double O Arch.  The hike here is the best part of seeing these arches.  To get to these arches you get off of the paved paths and go on what the park system calls Primitive trails.  Primitive is truly what you get here.  This is a trail that can be difficult at best and treacherous in icy conditions like we experienced.  
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,great hike but does have crowds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I loved this hike, the only thing I didn't like about it was that it is a little crowded.  This hike is more strenuous than Delicate Arch.  You will be scrambling up rocks a little bit and walking on rock fins that have very steep drop offs...but that's what makes it so awesome.  There are many other arches along the way if you want to take that detours to see them included landscape arch (no detour needed for this one), partition arch, navajo arch, and others.  If you like to hike, this is a great one."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Make sure you see it from the backside!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hike on the top of a fin to get to Double O arch is a favorite of mine!

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double O Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Do this arch at sunrise!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this arch in the morning just before sunrise. It was cool enough to walk to, and the trail was easy and short from the parking lot. When you reach the bottom of the arch, you're actually standing underneath it. And the view? Endless! Absolutely stunning. The sunrise? Phenomenal! The colors of the sky mixed with the rocks was just beautiful. Bring your camera for sure!"

Arches National Park is one of the smaller national parks so you can experience most of what you want - unless you're going to do some serious hiking or camping - in only a few hours.  Some of the famous arches are within a short walk from the driving and parking areas, while some of the others require some serious hiking to view.  We traveled here with small children so the longer-distance hiking wasn't an option, but the park was still wonderful and a place I'm glad we came to.  There is one road in and the same road out, but with a few offshoots taking you to different groupings of rock formations and arches.  In between the famous and highlighted formations is high desert area which some people have commented is ""vast nothing"" or worse; but, it's very beautiful in it's own way.  I would recommend a trip to Arches National Park to see the park itself, but also to participate in other activities around Moab including 4x4 Hummer tours, rafting, bike riding, etc.  And, the town of Moab has lots of good options for lodging, dining, shopping, etc.  It's remote, but that's also part of the experience."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Arches National Park Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,A must-do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Whether you have a limited amount of time to visit or simply want a “lay of the land” before decided on your itinerary, the Scenic Drive at Arches National Park is a worthwhile activity.  You can spend a couple hours or the better part of a day driving the 36 mi/59 km (round trip) road through Arches National Park.  With plenty of places to stop and snap pictures and innumerable panoramic views, you can enjoy the natural beaurty and majesty of Arches without having to leave your vehicle."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Arches National Park Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Spectacular Drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not long after entering the park as you climb up the road through several switchbacks, you will experience spectacular sights throughout the drive. My favorite section was driving from Park Avenue through The Courtland Towers area. Balanced Rock is beautiful especially at sunset and is about a 30 min drive from the entrance. It takes about 40-45 min to drive to the end of the scenic drive at Devil's Garden Trailhead. As beautiful the sights are along the road, the highlights of Arches National Park involved getting out and doing some hiking including to Delicate Arch, Landscape Arch and beyond to Double O Arch, Broken Arch and the Windows area."

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Arches National Park Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Spectacular Scenic Drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easily accessible just outside of Moab, the scenic drive through The Arches was a spectacular experience.  When we travelled there in late August, the park still was using a time reservation system but we were able to find many openings even at the last minute however they did turn people away who approached the entrance without a reservation. We used our senior national park pass, so there was no additional fee to enter the park. The drive was very manageable with a paved road throughout. There are many places to pull over or pull off and park so that you can take in the views and land formations. Some of the more popular areas were quite crowded and finding a parking place did require circling around a few times. Some of the formations do require significant hiking for access but others are readily available with short walks or from a distance. Restrooms are scattered throughout the park. There is a very large visitor center at the entrance. It was certainly worth the drive."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Arches National Park Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Breathtaking!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The scenic drive is the best way to see all of the beautiful arches and other sites. We arrived at the park around 6:00pm which was perfect. Most people were leaving, so the park was not crowded at all and we didn't have to wait to enter the park, in fact, it was free as there was to the back and worked our way forward which worked well for us. You can stop at how many or few areas you choose to. The drive took us about 2.5 hours with stops here and there and some short hikes. There was a surprise around each corner with another beautiful display of nature."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Arches National Park Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Great views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was an amazing drive through beautiful scenery.  We visited in January so there was snow everywhere adding to the natural beauty of the park.  Be sure to stop at the visitor center and pick up a map so you won't miss anything.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Arches National Park Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Comfortable Way to See the Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My son and I visited Arches National Park on our trip across Southern Utah.  The road through Arches National Park is an easy way to see some of the best sites without doing a lot of hiking.  We did do several hikes, but we also enjoyed the drive.  In fact as we entered the park and drove in we just kept being impressed by the views along the road.  There are pull-offs to see Delicate Arch (from a distance) and Balanced Rock and Double Arch.  It is a great drive and it is very accessible."

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Arches National Park Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Arches Park  great views but very busy in late May,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Arches is a beautiful park but be prepared for long waits for parking spaces, lots of people, and not-so-easy hikes to many arches.  We never saw the very back of the park because hikers get there about 5 am and take up all the parking spots for the day.  Parking in this park is VERY limited, which is disappointing.  The walks to the arches rate from moderate to difficult.  Don't be fooled by the hikes rated easy; the terrain can be uneven, uphill, and rocky.  2 places in the Park (such as balanced rock) have wheelchair paths which are paved."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went to the Dark Angel via the Primitive trail and looped back by the Double Arch back towards the trail head, with detours for the Navajo arch and Partition arch.  The landscape is beyond stunning, as you can see from peoples' photos. If you are on your own and on a week day, it's probably a good idea to have a GPS app, as not all the trail turns are obvious.  If you decide to take the Primitive loop I recommend you go counterclockwise, as some of the sketchier places are probably easier (or rather, safer) to go up than down - ie, take the right turn when you get to the Landscape arch.  You'll see many arches, and breath-taking formations.  An experience of a lifetime."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Gorgeous Garden,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Devil's Garden is located at the very back of the Arches scenic loop. The formations almost look like the backbone of a huge beast. The trailhead has a large parking area with restrooms. The way the light refracts off the sides of the close formations makes for great pictures.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,"I Recommend Going to Landscape Arch, but Don’t Waste Your Time on this Trail if Your Time at Arches NP is More Limited.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was actually shocked that this popular trail doesn’t have a dangerous and deadly reputation past Landscape Arch, considering the fact that there are relatively narrow slick rock fins with deadly dropoffs on either side of the trail. There’s also a lot of sand covering the rocky and steep areas of the trail to make the trail even more slippery and potentially dangerous. I  saw multiple foolish people climbing up steep fins off the trail that would be a deadly fall if those people fell. So I was surprised that I hadn’t heard about fatalities on the Devils Garden Trail. The arches on the trail are awesome. However, there are better and shorter trails in the park to see a greater concentrations of arches that are just as spectacular, if not more so. I would recommend hiking to at least to Landscape Arch. Past Landscape Arch I wouldn’t recommend the trail if your time at the park is more limited. Go elsewhere in the park to see more arches once you get to Landscape Arch if your time is kind of limited. Most importantly I would not recommend this trail at all to anyone past Landscape Arch if you’re afraid of heights."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Devil's Garden is Difficult, not Moderate and certainly not easy",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"For avid, experienced hikers in good shape and without fears of heights, Devils Garden seemed to be a hiking paradise, based on the conversations we had with people on the trail. We talked with people (most in their 20s and 30s) coming from the direction we were headed because we were either lost or concerned about the difficulty ahead. "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great Arches Quality and Quantity ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the Arches MUST SEE and hike is the Devil's Garden trail.  The Devil's Garden is a series of fins on a ridge which have eroded to create some of the best arches in the park like Landscape Arch.  However, if you are simply looking for quantity of arches, this is your place as there are some many arches of all types.  In addition it is a great hike.  There is a section as you ascend to the top portion of the trail where you climb up the ridge of a fin.  This is where our party split as some wanted to continue on while others were uncomfortable.  I kept going and was rewarded with some amazing views.  This is a great part of the park and an Arches NP Must See.  "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Devils Garden Trailhead,5.0 of 5 bubbles,On our visit to Arches National Park we arrived early to try to beat the crowds and drove straight to the back of the park to the Devils Garden Trailhead area. The large parking lot made it easy to find a spot. We had planned to hike to Delicate Arch but once we started on the primitive trail we were having so much fun that we continued to Double O Arch. On the way back we also saw Navajo and Partition Arch. We ended up spending several hours here and had lunch at the picnic area that shares the same parking lot.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,A Rewarding 6 Mile Jaunt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great way to see about 6 different arches on a round trip six mile hike.   You can get to 3 arches including (Landscape Arch) if you want a shorter 2.8 mile walk.

We walked some of the flat trail head areas of Devil’s garden. Devil’s Garden was beautiful what we saw of it.  We then had lunch in Devil’s Garden which had covered picnic areas and restrooms. This was a gorgeous area of the park"
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Thursday, February 2nd morning hike.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I arrived to the trailhead around 9:45am.  There were only a couple of vehicles in the parking lot.  There was a restroom available.  It was quite chilly when we started.  The trail surface was dry, muddy, snowy, and icy.  We wore our traction devices for part of the hike.  We do hike with trekking poles. we went straight out and kept left at the primitive trail turnoff loop to the right.  We hiked to a bit beyond the Position Arch, and Navajo Arch spurs.  At that point we came to a very high, skinny ridge.  We could not see too far along the ridge to see what faced us at the end.  So between the snow, ice, and high winds, we decided to bail on going any further, and headed back.  Then visiting the pine tree arch, and the tunnel arch, before making it back to the lot.  When we got back to the lot, there were quite a few cars.  We really had a nice time, and the arches were wonderful.  I would love to try this hike again in dry conditions."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Devils Garden Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Lots of Fun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful!! The only thing that makes this hike challenging is the heat, otherwise it's pretty chill with amazing views. We started at about 8:30 in late July and it took around 4 hours including a break for lunch. Wish we had started earlier because the last couple miles were brutally hot. Lots of scrambling, slippery slopes and tons of fun. Pack a cooler in the car for something to look forward to!"
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Landscape Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Another awesome arch to visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was pleasantly surprised on how many awesome arches there are in this park.  It is worth noting that if you don't want to take the hike to Delicate Arch, there are still many arches that are worth visiting with easy hikes.  The Landscape Arch is one of them.  As a bonus, the Landscape Arch is not crowded because most of the people hike to the Delicate Arch."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Landscape Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Landscape Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose to drive to the back of Arches National Park to the Devils Garden Trailhead area after entering early in the morning. This area has a large parking lot and we were easily able to get a spot. When we started hiking the weather was cool but it warmed up quickly as there is not much shade on the trail to Delicate Arch. The hike is relatively short, well maintained and a very popular route. You can’t get too close but it was certainly worth seeing this highlight of the park."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Landscape Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Lovely Fragile Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This arch can be viewed through a partial or full hike of the Devil's Garden Trail at the far end or Arches National Park. If you do the partial its roughly a mile in and a mile back for a two mile round trip. We hiked this in the evening and there were certainly areas of shade to go along with the stunning canyon views along the trial. Small wildlife can be seen along the trial. The trail travels through several fins which are interesting in and of themselves and little bit different from the typical rock formations in the park. There are some area of steep elevation gain but they are short. The trail itself is well groomed and wide - it is also well travelled and solace at least up to

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Landscape Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Easy stroll - Arches Must!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Landscape Arch is impressive and is well worth the mile hike from the Devil’s Garden Trailhead parking lot. It’s not really a hike just a pleasant stroll. Just take water. It’s a desert and can get hot. We elected to go to the Landscape, Pine Tree and Tunnel Arches. These are on the same easy loop. More ambitious hikers can go further on the primitive trail but we elected to wimp out."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Landscape Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Very special and worth the hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the most fragile arches in the park and as such you can't actually get to it, but the trail leads you along the sand to a perfect viewpoint where the arch is highlighted by the blue sky behind it."

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Landscape Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,Another beautiful arch — easy to get to,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Probably my second-favorite arch (following the iconic Delicate arch) in the Park. It is a lengthy slim one and very photogenic. You have to start at the Devils Garden trailhead, and is about one mile long (each way). Easy hike with little elevation change."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Landscape Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,So cool!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is my 2nd favorite site in Arches after Delicate Arch. It is so cool to see this long, narrow arch that is longer than a football field. And it's an easy hike that is not far from the Devils Garden trailhead."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Landscape Arch,Hiking Trails,4.5,More of Nature's Beauty.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This Arch is in Devil's Garden.  It is a bit longer hike than some of the other Arches.  It looks older and more weathered with a smaller arch nearby.  If you are prepared, you can hike futher past to see additional arches.  We turned around as it was our second day of hiking and scrambling and adding 2 miles to the hike wasn't appealing at the time.  We did see a deer close to the path and the scenery was breathtaking.  It is windy with sand.  A good sun hat will protect you from the sand as well as the sun."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Windows,Hiking Trails,4.5,Make Sure to Include Walking the Primitive Trail for Great Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Arrived in the early morning 30 minutes after sunrise to avoid the crowds that build here throughout the day given the easy accessibility with a short easy walk from the parking lot. Sun was still low in the sky making for cool views of North Window. What really made the experience was walking the primitive trail from just beyond South Window which loops around the back side of the arches providing outstanding views of both North And South Window especially in the early morning light and explaining why The Spectacles are a good nickname.  The primitive trail was a bit difficult to find but once on it, I could easily follow the rock cairns. I was the only one walking the trail on an early Monday morning in late August. Made the whole experience pretty special."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Windows,Hiking Trails,4.5,Excellent hike with three arches close to each other,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Windows section was one of our highlights.  The lower and upper windows along with the Turret Arch are all right next to each other.  The hikes are easy and you can visit all 3 arches and take plenty of pictures in an hour.  A must do while visiting Arches.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Windows,Hiking Trails,4.5,Easy hike with big payout,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'd recommend coming here early as the trail does get busy (and hot). It's a loop and we did it clockwise, going first to North Window. There is a bit of elevation gain and stairs, but not too difficult at all. North Window was the busiest, but people were respectful of letting you get a photo in front of it without standing in the way. I'd recommend walking up and looking through the window at an amazing view of the park."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Windows,Hiking Trails,4.5,Many great views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Windows are unique and different from the arches throughout the park. There are 3-4 trails you can take, with the trailhead at the parking lot. I definitely recommend the Primitive Trail for great views and vistas of the park. Hikes are easy to moderate. You can walk right up to the windows with a bit of rock scrambling and get some great pictures inside the windows (North Window and South Window). You will see both sides of the windows if you hike the Primitive Trail. The Double Arch is across the road so you can park once and enjoy both attractions. Make sure to wear a hat because there is no shade."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Windows,Hiking Trails,4.5,Can't miss taking the Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fabulous views from the ""Windows"" trail. Easily see a half dozen arches of various sizes. But the South Window and the North Window are the main attractions on this side of the loop trail. Be aware that there are some steps and good shoes with a decent tread are really nice to have. Some parts of the trail and steps can have a very thin ""dusting"" of loose sand that can be very slippery, so pay attention to the trail and avoid walking with your eye on your camera or phone.  It is incredibly hard  not to walk and focus on the arches and the vistas, so take your time, stop and scope out yet another amazing view... click, click"

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Windows,Hiking Trails,4.5,Two Arches within One Fin - Signature Sight,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Windows are one of the premier arches that you need to see on your visit.  They are a pair of arches in the same fin but they are some of the larger arches in the park.  The way they sit on top of a ridge in the park allows them to be seen across the park.  Additionally, the two aches side by side create the appearance that the fin is the rim for a set of glasses.  When you step away from the arches you can see what they call the Spectacles.  There is a trail that goes around the Windows and I suggest you hike this for the best view of the Spectacles.  Also take the time to walk into the arches and under them as the size of the opening is impressive here.  This is one of the arches that is a signature sight for the park and Must See."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Windows,Hiking Trails,4.5,Looking Like A Mascara,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This double treat arches are great art work of mother nature. You can see from one window arch  the Turret Arch nearby. You can take photo looking though one window within the arch. Amazing  view.

Be sure to have water and wear proper hiking shoes since the stones can become slippery."

The trail is not well marked and you will get ""lost"" for a little while many times.  It gets especially confusing in the middle of the trail, but if the way seems too difficult you are going the wrong way.  Eventually you make it out.  We were on the trail for about 3.5 hours.  There are a few challenging sections, but my not particularly brave wife made it through with only a few scares."

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Fiery Furnace,Hiking Trails,5.0,Furnace Review ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was a lucky one and got tickets into the Fiery Furnace. Apparently there is an app of the trial you can download which came in handy for a lot of folks ... NOT US!!! I didn't even know about this until someone inside was offering us help to get back on the right path. The arrows they have in some places blend in so well, it's hard to find. This is especially in the rock climbing spots. Overall we had a great time, even if we got lost a few times and had to back track. I do recommend going early because once that sun comes out, you'll know why it's called the fiery furnace. Would we do it again, YES but with the app!! "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Fiery Furnace,Hiking Trails,5.0,It's back!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Fiery Furnace is open again after a year and a half! We snagged one of the first tickers.

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Fiery Furnace,Hiking Trails,5.0,Frustrating Experience,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you enjoy getting lost, this is the trail for you.  I had researched this trail and knew it was easy to get lost, so I downloaded a guide.  The guide was great, but we still got lost.  I am not sure why the park does not put up better trail markers.  It seems they want people to get lost and frustrated.  It was pretty down there, but not worth the frustration of constantly having to retrace your steps and try to figure out where the heck you were.  There were also some physical aspects of climbing and maneuvering through the rocks that we just did not feel safe doing.  We did not make it all the way around and ended up turning around and going back the way we came in.  We wasted a good portion of our day getting the permit, watching the movie and getting the talk, and then getting lost.  I'm not sure where all of the positive reviews come from.  Everyone we encountered was lost and trying to find their way.  Not a fun way to spend your time."

There are 20 directional arrows throughout the trail.  With the exception of ONE arrow, the signage is enough to successfully navigate the trail.  #11, the sole arrow that is diagonal, indicates the trail veers left when actually it veers right. Cross the rocks and you will see on the right, “steps” in the rock.  "
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Fiery Furnace,Hiking Trails,5.0,Stop at all overlooks,4.0 of 5 bubbles,All of Arches NP has awesome scenery every where you turn. The story boards are informative.

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,Too many people!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This arch is very cool, but it is an absolute zoo of people to see.  Because it is visible from the road and a short walk over essentially a paved path, it's very popular (as are the nearby Double Window Arches and the Turret Arch).  If you are able to, skip this and hike to some of the more remote arches and avoid the families with wagons full of kids slogging along the path."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Short, easy trail with an excellent payoff",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This short (0.5 mi/0.8 km) out-and-back trail features one of the most impressive formations in Arches National Park, the famous “Double Arch.”  To reach the trailhead, take the Windows Road off the main Arches Scenic Drive (the turnoff is near Balanced Rock) to the end of the road, which takes you directly into the parking area for the Windows Loop Trail.  You can either park there or continue a little further to the parking area right in front of the Double Arch trailhead."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,Easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Double Arch is unreal. It is massive and breathtaking, especially with the clear blue sky in the windows of the arches. You can climb directly into the lower arch if you are brave enough (there is a sheer drop on the other side!) The hike up to the arch is easy, then once you get to the arch you can do some rock scrambling to go higher. In the middle of the day (noon-ish) there were a lot of people around and it was crowded. It was also very hot as the heat reflected off the stone. You will definitely need a hat and sunglasses when making the short hike from the parking lot to the arch. Nonetheless, it is an impressive site to see!"
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,Another Arches Must-See,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A favorite in Arches NP - if you are able to get a parking spot, keep it and hike it. On one side is the amazing Double Arches and on the other the Windows and Turret Arch. Keep hydrated and wear proper shoes! There are restrooms near the parking area as needed. The Double Arch is one of the most spectacular works of nature that I've ever seen. You can climb up higher into the Arch, if you wish, but I opted to sit in the shade for a tad since it was ""spicy"" out, as my kid would say."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,Double Arch is Double Fun !!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We felt this area of Arches National Park was the most special.  They call this the Windows area and there are plenty of windows of large and small windows that show the various arches.  The double arch is so surreal and you get to walk right up to it and actually climb in it.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing Arch - Signature Sight MUST SEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the miracle Must See Arches within the park.  This formation is so unique with multiple arches and it is made for pictures.  It is a short walk from the Windows so one stop in the parking lot can net you two of the best sights in the park.  I will say Double Arch is better and more amazing, but you need to see the Windows.  It is truly great that they are right next to each and easily seen from one parking space.  Additionally the parking lot between the two attractions has a restroom that was also a big hit with our group.  Be sure to make time to see this amazing Arch and you will be rewarded."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best Spot in the Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"To me, this was the best assortment of rock formations all accessible from one parking lot.  Get here early to avoid the crowds, as parking is limited although it's a larger lot than other locations.  It's known for glowing at sunset, but the sunrise is equally amazing and peaceful.  If you're into photography, the shadows cast as sunrise are spectacular.  And look for a knob of rock on your left as you walk back to the parking lot from Double Arch.

It is a short , mostly flat walk to the arches but still a very hot one so be prepared with water. It is is an amazing experience getting up close to these arches and being able to climb it."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Nice, easy climb to pretty double arch.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Pretty view.  Half mile hike if you start in the second parking lot.  If you park in the first lot (upper lot but first one you come to on one way road in) you are closer to the windows hike.  We did what you should do in this very busy park and took the first spot we saw, which was in the first lot.  Since it was rainy, we decided to skip the one mile hike to the windows and instead, climbed down the steps to the lower second lot to the trailhead to the double arch.  Lots of folks climbed into and all over the arches but we had a great view for photos at the end of the dirt path and did not venture further in the rain on the wet rocky path leading to under the arches."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Double Arch,Hiking Trails,5.0,A Beautiful Arch and a Simple Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My son and I hiked the easy trail to Double Arch.  The hike is pretty and the area at the base of the Arch is wonderful to explore.  Of course the Double Arch is one of the most famous in the park.  This is really easy and worth doing.  It is also worthwhile to just find a place to sit and look at the Arches.  If you hurry through every arch to see everything you miss the opportunity to real admire the beauty of the place. I recommend a visit to Double Arch.

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Delicate Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,world famous view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Worth every second of the hike!   Its just over 3 miles round trip to get from parking lot to Delicate Arch.   We did it in late June (its HOT) with 3 adults and 5 kids (ages 11 - 4).  It is strenuous in parts and there is safety issues for small kids so just be alert (no guardrails or safety railings).   We did the short viewpoint trail at night for sunset, then did the trail that takes you all the way to the top the next morning.   Both were fantastic!"

Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Delicate Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Arrive Early!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Me and my husband are in our late 50’s and not avid hikers but in decent shape.  We were told by multiple people that we MUST hike up to Delicate Arch.  I was a bit nervous since it is classified as a difficult hike but we decided to go for it and so glad we did.  The hike is pretty steep in a few places but on solid ground so I felt safe.  The views are spectacular.  I would highly recommend going early in the morning to avoid the crowds and the heat.  Be sure to bring a hat and water.  We arrived at the parking area at the base at 6:30 a.m.  It was still dark so we waited about 15 minutes until there was enough light to see and started up.  There were several people ahead of us that had already started up wearing headlamps and in restrospect I wish we had done the same since it took us about 45 minutes to make it to the top.  We stayed on top for about an hour and started back down and it was amazing how many people were hiking up (it was MUCH more crowded).   We enjoyed the hike back down since it was lighter and we could see some things we missed on the way up, including 4 mule deer!  We stayed another couple of hours within the park and then left to find the gates were closed because the park was full.  Therefore, be sure to arrive early, preferably before 9 am."
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Delicate Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Incredible,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Delicate Arch is Incredible. The hike is not easy as expected and a proper footwear and GPS or navigation would help a lot. We lost at night without a GPS and would recommend to hike only during daytime if you’re not the adventurous type of not worrying about getting lost. During summers it’s very hot and plan to hike for an hour with water before sunset for incredible views.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Delicate Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Delicate Arch,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Our family chose to hike to Delicate Arch later in the day to capture good pictures of the setting sun on the parks iconic arch. We arrived around 4:30 pm on a Sunday and there were still plenty of spots in the parking lot. On the way to the arch we walked over to view the petroglyphs which adds very little time to the hike. A good thing about the hike is that you can see most of the trail. It is a long gradual uphill trek with a large portion taking place on rock. There is no shade so it can certainly get hot. It took us about 45 minutes to get there but seeing Delicate Arch was certainly worth it. Don’t expect to be the only one there as there was a constant line of people in front of the arch to have their pictures taken. Many people stuck around the bowl area to see the sun set. This made the weather much more comfortable. We chose to return shortly after the sun set and the walk back is much easier since it’s almost entirely downhill. Although it wasn’t always easy we enjoyed this hike and are thankful we did it.
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Delicate Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Best hike ever!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I absolutely loved this hike and the delicate arch. It was moderately challenging, but, so so worth it!! Only 1.5 miles and yes, you hike up slick rock, but of dry, it’s really not slippery and just so cool to hike up the rock face. I’m afraid of heights and was not afraid on this hike. There is one area you hike along a cliff area but it was wide enough and was ok! And, the end, you round a corner and see this most amazing thing!! We went on a Wednesday afternoon in early October. It was hot, so take a lot of water and sunscreen. But, we were able to walk under the arch without a big line of people and I suspect it was busy this October because of the pandemic. But, if you wonder if you should do this, the answer is yes"
Arches National Park,Utah (UT),Delicate Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Spectacular at Sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hiked out to Delicate Arch for sunset and it was amazing. The setting is spectacular and well worth the effort of getting there. Left about 2 hours before sunset. Plenty of parking still available on a Sunday evening at the end of August. The hike is indeed quite strenuous and took a little over an hour. Stiff uphill climb much of it over slick rock. Walking along ledge at the end of hike wasn't too bad. Bring lots of water! Even at this hour it was over 90 degrees F and absolutely no shade the entire way. Able to get all the photos I needed. Lots of people there at sunset but not an overwhelming number during these Covid times and at this time of year. Plenty of room to spread out. My best photos were about 30 min before sunset creating a cool orange glow on the arch so don't wait until the last minute to get up there. I left 5 min before sunset as the Arch was already shaded and the views on the hike down were spectacular as well. No problem hiking down at twilight which lasted for 30-40 min after leaving.

There is a moderate 3 mile out-and-back hike, at elevation, mostly exposed to the elements - very warm wind when we went (Nov '20).   Understandably the 'star' of this amazing National Park."

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,Coming back to the old friend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"On a sunny morning we drove to the Bubbles trailhead parking to do our favorite hike combo: Bubble Rock, South Bubble, North Bubble. To our pleasant surprise, the rocks were completely dry and there was hardly any trace of the yesterday’s rain. We had done this hike countless times in the past and hiking it again was like meeting an old friend after years of separation. I cannot describe the views properly, so I will post my pictures and you will see the Acadia magic yourselves. The ocean, the islands, the mountains, the woods, Jordan Pond were in their full spring glory on a bright warm and sunny day. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,Really nice hike with awesome view hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very easy hike. We went to south bubble rock first. The view on Jordan Pond was spectacular even on a foggy day. After that we decided to try north bubble hike. It was more difficult but too crazy. If you go there don’t go back. Keep going on the trail. You going to get to the cliffs with a view on Eagle Lake. We went about one mile and came back. We had really good time.
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,Glacial Erratic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked up to the Bubbles from Jordan Pond Path with our dog.  The Bubbles Trail leads from Jordan Pond Path at the northeast end of the lake to South Bubble and then North Bubble.  The section between Jordan Pond and South Bubble has a few difficult sections, especially for a dog.  Alex had quite a bit of trouble at the Fat Man's Squeeze, but eventually got up.  He was very proud of himself for getting up to the top.  Bubbles Divide Trail is an easier route to access the Bubbles.  Bubble Rock, a glacial erratic that seems to be balanced on a cliff edge is near the summit of South Bubble.  Both mountains have views towards Jordan Pond from above.  Overall, a great hike, but keep in mind the route for Jordan Path is difficult."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,"For new hikers, stick to Bubbles Divide or the parking lot",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are a few trails that lead to Bubble Rock. Despite having a map, we accidentally took our dogs up a very rocky/steep one and when we finally got to the top, there was a ladder rung that we could not get past. So we hiked all the way back down and took Bubbles Divide instead (still challenging but doable). If you are a novice hiker or have young kids, I would definitely recommend starting at the Bubbles parking lot for an even gentler hike."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,North Bubble and South Bubble VIEW - but the rock...who cares....,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked up to south bubble and saw the large boulder. I was unimpressed.  However, as you continue past the rock to the overlook it was a great view of Jordan Pond.  North Bubble had an even better view and less people - don't skip it!"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,South Bubble trail is easier ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got to the Bubble rock parking around 830am and got the last parking lot on a Thursday . We did the South Bubble trail which is easier as I read from Pinterest blogs and did the same trail to return to the parking. The Bubble rock is unique and wondering how this gigantic Boulder just sit there 🤔 . After further hiking,  it reached the South Bubble trail summit with the marvelous Jordan pond view. We saw hikers came up from the Jordan pond and learned that there is more rock scrambling from the other Bubble trail. We told them the South Bubble is easier and they were relieved and glad to hike down from there😊."

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,Love the Bubbles,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The rock is cool to see, but hiking both the South and especially the North Bubble are some of the best hikes in the park.   Stunning views, moderately challenging terrain.  Do it early - the parking lot is small and is full by 8am;  and you don’t want to be there with huge crowds"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,One Hike First Timer Should Make Even for Those with Vertigo,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I believe the round trip is about 1.5 miles from the parking lot to and from Bubble Rock.  The real problem with Bubble trails - both North and South - is the parking lot.  Not many parking spaces at the trail head on the Park Loop Road at any time.  There are plenty of parking spaces around Jordan Pond, but if you start your hike from there, it would be a longer hike.  It is lovely around the Jordan Pond trail then hiking up to the Bubble Rock. If you're not pressured for time, I recommend this route.  Bubble Rock should be the first hike up for the first time visitors.  Even if you have a fear of heights, this trail would be fine.  We're casual hikers and we thoroughly enjoyed the hike."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Bubble Rock,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great hike and views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this as part of a loop hike.  We started at Jordan Pond House, hiked across the Jordan Cliffs Trail, then down to the Jordan Pond Path, then up one side of Bubble to Balance Rock, down the other side, then a nice easy walk on the Jordan Pond Path back to the start - about 5 miles and less than 4 hours.  It was our favorite hike in the park.   There are great views on top of Bubble and the balance rock is definitely neat to see.  The hike up is steep either side, but not too long; it is a bit of a boulder field, so it's uneven and slow.  One side involves some hand rungs and pulling yourself up, but nothing difficult."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Sand Beach,Beaches,4.5,"nice beach, cold water",5.0 of 5 bubbles,We got to the parking lot about 45ish minutes after sunrise (we had done sunrise on cadillac mountain then came directly here) there were 5 or so cars in the lot at the time.  We crossed the road and hiked the beehive trail.  When we got back (2ish hours) the lot was FULL.  The kids really wanted to swim in the ocean so we used the semi nice changing rooms (there are no lights on them and it was cloudy day so they were a little dark inside) to change and let them try to swim.  Even in late July that water was still COLD (like 60 F tops).  Kids enjoys splashing around and playing in the sand.  Beach was fairly quiet with only 10 or so other groups out there.    Personally unless you really like swimming in cold water I wouldn't bother to change to enjoy the beach.   Flushable bathrooms at this location as well.
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Sand Beach,Beaches,4.5,Waters reminiscent of the Carribean,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sand Beach is definitely worth a stop as you're making your way around the Park Loop Road in Acadia National Park.  First, this is one of the few places on Mount Desert Island that actually has a sandy (as opposed to rocky) beach.  The water is beautiful with shades of blue and green that are reminiscent of the Caribbean.   However, the water is cold with temperatures around 55 degrees Fahrenheit even in August.  You can stay and sunbathe if you choose or just admire the view before beginning the Ocean Path."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Sand Beach,Beaches,4.5,Small cute beach,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sand Beach is a geologic rarity, as the sign says at the stairs. The beach is flanked by rocks and trees adding to its character. On a summer day with cool breeze, it was really crowded with young and old alike. The water is cold as I read, and it is not the right spot for long periods of swimming. There are lots of parking spaces, but the place is so busy that street parking is very common. Shower facilities are also available."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Sand Beach,Beaches,4.5,first major stops along Park Loop road,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started our park loop road at 830 in the morning to avoid crowds and it was our first stop. Sand Beach is one of the first major stops along Park Loop Road. This is a scenic beach that is known for its white-sand shoreline and turquoise water. what a clean, soothing, and beautiful beach it is. fall color, hills in the backdrop of turquoise water making it so photogenic.

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Sand Beach,Beaches,4.5,Get an early start,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sand Beach was definitely one of the more popular areas of the park  In its defense, it is a beach and many folks don't have beaches.  I'm from FL so we many wanted to see it as part of Acadia, photograph it and see the scenery.  It took us about 3 times on various days to find a parking spot.  We were there briefly, but walked down to the beach and it is quite lovely due to the sharp cliffs and rocks that outline this beach.  There were adults and children doing their best to get into this icy water, but not the case for us from the warm water state.  It's a beautiful, large, wide beach and we could see why so many come here to spend the day ""on the beach."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Sand Beach,Beaches,4.5,The only sand beach in Acadia,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived here about mid-day, had to park/walk about 1 mile each way to get to the beach, but it was worth it. It's crowded, but it's big enough to find space away from others.  The beach is sandy, with beautiful glistening water and rocks/mountains around it.  The water is freezing!  I barely put my feet in.  There are also bathroom facilities and a water bottle refill station."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Sand Beach,Beaches,4.5,Small cove with sandy beach,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a pretty little sandy beach, but it was also one of the two most crowded stops (Thunder Hole being the other) at 3:15pm on a June weekday.  We were fortunate to get a parking space in the upper lot as someone left.  Unless you want to swim, if parking is difficult you should just move on and skip this stop in favor of better views such as Otter Point.  Maybe come back early in the morning or very late in the afternoon when it is less crowded."

We also went there at night to attend a ranger-led program which is taking about the stars.  It may be a good place to see stars at night if the sky is clear. Sand beach is also the starting point of Great Head trail."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Sand Beach,Beaches,4.5,Come here for cooling off in the day and stargazing at night!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We came here a few times. Parking is limited in the lot, but street parking along Park Loop Road makes it easy to access even at high use times."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Great Head Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Should be warnings ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I think most people do the small loop from Sand Beach because we did the entire larger loop starting in the parking lot right outside the park before sand beach. This trail is gorgeous with spectacular views. It starts easy then gradually gets a little steeper going up some rocky steps which were pretty easy. At the topnit us pure rock and beautiful! As you start to go down and around the loop it is pretty much all rock and very steep boulders down so much of the trail is rock scrambling. There is also quite a bit of mud due to recent rains. Just be prepared because we saw many with little babies, toddlers and some elderly people that were not happy the trail reviews say easy. I do not know if there are ways to avoid that part of the trail however there should be warnings to make sure people wear appropriate shoes and are prepared for the hike.  "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Great Head Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great hike but watch your route ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love hiking and I would say we are somewhat experienced hikers. There are two routes you can take. One is super easy and flat to great head. If you want to do a full loop though, it is a pretty challenging hike up or down on the blue trail. The views are completely worth it, just be prepared with good shoes. The NPS should label the challenging part of the hike a bit better."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Great Head Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Fun hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our family really enjoyed this hike. The trailhead is at the far end of Sand Beach.

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Great Head Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Hiking Acadia National Park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The drive up Cadillac Mt. was worth the fee to go. The views are spectacular. The trails on the rocks are gentle, even for 65+ yr. old hikers such as my husband and me. We tried to hike Jordan Pond the day we arrived. Too crowded, no place to park. We went back 2 days later and went early in the morning so we could park. Barring that, go to visitor center and take the bus. Jordan Pond was my favorite hike. Level, flat rocks, boardwalk and gravel. Views were awesome. I walked at a pretty good clip, it took me about 1- 1/2 hrs to complete. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Great Head Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Amazing Views of Acadia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Park Loop Road was busy so we decided to park off Schooner Head road which was a great choice.

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Great Head Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Beautiful views....must do this one!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Great Head Trail is magnificent.  Scrambling up the pink granite rock is well worth the effort to  enjoy the vistas and the topographically interesting trail.  We went with our 6yr old and our 13 yr old and never heard a complaint about being tired, despite it being a more physical challenge than other hikes in the park.  We went in the evening, and the lighting at this time was beautiful, plus no one else was on the trail.  The sun didn't set until 8:15 so we had plenty of time to enjoy.  The views of Otter Point are wonderful, as is the view of Frenchman's Bay and the Schoodic Peninsula.  If you only have time to do one hike in Acadia, let it be this one!"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Great Head Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,A worthwhile hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the Great Head Trail and found it to be challenging (we are fairly new to hiking) and well worth it!  The sites of the Sand Beach and the Harbors are gorgeous.  Its a moderate level hike so make sure you have the appropriate shoes (many people stumble onto the trail from the beach and think they can hike it in their flip flops).  The hike is for kids over 10 and people who are in fairly good shape.  Its not for small children, though as the rocks that you climb will take a bit of effort.  There are plenty of places to sit and look out over the ocean while you eat a packed lunch."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Precipice Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Here’s your Adrenaline Rush,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was extremely excited to do this trail because of the difficulty level. Certainly lived up to it. This is quite the adrenaline rush. Partner and I are both hikers, in fit shape and we were able to do this easily but it was not without some sweat and fear creeping in here and there. We did this hike after a downpour of rain. We waited for the rain to subside and then proceeded along. I don’t recommend doing the trail during it immediately following a downpour. Well, some spots were slippery and rungs were also nonexistent in certain areas so that was  somewhat scary. Amazing experience and would do it again. Saw some folks turning back once they saw the rungs. I would caution not to attempt if you have serious fear of heights, 0 hiking experience or does not have even basic climbing skills. If you are out of shape, you will certainly have great difficulty as well. Lots of lifting your body up using the rungs so certainly be aware of this. Lots of other amazing trails in Arcadia that you can experience. Cheers, be safe and enjoy!"

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Precipice Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"This is a climbing trail, not a hiking trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a hiking trail. It is a non-technical climbing trail. That means, while you don’t need ropes and such to climb, you will be climbing almost the entire time.  There is no stretch of flat ground to walk on, you are always climbing over rocks, boulders, and or ladders. In many places you need to pull yourself up over rocks. There are helpful handholds in some places. In some places the handholds are required, i.e, you can’t get up without them. If you have a fear of heights, have knee or balance issues, or can’t do some serious climbing this is not the trail for you. This is also not a trail for young kids. You may want to wear pants or you may scrape your knees or legs as in some cases you need to climb with knees first and you’ll need a good pair of shoes with a good grip as in some places, the granite can be a bit smooth. Also, you need patience, as the trail is narrow, you can’t really pass and when we were there, we saw a few people who really shouldn’t have been on that trail, causing a huge hold up for everyone else. We came down a different trail then switched back to this one which was a huge mistake as we had to wait for the crowd going up. Also watch out for snakes. We saw one and it didn’t feel great to be forced to place your hands (to pull yourself up) in the same area where the snake had disappeared.  But, with all those comments over, if you aren’t afraid of heights, have good balance and good knees and arm strength, this was a very fun trail to climb. I’d definitely do it again."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Precipice Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Challenging hike, but so fun!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Challenging hike, but so worth it! You need to be in good shape, wear good shoes and I recommend gloves too. Take your time so as to not make a careless mistake that could end in injury. Focus on what you are doing, and not how you could easily fall. The metal bars along the way are a big help. The trail is overall very well done, could use a little help in deciphering which way to get down. We ended up having to walk along park loop road for a while."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Precipice Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Tackling my fear of heights,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was terrified to do this trail before I began. I would say I am oderately afraid of heights, far more than my hiking buddies who seemed unphased.  I talked myself up and worked up the courage and I am glad that I did. The initial portion of the trail is bouldering, then you climb about 0.6 miles up the mountain on a combination of iron ladders and rungs secured into the mountain to reach the summit. At the summit the views are breathtaking! When you are mid climb you feel very safe. I am afraid of heights, but the level of detail and intentionality put into the ladders and iron handlebars made me feel very safe.  At no point did I feel like my life was at risk. Was I super afraid before doing this trail that I almost pooped my pants? yes.  Now that I’ve done it and experienced it, Would I do this trail again?  absolutely!!  "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Precipice Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Don't let the weather scare you off,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Another Acadia ""must do"" if you are in shape. We went up Precipice to Champlain, then over to Gorham Mountain and exited to the South of Thunder Hole. We walked back via Ocean Path Trail and stopped at Thunder Hole. It was a long route but was mostly a descent after Champlain so was fairly easy. We started at 7:45 on a cloudy, foggy morning and had the trail almost to ourselves. Reached the summit fairly quickly, stopped for breakfast and within 30 minutes the fog had burned off and we were rewarded with spectacular views. So don't let the weather scare you off."

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Precipice Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Hard, dangerous and not for younger kids.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was harder and more dangerous than expected.  I took my 9 year old son who is very capable and a somewhat experienced hiker.  I had to give him two or three boosts.  In hindsight, I would've waited until he was probably 12 years old.  I recommend this hike, but it is no joke and you have to be capable."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Rewarding views at the top of this summit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started with Beehive at 7am and did Gorham Mountain Trail thereafter, followed by Ocean Path, Thunder Hole, Sand Beach and the full loop around Great Head Trail. The views on this particular trail were beautiful of the ocean. Oh my goodness, pinch me! We parked our rental car in the Sand Beach parking lot. Found restrooms throughout, good signage and all around really enjoyable with an early morning start. Gorham isn’t an easy trail, but reasonable for a family. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Gorgeous as always,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of my favorites in the park… It is our usual afternoon hike on the arrival day because it is not difficult, rather short, and offers stunning ocean views. Another advantage is that it is a coastal trail, so mosquitoes are not too oppressive (they are going wild in the woods at the end of May and June). In the afternoon, it is easier to find parking at Sand Beach and go to the trailhead (when you cross Park Loop Road, you will see the signing post)."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,beautiful views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail was well marked and not too difficult. We took the quarry path down to start our hike and enjoyed a nice view of the water before getting onto the gorham mountain trail proper. We were hiking probably by 9:30 or 10:00 and it was already pretty busy. There's a lot of rock scrambling, and I definitely wouldn't have been comfortable coming down from the peak without hiking shoes. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Nice easy hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Less crowded than some of the more popular trails, but still go early - the parking lot can fill up by 8am.  The views are different at the faux summit and the true summit - make sure to do both.  Not a strenuous hike by any means.  A fairly easy hike, over granite and through forests.  The views of Sand Beach, Otter Cliffs, the Atlantic, and the surrounding mountains are stunning."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Very difficult if you have mobility/stamina issues,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked this trail with my husband and 2 daughters (41 & 20). My husband had asked at the visitors center for a easy hike since I have a disability and due to past medical issues I have not hiked in a while. That being said, this hike was recommended yet it was extremely difficult for me (thank goodness I had trekking sticks).  There are a lot, I mean a lot, of climbing over rocks. And then climbing down rocks. There is no flat places to hike. The views are spectacular and the scenery magical but I was so stressed by trying to complete the hike it was difficult to truly enjoy the journey. My husband had the stressful task of making sure I didn’t fall (I have balance issues and vertigo).  My 20 y/o daughter had no trouble as she was hoping over the boulders. My 41 y/o completed it without to much trouble. Bring extra water and be sure to use sunscreen even though much of the trail is shady. My daughter got a bit of a burn. I rated it a 3, not because of the views and scenery, but because it is a difficult hike if you have some medical/stamina issues."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Solid Location, Moderate Hike",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"My suggestion for reaching Gorham Mountain Trail is to take the FREE Island Explorer to Sand Beach. From there, walk Ocean Path to reach Gorham Mtn Trail. If you take the Gorham Mtn Loop (to the parking lot/ bus stop) it will be about 3.5 miles and take 2-3 hours. This is a moderately challenging climb up but not at all scary or treacherous. The views are nice at the top. If you combine Gorham Mountain Trail with either Ocean Path or the Beehive, you will have a full day’s hike."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Large flat mountain top with great views in all directions,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We would suggest combining a hike up The Beehive (ladders), then over to Gorham Mountain, and Cadillac Cliffs Trail, then back up to your parking spot via the Ocean Trail. The views from the top of Gorham Mountain (525') are lovely. There is some rock/boulder scrambling, but overall the Gorham Trail is moderate."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Sunrise Hike—HIGHLY worth it, not busy",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this as a sunrise hike. The trail was about a mile, and as such only took about a half an hour to reach the summit. Not too hard to do comfortably in the dark. Stop at the false summit to watch the sunrise, since the peak is covered in trees. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Family Favorite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorham Mountain is not among Acadia's most strenuous trails, but it's a wonderful warm up. Great views, and interesting terrain (especially on the Cadillac Cliffs split). Beware that arriving early may be advisable, as parking can be a challenge. For more experienced hikers, Gorham can also be combined with an ascent of the Beehive and/or a hike up the South Ridge of Champlain Mountain, which has wonderful views and passes the Bowl, an excellent place for a mid-day swim."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Gorham Mountain Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Nice hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this as a loop - we parked along the road, walked up Ocean Path to the trailhead, up over the mountain, down the Bowl trail back to the road, then walked the Ocean Path back to the car.  It took less than two hours for 3.5 miles.  It was a relatively easy hike, not too rocky or steep.  There were great views off both sides of the mountain.  There were a fair number of people hiking this.  It was a nice hike."

They are a classic way to see Acadia."

I'd been wanting to bike the carriage roads but after listening to a park ranger, decided to go with the least elevated road which led to Witch Hole Pond.

We were not expecting the elevation changes. All four of us (52, 52, 20, 16) are pretty active, but the multiple uphills kind of wore us out.

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Carriage Roads,Biking Trails,4.5,Witch Hole loop bike ride,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you’re walking this trail would be “easy” however as a biker it was challenging, and I ride an indoor bike regularly. We rented bikes from Bar Harbor Bike Shop and rode to the carriage trails from the West St Extension (very tough hill!). We did the Witch Hole loop starting at Duck Brook Bridge. After you cross Duck Brook Bridge and arrive at the carriage trails, follow the sign to the left and follow signs to Witch Hole. We rode it clockwise which was definitely the best way to go. There is was a moderate uphill at the start, then a very steep hill at Paradise Hill, then a moderate uphill back to Duck Brook Bridge. If you take the right at the bridge and go counterclockwise then almost entire loop is a uphill. The paths were nice and wide, with plenty of space to pass. Paradise Hill is brutal but has a nice view of the water. I think I wasn’t totally prepared for how how this would be, not an easy ride. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Carriage Roads,Biking Trails,4.5,Great way to see Acadia,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Took a ranger lead morning bike tour on part of the carriage road system in Acadia National Park. Learned the history of Acadia National Park and why the carriage roads were built.  Not a strenuous bike ride, but you must be sure you are in good enough shape to partake in the tour. You have the option to keep the bike for the entire day (which we did not know until ahead of time) and return to the store that rents the bikes in Bar Harbor. Had we known this, we would have planned to accordingly."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Bee Hive Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I recommend that those that want to challenge their fear of heights, or those that have no fear of heights, try the Beehive Trail.  It's really not unsafe, but it will challenge you if you let it.  You will be rewarded with some pretty views.  I recommend patience, because you will run into a lot of people who are having a lot of different reactions to the trail: from youthful exuberance to downright tears.  Just don't rush anyone who is taking their time, and don't clog the trail taking a selfie on the edge, it holds everyone up."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Hike with our tweens,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a really fun hike with fantastic views. Our 10  & 12 year old girls loved it.  There were parts were they were nervous due the highest and the reach they had for the rungs but overall they enjoyed.  I probably wouldn't take anyone under 10. Not because they wouldn't enjoy the adventure but because the reach needed on the metal rungs could be too challenging.   We went around 10am and there was a pretty big crowd ahead of us so it isn't a fast hike as people need to take their time.   There is no turning around once you start, so you need to be committed.  If part of your group doesn't want to do, you can take the easy way up ( the bowl trail) and meet others at the top.   And ps- I wouldn't do with sneakers if your treads are not good!   Have fun!"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Scenic Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you take the Beehive Trail, be prepared to climb iron rings and maneuver yourself well. This hike is heavy on rock-climbing and, in some areas, is narrow and high up. Would not bring children and dogs up this route. However, you can still reach the top of Champlain Mountain via the Bowl trail, which is much easier (and is the way down if you take Beehive up). "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Hike with 10yr old,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiked the beehive this morning with my 10yr old daughter. She scampered up it with no problems. We made her wear my wife’s sneakers as they had better grip than her own. She loved it as it was the most challenging and rewarding hike she had done. I found the hike easy. I would have preferred to have hiking boots or sturdy walking shoes, but didn’t have them with me. So did it in my running shoes, which are lightweight with good grip and cushioning, but allow a lot of sideways movement. I didn’t roll an ankle but had a couple of moments when I thought I might!"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Great hike, stunning views",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We’ve hiked quite a few trails during our stay in Acadia and this one was by far the most scenic. The only thing I’d do differently is to go much, MUCH earlier to avoid a ton of people going at the same time. There was literally ‘traffic’ jam - having to wait for people to go up. The views were amazing. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Who should climb ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is beautiful trail which requires one to climb  few, just a few metal rungs. But only 3 at a time. However, experienced climbers who were in front of me didn’t need them. A very short climb to the top. I wouldn’t take a five year old, but an athletic 10 year old can easily manage. Even I “jogged” to the top with ease. If you’re an adult, make sure you don’t have bad knees or shoulders. I did the hike with a sprained knee ligament and it didn’t act up and my sister in law climbed it with a compromised shoulder. So don’t fear this hike. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Don't be scared!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a fun trail! The trailhead is right across the street from the Sand Beach parking lot. We went on a semi-crowded late morning/early afternoon and had to park a little ways down on the main road- it's a busy place! Wear sturdy hiking shoes and make sure you bring water. It's not a long hike at all, but you will exert a lot of energy."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Beehive is a climing trail, not a hiking trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a hiking trail. It is a non-technical climbing trail. There is almost no place where you will walk on a straight path. The beginning of the trail starts with stepping from rock to rock.  You’ll need good shoes with a good grip, as the rocks can be slippery.  I saw one person go down and it seems she really banged her knee on one of the rocks.  Once you pass that section, you climb over large rocks and in some places are near the edge of the cliff (with handholds on the side of the cliff). It is definitely not a climb for those with a fear of heights or balance issues. It is also not a climb for young kids. You come down a different way- which is easier and you end up at a very pretty, scenic lake.  (Note: There are other trails that can get you to that lake as well.)  With all that said, all in all, we enjoyed climbing this trail and would do it again."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Great fun, if not backed up...",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was super fun the 2nd time.  The first time was stuck waiting on a ledge for 20 mins for people ahead of us who'd frozen from fear.  We finally turned around before  and went back, which is not allowed.  Seriously, if you are scared of heights, this is not for you.  You really can fall to your death (probably won't) and even if you make it after massive delays because of fear, you've spoiled it for those behind you.  Of course, it's scary at points and of course it slows down as people are careful... but if this stuff freaks you out, don't do it.  It's a great experience when it flows.  The 2nd time I did it (at 5 pm) it was a blast... about 20 mins to the top, then the hike down the trail."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Champlain Mountain & Beehive Loop Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"OK for brave beginners, but wear real hiking shoes!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I did this trail during Labor Day weekend with a group of friends and all of us enjoyed it a lot. The views along the way are definitely amazing. Maybe you’ll be a little scared of the height, but trust me, the view of the ocean and all those trees is worth it. We are not professional hikers, so this trail was a little challenging. We weren’t used to climbing on iron rungs like we had to. Sometimes we also had to climb rocks, but it wasn’t too hard. If I can give you advice, I’ll tell you to buy appropriate hiking shoes. Some of us were wearing inappropriate shoes and we had some issues, like slipping on the rocks. Another piece of advice that I’d give you, is to wear pants and not shorts, we ended up getting some rock burns during the climbing. Since the trail was pretty crowded and we took more time to finish it than planned, we decided to have lunch on the summit, which was a great idea, because we could spend more time admiring the beautiful view, so if you have the chance, you can do the same. The trail back to the bottom is pretty easy and well marked, so you probably won’t have any trouble on the way back."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Jordan Pond,Bodies of Water,4.5,Skip the meal just go for popovers,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The restaurant had an article posted about it being a gem.  Be aware that the parking is very difficult to find even with two lots in September.  The parking also serves for people doing walks along the pond and other hikes.  We teamed up with another couple to be a party of four.  We were given a beeper and told after 10 minutes that the wait would be an additional 15 minutes.  It was an hour.  We were the last to be seated outside on a pleasant lawn.  Since it was now 5 in the afternoon we decided to eat dinner as well as popovers.  I had a lobster roll which was below average for the market price of $35.  The side salad was minimal for an additional cost.  My spouse had seafood chowder which was lukewarm, thin and sparse in terms of seafood.  It was mostly tiny onions and potato pieces.  The popovers were OK.  The wasps wouldn’t give up trying to eat the strawberry jam.  Would I go again?  I would go for “tea” for the popovers and leave out the meal.  I would appreciate knowing an accurate time for the wait."

Tourists mostly congregate on the beautiful lawn behind the gift shop and the restaurant. The views of the tranquil pond, the Bubbles, and the mountains on both sides are breathtaking and soothing. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Jordan Pond,Bodies of Water,4.5,Very scenic hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hike with stunning views of the pond.  You can hike around the entire pond.  The second half (going counter clockwise) has some uneven spots.  We usually just hike halfway around and do the crossover trail to Eagle Lake then back the way we came and enjoy some popovers at the Jordan House.
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Jordan Pond,Bodies of Water,4.5,Great walk around the pond,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an incredibly beautiful path around Jordan Pond - but go early or parking is a nightmare! We arrived a little after 8:30 am and had no trouble with parking and a relatively empty trail for the first hour or so.  The restaurant starts taking names at 10 am so the place is packed after that! When we returned from the pond loop we waited in line about 20 minutes to put our name in and then were seated within 15 minutes since there were only 2 of us. I think an early hike is the way to go - then just make the best of the wait for the restaurant. I have to say that the popovers and the blueberry crisp lived up to their reputation!
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Jordan Pond,Bodies of Water,4.5,My Favorite Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Acadia has so much variety, but I think the Jordan Pond is the most peaceful. It can get very crowded during peak times, and the parking lot is nearly impossible to find a spot from 10am-2pm. Go in the morning or evening when crowds are low. We combined the Jordan Pond with the South Bubble Trail to get an elevated view of everything."

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Jordan Pond,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Words cannot express the beauty in Acadia and Maine in general.  We rented E-bikes and rode the Carriage roads to Jordan Pond House.  We got there at 11:15 and still had to wait 1 hour for a table to eat at the Jordan Pond House due to the crowds.  E-bike is the way to get there without worrying about parking.  Otherwise, highly recommend parking at the Hull's Cove Visitor Center and taking the shuttle.  Food was ok, still delicious, but very simple.  Popovers were awesome!!"
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Jordan Pond,Bodies of Water,4.5,A good healthy walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We always enjoy the peacefulness of the lake, loons, frogs, beavers, fresh air and trees while on the 3.5 mile walk around Jordan Pond. The walk is so varied time goes by quickly. This year My 4 y/o grand daughter came along and needed a piggy back ride at times. We also saw a few baby carriages had to turn around 1/2 way into the walk b/c of the terrain. So, be prepared for a few breaks,  'less is best' and Bring good walking shoes suitable for a damp environment, gravel trails, wooden planks and a bit of walking over/through boulders. Then be prepared for a worthy long wait at the restaurant for expert pop overs and tea."

It's a very popular area so try to arrive early.  We got there around 8 and there was still plenty of parking, but it was full when we finished.  The Jordan Pond Path makes a 3 mile loop around the lake with nice views.  The hike is moderate if you stay on Jordan Pond Path, no significant elevation gain but a few rocky spots on the west side of the lake.  No swimming is allowed however.  Several other trails link up with Jordan Pond Path to extend the hike.  We also hiked up to the Bubbles, which was a great hike as well."

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Park Loop Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Rewarding even in foul weather,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We happened to drive the park loop road on a foul-weather day with frequent heavy rains, and it was still worthwhile, especially for the views of spontaneous waterfalls cascading down the steep rock faces typical of the Mount Desert Island terrain. The road affords many convenient turnouts with helpful, and colorful, interpretive signs. The ever-changing scenery can be spellbinding in any season. An early start is recommended, as traffic builds over the course of the day, regardless of the weather. Moreover, remember that bad driving is as common in a national park as anywhere else. When in doubt, slow down, or even use pullouts to let tailgaters pass. You are here for the unhurried serenity, not to indulge the manic, thoughtless, or careless."

To understand how to enjoy Acadia, you sort of need the history. Civic groups and wealthy people (Philanthropists) made the park possible by purchasing and donating the land to US Government. There is no other National Park like it. There are little pockets of the park that are easily missed if you stay on Park Loop Road. Take a good look at the map and, if you have time, get off the Loop Road and explore places like Schoodic Peninsula."

There are more things to see like the lighthouse and other hikes not on the loop.  The loop takes you through forests, seeing mountains as well as the seacoast (both rocky and sandy - yes they have a rare sandy beach).  We visited just as they were opening the state up after CV19, so it wasn't crowded - although I could see it being crazy crowded with traffic and challenges parking in a ""normal"" season.  Stop along the way and see the various sights that are easy walks and consider getting adventurous and hiking some of the trails.  Beehive was my wife's favorite trail of all the trails we've hiked around the country."

But, now we know and someday we will come back there. The Park gets crowded regardless Covid-19. I can only imagine how it looked like before. You need at least 3-4 hours, just to brush off some points. It is not a bad idea to drive around first gets some impression what you like to do and then stop at certain spots and explore them more.  The Sand Beach is very busy, unless you like to spend some time on a beach or swim, I would skip it. However, there is very nice – not too easy walk along coastline from the Sand Beach to Otter Pont. Watch out for bicyclist."

However, thunder hole, Jordan’ s Pond house, sand beach, and all the other places you wish to see you are the mercy of being blessed with open parking. Way to crowded for our our taste. Went back around 4:30 and got right into Jordan’s Pond House with tons of parking available. Want to enjoy the park wait until the afternoon when crowds then out."

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Park Loop Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,You can get to most of the highlights from the loop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As the name implies, the Park Loop Road takes you around the park, where you can stop at many of the highlights. In several places the road is one way and you can park to the side of the right most lane.  We visited over Labor Day weekend and the park was quite crowded with cars parked bumper to bumper along the main stretch of the loop.  Be sure, when you park, that you park entirely on the road and not off to the far right, on the grass.  We parked to the far right, with our tires on the grass when we first arrived, and came back to find a parking warning on our car.  I walked up and down the road a bit and found that every car that had the warning, had tires on the grass, whereas the cars that didn’t, were fully on the road.  Also, if you are visiting when it is crowded, if you see a spot on the road more/less close to what you want to see, then take it.  When we were there, every parking area was full, and if you pass up spots on the side of the road and find no parking elsewhere, you can’t just turn around and look again – you need to drive all the way around the loop again.  The loop may not seem long, but it is, if the park is crowded, and you need to wait in a long line of cars entering the park at one point in the loop."

On a clear day the views are awesome. Some things to be aware of: Cadillac is part of Acadia National Park and requires a park pass, which can be purchased at the gift shop on Cadillac or many other places, including online. You can get a seven day pass if you are just visiting, but I took advantage of the lifetime senior pass for all the national parks ($80). It is often windy on the top of Cadillac, so bringing a jacket or sweater is a good idea, even in summer. As of Oct. 1 , Acadia is requiring timed passes to go on the Cadillac summit road. You have to buy them online and they give you a time you can go up, after which you can stay as long as you want. recreation.org is the web site for purchasing these."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Cadillac Mountain,Mountains,5.0,Beautiful views ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This drive takes getting online and buying a park pass before coming for $30 a week on recreation.gov. In Addition, between oct 1-18 you also need an online reservation ($2) from same website. They will allow you entry 30 min before your time.  If you want to do the sandy beach drive as well, space that reservation about 1 hour to max 1.5 hours AFTER your Cadillac mountain drive. It’s beautiful and a highlight of the area. Definitely add it to your Bar Harbor to-do list. "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Cadillac Mountain,Mountains,5.0,Reservation Fee Totally Worth It!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Must visit while visiting Acadia National Park!  I purchased a timed ticket ahead, and I was glad!  Our reservation was at 7 PM, and we were allowed to enter at 6:30 PM.  Because of the reservation requirement, parking was plentiful.  We ate our packed dinner up here (and threw everything away in a trash bin afterward).  We could see beautiful sunset while relaxing on a large rock.  "
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Cadillac Mountain,Mountains,5.0,Here Come the Sun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sunrise on Cadillac Mountain is NOT to be missed. This truly was the highlight of our trip to Acadia national park.  We had reservations, which everyone must have now, for 4AM through Recreation.gov. The reservations allows you to enter for 120 minutes up to 2 hrs before or after. We entered the park at 4:10 AM and there was already a crowd gathering as the light was already beginning. There were clouds, but we were surprised at how much those clouds added to the color of the shy. The photos posted here were taken beginning at 4:17 AM, so you can see that it was already an amazing experience. Bring a blanket or heavy jacket because the wind really blows on the mountain and the temps are cooler than in town. Rangers make sure that people stay out of the marked areas, but there is plenty of room for everyone to spread out and find their own zen as the sun rises to tough first light on the USA. It is not to be missed!"

Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Cadillac Mountain,Mountains,5.0,Spectacular View,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When the weather is nice and clear air, there is a spectacular view of the Atlantic Ocean, all the islands and bays. It is worthy to drive up, spend just a few minutes or lingered longer walking over stones from one side to another.  It would be much safer if all people adhere to recommendation of wearing masks, but... there is always some who does not like that idea. Outside of that have fun, perhaps have some lunch and enjoy the view."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Cadillac Mountain,Mountains,5.0,Must See During your Acadia Visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Cadillac Mountain is the tallest peak at Acadia National Park and offers amazing views in all directions. It can be reached by hiking up several trails or driving up the road. Timed tickets are needed to use the road and these can be purchased online (there is a link from the Acadia National Park main page). The drive up is itself a great experience with multiple overlooks where you can stop by. At the top there is a gift shop and a few short trails. Like most of Acadia, this can get busy. I recommend going to the ""true summit"" near the cell phone tower which is less busy (although you don't get 360 views because of the trees)."
Acadia National Park,Maine (ME),Cadillac Mountain,Mountains,5.0,Great place to see the sunrise or sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You need reservations to drive up Cadillac Mountain.  During the busy season, the best times (sunrise and sunset) sell out quickly.   If you find they are sold out, check back again, 2 days before at 10am, as new tickets are released, however, they go fast.   We got a reservation for approx. an hour and a half before sunset.  We drove up to the top parking lot on the right, parked, walked around and then approx. a half hour before sunset, walked down to the parking lot area on the left, where we were told is the best view.   This area quickly filled up with perhaps hundreds of people sitting on the rocks, some having picnics, waiting for the sunset – and it was worth the wait.  It was beautiful and well worth the effort to get there.  "
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park,National Parks,5.0,Day Trip to Prince Edward Hotel and Red Rock Canyon in Waterton Lakes National Park – The Canadian Side of Glacier Natio,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"While staying at Many Glacier Hotel in Glacier National Park during the first week of September 2013, hubby and I decided to take a day trip and drive northward along the Chief Mountain International Highway (Hwy 17) into Waterton Lakes National Park in Canada.  The drive up was beautiful, with the rolling plains and ranches to the east as far as the eye could see, and the peaks of the Rockies on the west.  "
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park,National Parks,5.0,More beauty awaits south of Waterton Lakes National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After visiting Waterton Lakes National Park, and learning it's the first international peace park. I wanted to see what's south of it, and find it's more stunning and has more natural beauty. Not saying that Waterton Lakes National Park is a dud, but geographically there's more to see on the American side. Coming from Alberta, I would recommend going to the US via the Chief Mountain border crossing which is highway #6 in Alberta, and changes to highway #17 in Montana. Follow that to highway #89 in Montana to the St. Mary's entrance to start off the Going To The Sun Road. That's where the fun and adventure begins. You see the famous St. Mary's Lake with the Wild Goose Island, Logan's Pass, and Lake MacDonald just to highlight some of the attractions to see. You need to check this out for yourself, and being from Calgary, Alberta it's not too far of a drive. This is compared to many living in the U.S. who have to drive cross country. The Going To The Sun Road is a one stop shop to see a bit of everything in the park. Another gem I found was when in the West Glacier town, I found a travel Alberta building which highlights what you can do and see in my home Canadian province. Finished my visit there by driving highway #2 in Montana and heading back to highway #89 until back to Alberta in Canada. It's something you need to see if you like to escape in the mountains, but you can only do this drive in the summer time since it's snowed over for most of the year."

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park,National Parks,5.0,Every penny worth the visit - Goat Haunt,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stayed at a rustic cabin at the Lake McDonald lodge...It was comfy small cabin and had a very good view of the sunrise above the mountains. We had arrived the day earlier and drove through the Going to the sun highway. It was very scenic but be cautioned of the traffic congestion as it undergoing construction. The weather was awesome, from abundant sunshine to rain and snow on the upper slopes. We were there the last week of August and had to deal with snow.  We wanted to do the Peace Treaty Hike but came to know it had to be booked well in advance. So we decided to go to Goat Haunt. This region is accessible only from the Canadian section of the park through a small boat ride."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park,National Parks,5.0,Glacier is one of the most scenic National Parks in America,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Glacier National Park is spectacular. The scenery is awesome. However it has some draw backs. The park is separated into a west and east side connected by a single into the SUN road that can take hours to pass depending upon weather, traffic and the ever present construction. The West Glacier side is by far the better from the stand point of public accommodations, restaurants and activities. The East Glacier town and St. Marys really do not offer much. The issue is you have to travel to the east side of the park to get to Waterton NP in Canada and Mani Glacier areas of the park. If you drive from the East Glacier to West Glacier it can take over an hour close to 60 plus miles. Otherwise you have to drive the into the sun road. It is beautiful but time consuming and typical high mountain driving. Also the road from St.Mary's where where the into the SUN road ends to East Glacier is in terrible condition with some areas just loose gravel.  Plan accordingly!"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park,National Parks,5.0,July visit a plus with smart planning!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent 5 days in July in the international peace park - half in USA Glacier NP and half in Alberta Canada  Waterton Park. Beautiful weather, amazing sights, and wildlife too!  Did our hiking in Glacier NP due to the 2017 fire in Waterton. Entered the west entrance and took our time driving Going-to-the -Sun road that first day - it doesn’t open entirely until July. Spent the rest of the time In the eastern parts. Hiked Highline Trail to Granite Chalet and down to the Loop shuttle - it’s 12 miles and well worth it for those able-bodied types. Hiked at Many Glacier up to Grinnell Lake & back. Hiked at St. Mary’s Lake. Start early and be parked by 8am (especially at Logan Pass) & you are set for the day.  We also made advance reservations at Many Glacier and Prince of Wales Hotels.  The views from these hotels are jaw-dropping and the locations put you right where you want to be for many activities. Bring your Passport!"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park,National Parks,5.0,Book your Trip for August (only) - United Nations (takeover) too lazy to remove snow!,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was my first trip to Glacier Park which I had dreamed about visiting for many years.  Finally, we were able to plan an excursion north to Montana.  Obviously, the ONE thing we wanted to do was travel the ""Going to the Sun Road,"" which is an awesome experience, however, upon arriving the middle of JULY, after paying $25 to enter the park,  we were informed the road was CLOSED! I was so shocked I could not believe that the lazy, good for nothing, ""United Nations Initiative"" had not removed the snow!  So we drove thousands of miles to photograph and write about the glaciers and see the wildlife there to no avail! Instead, we encountered marginal lodging in East & West Glacier park and were eaten alive with flies and mosquitoes!  We had to drive a hundred miles around the outside of Glacier Park to get to the western side because the ""Going to the Sun Road"" was closed, as stated above.  Our accommodations were already booked, so we didn't have another option.  To be honest, for the money we spent to see Glacier,  it was a GREAT disappointment.  Do yourself a favor and don't make the same mistake we did in assuming that the ""United Nations Initiative"" will have Glacier Park open in July.  Book your reservations in August ONLY to be sure the ""Going to the Sun Road"" will finally be open!  Also, book hotel accommodations near the park which are more modern for a better value. (See poor reviews of Glacier Lodge & Lake McDonald Cabins).  Note:  Glacier Park legitimately belongs to the citizens of the United States of America & has been sold OUT to the vermin of the United Nations!  It is an abomination!  The ""United Nations Initiative"" could not even remove the snow by the middle of July!  What a farce!  Buy a book of the once great park before the great sell-out, enjoy the photographs, and save yourself hundreds of dollars!"

Many very strenuous hikes  whose elevation is over 7000 feet  can make one's hearts beat rapidly.  If lucky, mountain goats may become your hiking companions. "
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park,National Parks,5.0,Beautiful scenery,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The scenery in Glacier is lovely.  The lakes have the most incredible color.  We hiked some of the trails in the ""Easy Day Hike"" guidebook.  I was not impressed with Avalanche Lake.  The climb was strenuous (for a 50 yr old Texan) and just not worth the destination.  The lake is surrounded by 3 mts, but the waterfalls are on the other side- another 30 minute hike around the lake.  The shore is muddy and there are flies galore.  Do visit Avalanche gorge at the beginning of the trail-  it is truly gorgeous.  Then walk up the trail a little to see the river that feeds it.  When you can no longer see the river, turn around and go back.  Go to Logan's Pass-  arrive before 9:00 am or you risk not getting a parking spot (high season).  Do the Hidden Lake trail behind the visitor's center.  It is steep in places, but you will be rewarded with incredible vistas.  We saw mountain goats on the trail.  There also was still snow on the ground- easier to walk through before it starts melting later in the day.   Walk across the road to the Highland trail, go down until you ooh an ah over the view and then go back.   The trail gets very narrow and the drop off is very steep.  You have a wire to hold on to and then...... they take away your wire...      The look out above Mary Lake is worthwhile also.  If you are looking for wildlife I think you need to go very early in the season or maybe to the Glacier Lake area (we didn't go up there)    There are no fowl at water fowl lake this time of year, but the lake itself is a gorgeous color.  You can see it from your car.   Enjoy"

If you are in the area, this is absolutely worth a stop. I would not drive all the way to this entrance just for this falls, though - it's a long drive and the road to the entrance is very rough, narrow and windy. (We were driving a class B RV from the north so that influences this - a truck would be fine although it would still take a long time, and the road is not quite as rough coming from East Glacier.)"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Running Eagle Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Excellent Short Hike to Waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked the short trail to Running Eagle Falls off the main road in the Two Medicine part of the park. The trail was flat and easy to traverse for all skill levels. The waterfall at the end was nothing short of stunning! The waterfall in early July was exclusively flowing under the natural bridge which was unlike any falls I had seen before. There was many butterflies in the area. We hiked back along the nature trail to complete a small loop. The nature trail described a number of the common tree and plant species found in the area. This was a great place to visit!
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Running Eagle Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,A unique waterfall indeed!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a short and sweet little hike to a gorgeous waterfall on the road to the Two Medicine campground. The falls are actually quite unique as part of the falls seem to come straight out of the mountain while the rest of the falls come down over the top like normal falls. The parking lot and trailhead are along the Two Medicine road shortly before the campground. The trail is flat, and is about a half mile total out and back. There are several great views of the falls along the way and a lookout perch at the end. If you're brave you can go beyond the end of the trail and even take a dip in the pool at the bottom of the falls. We didn't do this but we saw some who did. This is a ""must do"" if you go to Two Medicine. "
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Running Eagle Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Unique Waterfall - Very Easy to Visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Running Eagle Falls, also called Trick Falls, is one of the most interesting and unique waterfalls in Glacier National Park. The waterfall is located in the Two Medicine area of the park and the hike to the falls is about a half-mile and easy. From the trailhead, follow the well-maintained, handicapped accessible trail about a quarter-mile to a viewing platform for the falls. You can also climb around on the rocks to get a closer view. The waterfall is on Two Medicine Creek, between Two Medicine Lake and Lower Two Medicine Lake. The water falls into a sinkhole and then cascades out of the cliff face. The nickname Trick Falls derives from the fact that the water appears to be coming out of the side of the cliff. We visited in summer when the water level was low. In the spring, there is a second upper waterfall here - a tall free fall over the cliff face that obscures the lower cascades. Unfortunately, we weren't able to see the upper falls as the water level was too low. Anyway, this is a really cool waterfall in the Two Medicine area and worth the easy hike to visit at any time."

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Running Eagle Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Nice Falls but go to Two Medicine Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the best kept secrets of Glacier Park is Two Medicine Lake, which is near Running Eagle Falls, and all of the trails available for hiking.  Because it is on the other side of the park, by East Glacier, most visitors don't get all the way over there.  This was great for us, because there were not many people and the trails were very sparse of hikers. We hiked Paradise Point, Aster Falls and Aster Park Overlook.  Someone had seen moose hiking ahead of us but we missed it.  We did hike by a beaver dam which was pretty neat.  The view from the lookout is really great and it is a neat hike with different terrain and foliage along the way.  Two Medicine Lake itself is beautiful and we would have liked to canoe but ran out of time.  We enjoyed this area of the park immensely and hope it remains less traveled."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Running Eagle Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,"A don't miss for even ""tenderfeet"" and non-hikers",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Running Eagle Falls is a great destination for those who do not hike but want to see a beautiful spot just off the beaten path. The Falls also has a wonderful legend that goes with it. The legend is posted on a sign in the parking lot and lends a lot of meaning to the falls itself. The hike in is hardly a hike, just 1/4 mile or 400 meters from the parking lot, all on level ground in a pleasant forest setting. In the summer make sure you bring the bug spray. All of Glacier National Park is bear country so it's best to have bear spray with you and know how to use it."

Seeing first the first light hitting the Tetons then latter the sun hitting the barn.  Fantastic Views."
Moose,Wyoming (WY),Mormon Row Historic District,Historic Sites,4.5,Stunning Stargazing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is where we went to stargaze and it was the highlight of our trip. I am not kidding! Seeing the Milky Way in the dark, dark night sky was absolutely stunning. Our minds were blown. (We also went for the sunset, but without any clouds that wasn't spectacular.) But no clouds is perfect for the night sky. I recommend downloading the SkyView app to help you identify the stars, constellations, etc. This is free and fabulous!"
Moose,Wyoming (WY),Mormon Row Historic District,Historic Sites,4.5,TA Moulton Barn Iconic Photo.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Mormon Row Historic District is a farm community of 27 rustic farms, barns, and houses built in the 1890s by Mormon settlers. The area is renowned for its mountain scenery and is one of the most photographed spots in the park. The district attracts people from all over and the TA Moulton Barn is a popular photo destination. I was impressed with how good the farm buildings looked considering how old they are."
Moose,Wyoming (WY),Mormon Row Historic District,Historic Sites,4.5,A must-see for photographers during your visit to Grand Teton National Park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Established during the 1890s by Mormon settlers to the Jackson Hole Valley, Mormon Row is a historic district in Grand Teton National Park that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  My wife and I visited here on a cloudy and drizzly day during mid-September 2022."
Moose,Wyoming (WY),Mormon Row Historic District,Historic Sites,4.5,Beautiful beyond words,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Any time you see pictures of the Tetons, you always see the T.A. Moulten barn. We had to stop to take the obligatory photos, but I'm so glad we did. Beyond the beauty, the prairie dogs chirping and running in and out of their burrows. So much fun!"
Moose,Wyoming (WY),Mormon Row Historic District,Historic Sites,4.5,Amazing views and lighting on this Historic Barn,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I got up super early to drive out to Mormon Row to take some sunrise photographs. Found a place to park, (as it can get very crowded) stood outside in 30 degree weather to get several photos with different lighting opportunities."
Moose,Wyoming (WY),Mormon Row Historic District,Historic Sites,4.5,Just Like the Pictures,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got here very early in the morning, so it very cold. We watched the sunrise over the famous barn and it looked like we were in a movie. The backdrop of the mountains didn't even look real. It was truly breathtaking to see in person. Definitely come here!!"
Moose,Wyoming (WY),Mormon Row Historic District,Historic Sites,4.5,A Little Off the Beaten Path,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"You get some great (but distant) views of the Tetons from these barns.  Overall, I thought the barns themselves were a little boring, but the park was still amazing.  The barns are a little out of the way from the rest of the attractions in Grand Tetons National Park.  We got here a little late in the day and my phone had died by then, so unfortunately I didn't get any pictures.  I would actually suggest going here first thing when visiting the park, then starting in the main park."

Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Chance of seeing wildlife ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The drive up to the summit of Signal Mountain was nice but not a must see for us. We did see some different wildflowers since the drive is heavily wooded and the elevation increases. There seems to be a good chance of seeing wildlife but you really need to keep your eyes peeled because the animals will likely be hanging out in the woods. It was a nice afternoon drive for us. Please remember that it is ""wildlife"" and don't be afraid to remind others. There were several ""people"" trying to walk up to a bear."
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Great views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Signal Mountain Summit is the top of a 5 mile road right off the highway. There is an observation and parking area to get a great view of the Tetons. It is a very narrow road though with a bunch of switchbacks, and RV's and trailers are prohibited from this drive. Very neat place to stop, and we saw a young black bear at the top!"
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Don't Miss the Jackson Point Overlook,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Definitely take this road trip off the 42 mile scenic drive.  Two overlooks to see at the top:  Jackson Point and the East View.  See both of them, but Jackson Point is fantastic.  Make sure you walk down past the end of the paved area, just another 200 feet or so along the dirt path.  Picture perfect view of the Tetons there.  "
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Great View of the Valley if you reach the top,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Most of the drive up is not too difficult for this mountain road. You eventually reach a small parking lot. We did not stop here because the lot was full and it didn't seem to have a very good view point nearby. We continued past to reach the top. But the road narrows so you really have to watch out for oncoming traffic. This part of the road also did not show up on Google Maps, so we weren't sure if this was right. But once we got to the top, there was a somewhat bigger parking lot and the sweeping view of the valley was superb. (I suspect that it might be frustrating in July/August to get up there and find the lot full -- there's nowhere else to park because of the narrow road.)"
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Signal Mountain Summit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The scenic drive up to Signal Mountain Summit is absolutely worth it. This is where we had some of the best views of the Tetons and JH. 
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Beautiful overlooks!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our second time in the Tetons. We didn't have time to do this drive the first trip, so we made sure to go this time. It was amazing ~ much better than I had anticipated. There are two places to stop and look. They have different views, and both are worth stopping. The lower stop (the first you'll come to) has about an 800 ft. walk to the overlook. The upper stop is a shorter walk up a paved sidewalk. We were lucky to be there on a clear day and loved the views. You get a good idea of the layout of the whole valley."
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Nice views - saw a bear,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It's a long windy road but if you have the time it's worth it. We got lucky and saw a bear on a hill next to the road. The rangers were there to make sure people didn't do anything dumb. But it was nice to be able to stop and take pictures of the bear and watch him in his natural habitat! He had no interest in us at all.
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Was sure what to expect,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The NPS app for the Tetons didn’t include anything for this which was weird. There are two parking lots along the road to the summit. The first one everyone was stopped at so we carried on up the road to the summit itself. We were the only ones there which made it nice. After talking in the views we headed down to the lower viewing area. Go a bit past the end of the payment down the dirt path for the best view. 
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Spectacular Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The views from there scenic overlook at the top of the mountain was worth the white knuckle (I don't like driving on steep curvy mountain roads) drive to the top.  The panoramic views of the valley and Grand Tetons were breathtaking.  And you actually do get a great cell phone signal at the top!  On the way back down we saw a beautiful moose eating by the road.  Well worth the time to drive to the top!
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Signal Mountain Summit Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Unexpectedly nice,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice drive in the woods to a low mountain top. We saw multiple animals on the drive, and at the top were suprised by a grouse at the parking lot. The views were nice but obstructed by a strong haze (probably california/oregon fires). The haze affected all views throughout the park."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,A very pleasant escape. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We love the Foothills Pkwy. If you have ever been in the stop and go traffic through Sevierville, Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg on a busy, or normal day, the Foothills Pkwy is a very pleasant escape. No restaurants, gas stations or tourist attractions except nature and beautiful vistas. Winding paved road with numerous scenic turn- outs. The speed limit is 25-35. Very little traffic. The Parkway roughly parallels the north boundary of The Great Smokey Mts National Park. There are three section I know of: Chilhowee Lake at the south up to Wallend takes about 45 minutes depending on how often and long you stop. Wallend to Pigeon Forge takes more or less an hour. You can travel the entire length in one day if you choose. We have done them on separate days. The third section is near Cosby at the NE corner of the Park. This short section of Parkway runs from highway 40 west to hwy 321 near Cosby. Not as long or dramatic as the Blue Ridge Pkwy. But a very pleasant and scenic drive. May be closed in winter. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,AMAZING VIEWS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I felt like I was driving in the clouds. The views up here on this side of the mountain are just breathtaking! Hardly any traffic.  Many pull off spots for pictures. You go up up up and down and back up, around curves. Lots of fun. Most all the traffic was headed to Newfound Gap 441 but we decided to hit the Foothills Parkway and it was the better choice.  We stopped and for moonshine (FOR LATER) and boiled peanuts for the road, right before the entrance of the Parkway. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Stormy and High Winds - Views Prevail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't let a little bad weather stop you from this drive to see the higher elevations for miles.  We did not have the best weather on our early Fall (just as leaves were starting to turn venture up the new Foothills Parkway.  Your tax dollars paid for it so by all means don't miss it!  Roads are smooth.  Several spots to pull over and take your photos.  Early is best...maybe before breakfast.  You can start in in Sevierville and end up in Townsend or vice-a-versa.  We opted to start in Sevierville and lunched at the Trailhead Steakhouse in Townsend.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Get back to nature on the Foothills Parkway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Millions of visitors to the immediate areas surrounding the Great Smoky Mountains National Park take in Pigeon Forge, Cherokee, and Gatlinburg but fail to take one of the most scenic drives in the park. The entire length of the Foothills Parkway is a must do. From vistas of the quaint village of Townsend to the Look Rock Tower where the mountains as well as the Tennessee valley open up for a 360 degree view of East Tennessee. There are no businesses on the Parkway so gas up ahead of time and there is a picnic area at Look Rock but I haven't used it myself to comment. Again, this drive is about million dollar vistas along the way."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Wonderful road with plenty of overlooks,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a wonderful ride with plenty of overlooks for pics. I would recommend starting at Hwy 321 near Cove Creek RV Resort and then go east. When you get near the Look Rock area, the road was closed for construction. But you can turn around and head back."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Beautiful Foothills Parkway,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We live in the area. We started thru Townsend TN. It was a beautiful day for a Sunday drive. The bulk of the people turned towards Cades Cove and we turned left for the quieter side of the Smoky Mountain. There were plenty of pull outs and picnic areas. We visited The Sinks (small parking) which was pretty. We did all of the sections. I love seeing the valley views, Walland to Wears. There are no garbage cans on the pull offs in the newer section so please don’t litter. It was a local and company worthy drive."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Great Drive Back to Gatlinburg from Cherohala and The Tail of the Dragon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful drive straight out of Gatlinburg that covers a good portion of the Smokeys. This is an awesome road, because if you decided to drive the Cherohala Skyway and finish up tail of the dragon, this is another scenic byway to bring you right back to TN. If you don't have time for the whole loop, this is still a very nice drive, but I recommend at least adding on the Tail of the Dragon if you can! If you take your time along this route and check all trails, there are tons of great hiking spots along here. There are also great lookouts for photos if you keep your eyes peeled."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Accidental treat!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We accidentally and unknowingly ended up on Foothills Parkway on our way back to our cabin. Our navigation routed us on this road and it was such a treat! Gorgeous motor trail through the Smokies with amazing views! Take the time to pull off at the various places that are just off the parkway in order to see some amazing views! We didn’t stop and I regret it. Driving the parkway doesn’t take much time at all!
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Foothills Parkway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Used to love it but know Drive at your own risk. ,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Used to be a great and safe ride. Now it has been taken over by idiots on motorcycles and cars flying up and down the road. Seeing some innocent person dieing on this road from these idiots. You really can't enjoy the views because you are being hounded by these idiots the entire drive.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Pleasant Surprise at the Southern End of the National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"First, if you have a Garmin GPS, do not rely on it to get you here.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Angry Karen,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was my first visit to the Oconaluftee Visitors Center. We did enjoy our visit and I have nothing but good things to say about it. The visitors center is nice with a good selection of products to buy and is educational. We loved the ""farm tour"", reading about all of the old buildings, etc. We enjoyed the stroll on the riverside trail, it was beautiful. When we started down the trail there was a cow and calf in the creek, we respectfully kept our distance, took a photo and went on down the trail. On the way back we walked up on a group of 25 people or so standing still and quiet with a park worker with a yellow vest. There was a young bull elk in the woods beside the creek feeding. The park worker asked us nicely to back down the trail as he fed our way, so we all obliged. The bull elk turned, crossed the trail and went into the field that was now full of other elk. The park worker asked us to remain still to allow him to walk out further. Two other female park workers with the same vest came running at us yelling. ""Are you stupid? Are you crazy? These are wild animals!!! That bull has been known to be aggressive toward humans, humans!! Everyone needs to get behind a tree, now! etc. etc. (there were a lot of trees between us and the young bull elk). After these women screamed and called us all names a gentleman said ma'am we are with a park worker and have done everything he has asked us to. In shock she then sees the other park worker who calmly says you all can proceed down the trail now as I have kept you safe, have a good day.  I am not sure if this woman is paid or volunteer but clearly needs to learn how to safely approach ""wild animals"" herself, take a class on how to properly talk to anyone in public without being a belligerent ass and be dismissed from her position. I wish I would have gotten her name, however we all assume it was Karen. I hope she realizes what an embarrassment she is to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center."

",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s been a year since we drove by to see the elk grazing in the fields by the visitor center. It’s been over two years since we went into the visitor center, and toured the exhibits behind it. You’ll find this place just 2 miles north of Cherokee or south of Gatlinburg, "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Helpful staff and great Farm Museum,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"In comparison to the Sugarland, this one is such a joy because plenty of parking space, staff are also knowledgeable and helpful. The big plus is the restrooms in separate buildings so you do not have to fight the line to get into the building. Also at the same site is a nice Mountain Farm museum displaying how mountaineers lived in the old days. Also a few minute drive is a restored Old Mingus Mill. It is not just good place to visit when you come in.  It is good to visit to get to know more about where you can visit leaving the Park."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Very nicely done,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Two adults visited this on a Tuesday in late September 2023 and thought this visitor center was very nicely done with all of the exhibits on formation of the park. We purchased the booklet and then walked through the adjacent outdoor Mountain Farm Museum and outbuildings. The $1 booklet filled in a lot of the gaps lacking in the museum’s signage. No rangers available in the museum and only a few chickens running around but we enjoyed ourselves. There is a couple of mile trail down to Cherokee from the visitor center but we didn’t have time to take it. Remember your parking pass.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Typical Visitor Center,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is basically your typical visitor center, but if you are entering the national park from Cherokee, NC, it would be a good first stop. The small museum displays were closed due to Covid. However, the visitor center does serve as an entrance to the Farm Museum, which is very interesting to stroll through."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,See the Mountain Farm,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Visitor Center has good info on the National Park.  The mountain farm is terrific providing an idea of mountain life in the past.  The structures are all buildings moved from farms in the Smoky Mountains.  Nice storyboards describe each building, how it was used. Etc. The creek/river along the village attracts kids anxious to wade in the water.  Relaxing area with a lot of history."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,"Sjperior to Sugarlands, make the drive",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"After the disappointment of Sugarlands I was set up for low expectations, but pleasantly surprised that this visitor center was far superior.  Wonderful exhibits with numerous video or audio components detail that people, programs and park over the years.  Reception staff were a bit busy talking among themselves while making me wait, then would not acknowledge that an exhibit contained (in writing) contradictory information, so you might not be getting the crack rangers we are used to behind the desk.  The building exhibits are a bonus, dovetailing with some of the information inside, and they are just a short walk on an even path.  It's a slow drive from the north entrance, but worth it to see the difference"
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Good Place to Start Your Visit to the Smoky Mountains,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stopped at this visitor center on our way into the park to get maps and any tips for sightseeing. The information desk did not volunteer much information only giving us a map. However, the facility had a large shop and I did find various brochures for sale which provided a lot more information. Important to note is that the park now requires a parking pass ($5 for one day) to park at any of the parking areas including scenic overlooks. The one-day passes are sold at an automatic kiosk adjacent to the parking lot. Have your license plate number ready."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Oconaluftee Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Picturesque,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family was planning on driving through Great Smoky Mountains National Park and we started on the NC side by stopping at the visitor center. They were busy, but not too many people to be uncomfortable. The visitor center has a museum, but it's currently closed due to COVID. They also have a store that is open. You can get some nice pictures though. They have a farm museum outside that is free. We didn't stop and read all the signs, but we did walk through the farm. It was very nice. Also, you can walk along a river/stream as well. This is a great place to go and get away from the hustle and bustle of life. If you are planning on visiting GSMNP this is worth a stop at the start or end of your journey.  It's free and I think kids would enjoy seeing the farm animals (chickens and roosters), and being outside."
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,A Maui must do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an absolutely amazing adventure. The day started at 2am so we could get to our tour bus at 3am. The bus ride was safe, Covid protocols were followed and our driver was quite experienced. It is a long ride up the mountain, and since it is early you can grab some sleep on the way up. "
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,One of the best tours on Maui,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We signed up for the Haleakala Sunrise Tours before we left for our Maui vacation. We were not thrilled about the early wake up to get picked up, but after reaching the summit of Haleakala and the national park, it was well worth it. Knowing that you are on a guided tour and that you don't have to worry about navigating the unknown park, let alone the altitude, in the dark is a guarantee of a safer trip. Our guide was an expert driver, and he was able to provide a lot of local commentary and color. We learned so much about the area as well as Maui and all of its inhabitants--plants, animals, and humans. "
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,Beautiful sunrise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It was beautiful little windy up there but the tour is way too long. They pick you up at about two in the morning and could really shorten the time by about an hour with some things removed. First of all the tour guide  ask everybody where they’re from and their story that took a half hour that we could’ve slept. It was one stop that we made where we had to call her and make an echo I didn’t even get out of the bus for that I was tired. We actually arrived way too early for the sunset I think some better planning and you could probably leave at 3 AM easily. Paid a ton of money for this tour and the electricity wasn’t even on up top so we had to use our houses. Not the tour company’s fault.   Also we were told we were supposed to get Parker‘s they wouldn’t hand them out to us so that was a really cold. When the Tours people called us they said they provided Parkers an extra parka would’ve been really helpful on that cold day it was very windy
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,MAKE SURE TO WEAR SNOW CLOTHES!!!!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very very cold extremely windy. This company makes you stand by the railing which is stupid but I guess it’s to save you a spot. I suggest actually camping out on the side of the buildings just to avoid the cold, and actually get to the railing at about 30 minutes before the sunset and you’ll still get a good spot. Now that I’ve given some advice, time to critique this company. Let’s start with the negatives, they pick you up about 2, as someone who normally sleeps at about 11 or 12, especially on vacation, I get my “solid” 2 ours of sleep at most if I don’t want to be late and get ready. It’s a huge of waste of time because the sunrise isn’t till about 6:30 to 6:50(Note I am visiting in February so the sunrise times and the temp might be different if you are reading this at a later date), they first make you go eat some crappy food which consists of disgusting fruits and some terrible pastries, the eating process takes almost an hour. When we actually arrive at the destination it’s about 3 to 4 already, but it’s cold as freak and we will be forced to wait at least 2 or more hours freezing to death. You find way better luck leaving at 4AM, getting their at around 5:30, camp in your own car for about 30 min until 6(By 6 the temps were dramatically less cold), and then come out and you’ll still get some great pre-sunrise shot and get a good spot for your sunrise. Now some positives, the actual driver and tour guide was very friendly, they knew all our names and helped us putting on the ponchos in the cold wind. They were also talking the entire time on the way about the history and everything 7 am in the morning probably very tired. I thank all the staff the staff their, but the company’s schedule is simply terrible. If you still want to go with this company, in which is not completely terrible, just make sure to wear very warm clothing "
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,Here are the reasons why a guided tour is the best option,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Below is my list for why a guided tour is the best option for this spectacular sunrise. 
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,Veltra Haleakala sunrise tour,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We’d read that the road to Haleakala’s summit was very winding so opted for a tour.  The driver was excellent and definitely knew a lot about Maui.  We arrived at the summit twenty minutes before sunrise with many other tour buses of tourists.  This made finding a spot near or at the front difficult.  Being quite short, I do wish those who are particularly tall would consider standing back some.  The trail from the bus to our viewing location was not lit making it more difficult to walk up.  If I go again, I’d bring a pocket size flash light with me.  Realizing it would be cold, and coming from Canadian winter weather, I layered with a tee shirt, wool sweater and a heavier spring coat.  I nearly froze!  To be fair, there ended up being a brisk wind making it far colder than the temperature on the thermometer.  Again, should I return, I’d still layer but would wear my mid weight winter coat with warm mitts.  As much as we enjoyed a gorgeous sunrise, it would have been an even better experience if I’d been warm.  It really is a beautiful location!"
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,Favorite excursion in Hawaii,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The hard part is getting up at an ungodly hour to experience this but once you see the sunrise you’ll be glad that you did. Please be aware you will need a mid weight jacket or heavy sweater but once the sun rises you’ll be fine. The bike ride was simply the icing on the cake and fret not about the length because 95% of the ride is downhill & anyone with the slightest athletic ability can do it. Trust me & book this ASAP

Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,Haleakala Sunrise Tour,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I would HIGHLY recommend this tour through Valley Isle Tours. We had a great time this morning with Billy, our tour guide. He was very informative, made us laugh and even taught us how to pick a ripe pineapple. He took the time to visit with us individually and made sure we were all comfortable. Dress warm for the tour by layering your clothes, it is really cold at the top of the volcano. Valley Isle Tours provided us with insulated ponchos to wear and stay warm and were a great help. I’d do the tour again. Thank you Billy for the fun."
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Sunrise Tours,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,Sunrise Tour with Nettie!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wow! Just wow! What an incredible experience! If you're lucky enough to get Nettie for your tour guide you will have an extra special time she's so great! Pay no attention to anyone saying ANYTHING negative about this experience. It's an adventure! Yes you get up early and it can be cold but it's well worth it! My wife is soft and she's done it twice so don't be a pansy! Dress with a few layers you'll be fine. Yes you can drive your own vehicle but only reservations allowed from 3am to 7am so book the tour certainly if you're a first-timer. The reason they pick you up early is so you get a good view! There can be crowds if you wait too late. So boo hoo it's early boo hoo it's cold get to bed get up and bring a jacket! Awesome time #2 on the must-do list while visiting Hawaiin islands and highly recommending to all! Always travel pono! Mahalo Nettie we love you aloha!

Kenai Fjords National Park,Alaska (AK),Six Mile Creek,Bodies of Water,4.5,Awesome rafting experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had an awesome rafting experience going down Six Mile Creek in Southcentral Alaska. The water was high and the drysuite does not always keep you totally dry, but you sure would not want to do it without the suit. We were only going to do the first two canyons, but had so much fun we decided to stay on for the third canyon and it was well worth it. Great guides and great experience!"
Kenai Fjords National Park,Alaska (AK),Six Mile Creek,Bodies of Water,4.5,A very nice experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Indeed very nice and in some ways even more, but not because of the rapids (we did class 3 and 4 only), but more because of the conditions. Getting dressed in real dry suites, which allow you to enter and swim in waters of around 42 degrees Farenheit. And yes, before you board the boats you will experience a 2-3 minutes swim/float in the icy waters. And not only will you be fine, but you'll enjoy it tremendously. Then you'll do the actual rafting and much based on your guide's experience and ability to drive you to follow his/her instructions, you'll enjoy white water rafting of an hour or more with not too many challenges, but very enjoyable."
Kenai Fjords National Park,Alaska (AK),Six Mile Creek,Bodies of Water,4.5,Very fun whitewater,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My cousin and I went down 6 mile with Chugach outdoor center while the river was very high from a combination of rain and snow melt from the mountains. We had a hot, sunny, bluebird day even down in the narrow parts of the canyon. Nova also does commercial trips on 6 mile and I have heard they also do a good job. If you enjoy technical whitewater this trip will have a grin on your face the whole time. There are sections of this canyon that are barely wide enough for the rafts to fit sideways and during the spring and even into July depending on the summer the water is thumping thru these sections. It's a great way to spend a morning or afternoon. You get outfitted with a dry suit, helmet, life jacket and pair of old tennis shoes to protect the dry suits feet. The guides will tell ya everything you need to know along the way. Definitely a must do for people who love whitewater, and hopefully the water is HIGH! One thing is if the water is above a certain level they will have center mounted oar frames and the guide will be doing most of the paddling. You will have also paddles and you will be getting commands."

My daughter and son were both pulled to safety by the safety boat, but my other son ended up going down multiple class 5 rapids.  We were all ok, but we drank a lot of water and we felt we were fighting for our lives.  Stick with the class 3's and 4's."

You can pitch a tent or RV and walk or drive down to the beach. This place has camp sites mostly for RVs but a handful of tent camp sites. Most of them placed right next to each other so not much privacy. We got lucky and found one that the grass grew tall so was kind of walled off. We drove our expedition to the beach. We could have drove down the beach a ways but choose not to being our first time doing something like this and did not want to take the chance of getting stuck. We had the clam gun but it only works on the sandy part of the beach. A lot of the beach is gravel type sand and it did not work as well. We found a couple of sand bars and left with about 30 clams in about 2 hours. We were there mostly for the adventure. We plan on returning there or to another beach next year. We had a blast working as a team digging to victory!!

It was a little difficult at first, those little suckers are fast, but we got the hang of it and before we knew it had a bucket full of razor clams..We took our clams back to the cabin and watched a youtube video to see how to clean them. We  fried them up..really good and we  had enough to freeze for later. It was  really fun. Oh,  you need waders though you will sink in the mud, and don't wear jewelry. We went around 11am and stayed until about 1:30pm. You have to look for the little holes/dimples and then dig like crazy..It was nice to have something to experience that did not cost and arm and a leg.."

We've visited two years in a row, and are planning a third. It is easy driving from Soldotna, where there are plenty of motels. (Also, excellent salmon fishing in a city park in Soldotna.) There is a campground just above the beach. It only has community water and restroom/outhouses for amenities, but it IS Alaska wilderness. Plenty of moose to view, you can see the three inactive volcanoes across the water. And we limited on clams every time we went except for once. Mostly razor clams, but also a few butter clams. (Very good cooked over campfire with garlic and butter, wrapped in foil!)  It's a great place for families or couples. Great outdoor experience."

I wish I could exploit the treatment and misconduct of the island more but this is the best I can do. I would never recommend staying the night on the island to anyone. I cleaned the rooms personally and they are disgusting. There are articles of the room that are never washed for the entire summer. Don’t mistake that when the website say refers to individual cabins, it actually means the two duplexes and a fourplex. If you stay you’re gonna share the entire experience with your neighbors. The walls are thin so don’t count on privacy. "

What a treat!  Initially, when we arrived for lunch on the island, we were quite sceptical - the all-you-can-eat prime rib and salmon bake is mediocre cafeteria style food served on paper plates.  We were in a large room with several hundred starving people, and it was most unpleasant.  After lunch, however, we were separated from the crowds and shown to our lovely, spacious waterfront cabin.  We then took a nature walk with a naturalist from the Park Service, and spent the afternoon hiking, resting and seeing wildlife.  Dinner was superb - the chef is very creative and talented.  The wines were first class.  Breakfast the next morning was also terrific, and the boat tour was wonderful.  This was an expensive two days, but well worth it!"

This particular day it was raining as Seward's area is known for it's rain. The room was packed full of travelers ready to board the ship. I would advise you to get their early so you can get your tickets and find a place to sit. The ship was enclosed for most of us and open to those who wanted to brave the elements. It was hard taking pictures as my camera wanted to focus more on the raindrops than the whale jumping out of the water. I finally gave up on my camera so I could see them come out and see who we all were. The Grandkids, loved it as did we. The ride was a smooth one as I was afraid I might get seasick, yet my land-legs didn't mind it at all. My daughter was a little queasy, so take some Dramamine just in case. The Captain of the ship was a great tour guide and explained about Seward's history, the coastline, the birds and everything. Now. as far as FOX Island goes. SPEND THE NIGHT! Yes, it might cost a lot more, but I think it would be worth it. We went for the lunch cruise. They have a dinner one as well. By the time we got there, had a fantastic lunch and a Ranger talking about how the Island became Fox Island, then for the kiddos to do their lesson book to win a prize, there was no time to venture out in the rain much. We grabbed some souvenirs, ran the kids to the restroom and the ship did it's last honk honk, we were the last ones to board. So, it was a rushed trip for sure. Next time I want to spend the night and take a look around Fox Island."

We retreated to the inside of the boat for warmth from time to time.  Our stay on Fox Island was the perfect way to cap off a very fun boat trip.

We took plenty of breaks on the way up and were much faster coming back down after a long break at the top! It was sooo worth it! The views are phenomenal. Also be bear aware! 1.5 miles up we heard a startling grunt beside us on the trail. Then brush snapping and another grunt! We hustled as fast as we could to get out of that forested section! At the end we checked in with the ranger and were told it was a black bear that other hikers actually saw 15 minutes behind us on the trail. That was scary so make sure you take precautions !

We could have gone higher but there was snow on the trail even when we stopped.  Great views along the way and came surprisingly close to a black bear - so be aware on the trail.  Would love to go back to reach the top.
Kenai Fjords National Park,Alaska (AK),Harding Ice Field Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,One tough hike that is worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one tough hike. Be prepared to spend a good portion of the day on this one.  Steady uphill climb for the first 4 miles, but the views from the top are well worth it.  I would suggest trekking poles, plenty of water and snacks. Our total hike from parking lot to the edge of the ice field and back was 11.5 miles. Get there early because the parking lot fills up by mid morning.  This is a busy trail, so don't think you will be out there alone., "

Wish we would have trained for it. We did make it to the very top. It took us all of 8hrs and I would have liked to rest more both up and down. Trekking poles were very helpful  climbing rocks and on snow near the top in mid-July. Lots of great views 1/2 to 3/4 to top, so possible to make a little shorter and still great hike. Top is amazing though."

It’s a bit of a tough trail at parts but doable if you pack the right gear (layers, good hiking boots, rain layers, and a good winter hat). It can get cold and rainy up on the field.

Kenai Fjords National Park,Alaska (AK),Harding Ice Field Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Amazing hike, Top Alaskan experience",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this trail with our 10 and 8 year old children.  We were very lucky that the weather was perfect.  I actually planned our Alaskan trip around this hike.  I had initially wanted to come to Alaska a few years ago.  But knowing that our kids wouldn’t be able to make the hike, I decided to put off our entire Alaskan trip until the kids are old enough to do it.  And I am glad we made that decision.  It’s a very tough hike.  The total distance is about 8 miles round trip, and you gain 3000ft in elevation.  The good thing is that the elevation itself is not bad, starting at 500ft, ending around 3500ft.  "
Kenai Fjords National Park,Alaska (AK),Harding Ice Field Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Plan Ahead on your stopping point,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"There are various descriptions of how long this hike is. According to my experience, the trail head is 0.4 miles from the visitor center, and the trail is 3.9 miles one way. So in total it’s 8.6 miles from the visitor center. There is also a little over 3000 feet elevation gain from the visitor center to the end of the trail. The mile markers in my review are all from the trail head. Mile 1.3 is the Marmot Meadows viewpoint. There is a giant relatively flat rock just a little off the trail that you can see Exit Glacier very well. This point is a little over 1000 feet elevation gain, so the hike up to this point is certainly not considered easy at all. This is the first good point for you to turn back. The next good turning back point is at mile 1.6, Bottom of Cliffs. The final turn back point is at mile 2.3, Top of the Cliffs. The difficult hike becomes really strenuous after this point and honestly the view of the Glacier does not get better until you get all the up to the end of the trail. The day we were there, it was misty to begin with, and it became a steady rain by the time we got to the Top of the Cliffs. We came prepared with rain poncho. I want to give a shout-out to my kids, ages 9 and 13. I wouldn’t have made it if it wasn’t for the fact that they were so much ahead of me and couldn’t hear me calling them back, so I was left with no choice but to keep climbing up with the rain right in my face and wind blew against me. I want to emphasize the hike up is STRENUOUS and you really need good hiking shoes to keep you from slipping and your feet from getting wet. There are areas on this trail where you don’t see Exit Glacier at all, and it’s all black rock that made me feel like I was on Mars. I am beyond proud that we made it all the way up. There is an emergency shelter at mile 3.6. It’s small shelter with a couple of snow shovels. There is no bench or anything to sit on. It was an interesting read of who’s being there from the writings on the wall as I sat on the floor to rest. "
Kenai Fjords National Park,Alaska (AK),Harding Ice Field Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Great hiking experience for the whole family,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the trail in mid-July. We started out late in the early afternoon. Due to the long day light hours in the summer of Alaska, we made it back before it was getting dark.  The trail is not easy but manageable. Our 9 to 13 year-old kids and their 75 year-old grandma made all the way to the ice field. The first part was hot. The middle part was hard since some of the large rocks were hard to climb for a young kid and elder. The last part was easy but cold. So dress in layers and bring enough water and some snacks. The view was changing along the way which was absolutely mesmerizing. The view at the ice field was breathtaking. We spent a couple of hours at the top. Along the trail, we saw a lot of mountain goats and had two close encounters with two black bears. Each time, the bear just run away.  The hiking experience and the breathtaking views are worth all efforts. Definitely a must if your family enjoy hiking."
Kenai Fjords National Park,Alaska (AK),Exit Glacier,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Unmatched Beauty and Awesomeness!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited the Exit Glacier both on our own and on a guided tour - I recommend BOTH! The adults in our group first visited Exit and hiked up to Marmot Meadows, then went off trail a bit to get a better view of the glacier. Be aware of your surrounding and safety to know when you are getting into dangerous territory (too close to the glacier and the sliding rocks), but it's worth the trek. The hike up is definitely physically trying and I'd recommend taking hiking poles - we didn't have them and would have liked to, especially if we'd gone up further. We happened to visit on a day that was dry, and it was gorgeous, but still a bit slippery."

Trail includes one stream crossing on a plank, however depending on time of year may be underwater.  Stone steps for the steep sections should be used with caution; children need supervision.  Glacier has receded dramatically, but the hike was worth the effort."

We hiked the Glacier Overlook Loop Trail with a total distance of approximately 2 miles. The first half of the trail going up is easy but the second half of the ascent is more challenging, particularly when the rocky ground is wet. We were very happy to have mosquito spray with us. The mosquitoes are large and aggressive. The blue color of the glacier is cool and I recommend the trip."

But it was as much fun this time around as it was back then. You have to walk a little further to see the glacier now, but it actually makes for a nice hike. We went to the Overlook and then hiked down to the outwash plain and walked along the river towards the glacier which was really nice.  Very scenic and easy hike, if you’re in the area you shouldn’t miss this."

This area is known as the Ocotillo Patch. An informational kiosk provides information on the Ocotillo Fouquieria splendens plant that grows abundantly in the area. This plant is not a cactus, but a bush that can grow up to thirty-five feet tall. To the casual observer this plant is a large pile of dead sticks. This dramatically changes when rain hits the area. Brillant crimson flowers appear on each stem and a plethora of bees abound near each blossom, The branch is covered with thorns that will provide painful inflictions to your skin if you happen to get pricked. Unfortunately, no blossoms, just a lot of dead look sticks on this trip. Still an interest facet of Southern California environmental diversity to observe."

It is a giant turtle. “Murtle the Turtle” is the world’s largest replica of a tortoise. This larger that live sculpture is a beautiful recreation of the desert tortoise which one dominated the landscape in this area. During the 1950 – 1960s, Joshua Tree use to hold an annual Turtle Day Parade and Turtle Races to honor this magnificent creature. Over the years, this reptile started to disappear from the surrounding landscape. Eventually it was declared an endanger species, and Joshua Tree gave up their Turtle Day Parade and Races. To honor this tradition and the tortoise, Joshua Tree designed a statue using a concept taken from a 1957 painted plaster turtle parade float. Hence the birth of “Murtle the Turtle.”  Over the years, time and weather played havoc with this rendition of the Turtle and it was replaced with the current sculpture. Outstanding sculpture to honor a past tradition and a beautiful creature. Well worth a visit."

If you love crocheted and/or knit animals this is the place for you!  It is a bit difficult to find, but if you drive behind the Joshua Tree Saloon (easy to find) there it is, in an outrageous color of green, and it might be the smallest museum you'll ever visit.  The key is in the door, just turn the key and enter!  There is a donation box to the right to give a donation.  The building is jam packed with big and small animals all either crocheted or knit.  Upon leaving the museum, I met the owner, a fun young lady from the Art Queen store next door.  She does not crochet, but she started collecting the poodles and all went wild after that.  The museum is the most wild and crazy thing I have seen in a long time and all I could do is laugh and giggle and take lots of pictures!

There is a lot of info, books, internet, etc to plan a trip.  If hiking take a hiking poles,  they were most helpful."

Joshua Tree,California (CA),Joshua Tree National Park,National Parks,5.0,Well worth the drive from Palm Springs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are coming from Palm Springs for a day trip, I would come in from the north which seemed to be the most striking part of the park. I might go to Twentynine Palms for lunch, come in that gate and go out the west gate. The route to I-10 is very long and takes you through vast expanse of desert as you transition from the high Mojave Desert to the low Colorado Desert. The Joshua trees are in the northern part of the park, as well as the most interesting granite rock formations. The park was busy even on a weekday. The line backed up at noon at the west gate so they just let a lot of cars through and requested you pay on the exit. That meant you did not get the park map before entering which was a great disadvantage. I would not recommend going here without some literature like that. It allows you to judge where to stop and what sort of features or hike lay ahead. Like all parks it is expensive, $30 per car or $20 for a senior one year pass. It is definitely one of the more memorable parks I have been to. It is nice going during the winter season when the temperatures are manageable."

We drove from Palm Springs, which took about an hour.  When we arrived, they were supposed to charge us an entrance fee, but they were only stopping the members to show their badge.  The person told navigating traffic told us to pay on the way out.  So, we entered and immediately stopped at the restrooms and checked out the routes and maps.  We drove slowly through like everyone else.  It was especially great to see when we did because there was snow all over the place.  It was so peaceful, tranquil and beautiful. There is nothing like it in the world.  We spent a good hour driving through, stopping to look and take pictures and then exiting. We had expected to pay when we were exiting, but they were not monitoring the exit since so many cars were coming in the entrance.  We felt guilty for not paying, but had to keep moving. This is such a special place and everyone, no matter what age, should check it out."

Joshua Tree,California (CA),Joshua Tree National Park,National Parks,5.0,Beautiful park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went to Joshua tree for three days and LOVED it. We were there over break (dec 29-31) so the park was crowded, but for the most part we didn't feel it. One thing that really helped that I would recommend is going to the ranger station before going into the park and asking them about where to go. The ranger we spoke to was friendly and suggested some hikes that were more off the beaten path (but still beautiful/fun) so that we weren't in places that were mobbed. There are lots of hikes of varying lengths/difficulty that aren't on the map of the park that they give you-so it's worth it to ask. If hiking isn't your thing, there are lots of short walks or sites you can basically just drive to as well. We did 2 intense hiking days and one laid back chill day in the park. Bring layers and food since you can't get it in the park (although there are cute restuarants in Joshua tree the town where we stayed- highly recommend)."
Joshua Tree,California (CA),Joshua Tree National Park,National Parks,5.0,My Favorite Place so Far! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Before this trip I had seen so many photos of the Joshua Trees and thought they're beautiful! When I was planning my trip, I had to decide between JTNP and another place, and oh boy, am I glad I chose JTNP! The Joshua Trees are even more beautiful in person than on photos! There are so many beautiful sights aside from that, and so many great hiking trails. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves hiking. I would recommend at least 3 days at the park (that wasn't enough for me). And I would recommend not just driving through and seeing what's along the road, because the deeper you go, the more beauty you see!"

The incline isn't too bad, but if you have weak knees or a heart condition you may not want to hike this trail.  Dress in layers.  At the lower part of the trail it was warmer, at times it got colder and once the fog rolled in, we needed our fleece jackets.  Bring a rain jacket just in case.  Take water and a light snack.  There are no bathroom facilities here but there is a day area just before it.  "

My wife and I are not avid hikers, but this trail was relatively manageable and mostly shaded.  We were there midday, so we did not see many birds, but did see several pheasants.  There are restrooms nearby and the road goes on to Mauna Loa Trail (but we did not go there, so I cannot comment about that experience).  All together it was a great way to spend about an hour!"

We originally thought it was accessible from within the park but then found you have to go back to the main road and drive about 5 miles to get to entrance but it was well worth it.  The walk is peaceful, easy -- even for seniors - and includes informative signage along the way about what you are seeing. It includes the history of the park - which was grasslands for cows 100 years ago and has been returned to it natural state, by removing all non native plants and as many of the animals as possible. The result is an incredible tropical forest, full of birds and native plants, with lots of information on the history of the park and the efforts that have been made to preserve it. Quite an incredible story."

Please don't pick them up since that is the ranger's job.  Just enjoy the ability to photograph them up close.  There are benches where true bird watchers (not us) can sit to search for the numerous birds we heard but could only catch glimpse of."

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Pu'u Huluhulu trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Amazing views, great signage",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This review is for the Pu'u Huluhulu trail nd the trail leading to  the Pu'u Huluhulu trail.  We really enjoyed this hike. Our Uncle and Aunty took us on this hike, they are Volcano residents.  We got the enhanced tour from them, but even if you don't have a local tour guide like we did, the trail that leads you to the Pu'u Huluhulu trail has trail markers and excellent foliage signage.  The signs show a cartoonish drawing of the plant being described along with a short description and often times cultural information for the plant.  Dress in layers.  Parts of the trail we were cold, part of the trail we felt very hot and although it didn't rain for us, there are times it does rain in Volcano.  Because we love photography, we stopped at each plant to take photos.  The round trip hike including a 15 minute rest at the last lookout took almost 3 hours.  "
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Pu'u Huluhulu trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,A pretty fun trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the lesser known and lesser travelled trails in the park, and while it doesn't have the ""Wow"" factor of Kilauea Iki or Crater Rim Trail, it's definitely still worth your time. You start off crossing a lava flow, then there's a short change of scenery when you go through a small/sparse forest area with lava trees and formations, and then it really opens up to a large lava field before getting to the cinder cone. You ascend the cinder cone for about 15-20 minutes before getting to the top, where you are rewarded with great views of Mauna Loa (on a clear day) and Pu'u O'o in the opposite direction. You can't see Pu'u O'o very clearly from the top due to the trees, but fortunately there's a small trail detour right before you reach the top where you can walk out to a nice overlook for a fantastic view of it.  This trail took me about an hour and a half to hike roundtrip, and it's a great way to stretch your legs and have a quiet hike with not many other hikers to share it with (There were only two other people hiking when I went). I remember hiking this trail when I was a kid, and knew that I wanted to do it again as an adult. It's really not a very popular trail (I had to actually ask around about it, describing it as I remembered as a child), as it's not in any of the guide books that I had at the time of my vacation.  Absolutely worth the time it takes to hike it. The only reason I'm giving it a 4-star rating instead of 5 is because it's just not as awesome and interesting as Kilauea Iki.  Not everything can be Kilauea Iki, so I would actually recommend doing this trail first, because it's hard to follow up Kilauea Iki Trail with anything besides Halemaumau Trail which is currently closed due to the current eruption."

There is a guidebook optional for $2 at a ranger kiosk. Totally worth it, really well written about the geography, history, plants and animals of the park and this area. Beautiful views from the end of the trail at top of Puu Huluhulu. Listen to the Amakihi in the Ohia trees singing as they collect Lehua blossom nectar. Take water and hats and good shoes. Fun hike, glad itis open. "
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Pu'u Huluhulu trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Amazing Hike ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Excellent choice for a Volcanoes Park hike if you have a few hours (we took 3). You are exposed on a lava field for much of the hike, so be sure to bring sun protection and plenty of water. The trail was marked through the lava fields with rock cairns, and they were well maintained and easy to follow. Buy the trail guidebook at the trailhead for some interesting history and geology. Beautiful views from the top as well; we were able to see Pu'u O'o erupting in the distance."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Pu'u Huluhulu trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"To avoid getting lost, take Naupu Trailhead",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'm glad to see we're not the only people that started this trail where the trailhead is located and wound up lost, wandering around a lava field for 20 minutes. This lava field looks the same in every direction and if we didn't have a mountain to our right, I don't know if we would have found our way out. So this is not a review of the hike, but instead a tip for everyone who does this hike: DO NOT START AT THE MAUNA ULU/PU'U HULUHULU TRAILHEAD! START AT THE NAPAU TRAILHEAD! Both trails start at the same place and the Mauna Ulu/Pu'u Huluhulu trail is part of the Napau Trail. To get to the trailhead for both, follow the Chain of the Craters road to the Mauna Ulu parking area at the end of a short spur road between the 3 and 4 mile markers. The spur road dead-ends into a small parking area and both trailheads are a very short walk straight ahead from the parking area. You will encounter a sign (pic attached) that points the way to both trailheads as well as the way to a very short trail that shows the aftermath of the Mauna Ulu eruption. You walk just a little ways more and you'll encounter another sign that, unfortunately, I did not get a picture of. This sign will show the Naupu trail starting to your right and the Mauna Ulu/Pu'u Huluhulu trail straight ahead. Almost everything you find on this trail will tell you to follow the cairns and there are 2 cairns that lead straight ahead so for a couple minutes you'll think you're on the right path. You're not. If you're traveling parallel to the mountain on your right with a large bank of trees to your left, you're going the wrong way. If you are stepping on a lot of shaky, rocky lava and cannot make out a clear walking path, you're going the wrong way. You want to take a right at the trailhead where it indicates the start of the Naupu trail, walking towards that large mountain with the bank of trees to your back. The trail is a very clear walking path marked with little numbered posts and a lot of cairns so once you get on it, it's very easy to follow. The trick is getting on it to begin with."

Get the trail guide for $2 at the start to learn about what you're walking through, makes it much more interesting. You follow piles of stacked rocks for the trail, thought I'd point that out as a few people bailed on the trail saying that it was difficult to follow. It's really easy to follow if you know to look for the rock stacks."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Pu'u Huluhulu trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Wonderful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail was recommended by our lodge owner and we are so happy we took his advice. Very lightly traveled and not so well marked this trail was perfect for our family of 5 -- all adults. I'd call it a moderate hike of about 3.5 miles round trip. Stick it out till you reach the photo platform at the crater -- from there you can see 2 volcanoes and the sea. Amazing view.

It was an 1hr at a leisurely pace total. Great views over the park. The other trails aren't open so this is as much exploring as you can get. If we were more prepared we'd take the longer trail out to the further crater. Great mix of rocks and plants.

I would not say this walk was easy, and you definitely need tennis or hiking shoes since you are climbing up and down rocks of all sizes.  But the path is laid out well, with beautiful wildflowers and a vast area of quiet surrounding you.  It took us 20-30 minutes each way.  The visitors center at the Volcano park was pouring rain, so we were so thankful to find a trail at the southern tip of the park which was completely dry and warm.  Highly recommend!"

The trail was longer then expected, but it was nice to see some of the old lava flow up close. The trail was flat for the most part but rocky in parts, so definitely prepare. Once at the petroglyphs there is a boardwalk around them so visitors don't walk over them. I found the petroglyphs to be in good condition and fun to look at. There are a few signs on the route explaining the history of the people and how they survived off the land.

Trail well marked.  The petroglyphs were a bit of a disappointment. I expected thousands easily viewed.  It was raining, so we did not stay at the board walk to really search for them.  the rain interfered with visibility as well. The guide books made this seem like they place to see petroglyphs. We did not do the trails in Kohala as a result.  Oh well.  Also, it is a 30 minute drive from the top of the park, so if you have limited time, I would chose another trail."

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Pu'u Loa Petroglyphs,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.0,Challenging walk for seniors ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We heard this was interesting stop on the Chain of Craters Road. The “trail” is very rough over many boulders and only roughly marked. It is over a mile round trip and it is quite warm here (4000 feet below main Park). The petroglyphs were moderately interesting but frankly I would not do again. We are 70 in good health/shape but it was a bit of struggle.

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kalapana,Neighborhoods,4.5,Where Fire and Water Collide,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After spending a few hours exploring Volcanoes National Park, we wanted to see some lava where it entered the ocean at the Kamukona ocean entry. There are 2 choices by land. View it from the west by heading to the end of Chain of Craters Rd, approximately 45 minute drive from the Visitors Center. Once you reach the Holei Sea Arch you have a 4.1 mile hike that will take 1.5 - 2 hours to reach the viewing area. The other choice is to view it from the east by leaving the park and head east on Hwy 11, then down Hwy 130 to Kalapana. From there it's 4.6 miles to the viewing area but you can rent a bike whereas in the park you cannot. We decided that riding a bike was a better option. Also if you want to see the orange glow from the lava, you should time it when the sun sets; around 6pm in the winter. Although you can see some glow during daylight, it's much more impressive when the sun is down and viewing from the east allows you to watch the sun set behind the ocean entry."

Now!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you want to see lava pouring into the ocean in the most impressive display, get yourself to the Kalapana viewing platform NOW!! We went on February 7th after being turned away due to vog the night before. We are so glad we tried again and so glad we made the 6 mile journey by bike. Took my 8 & 10 yo boys. We rented bikes once we got there, around 4:30. Bike ride is not too difficult but there are some rolling hills. Once we got there at dusk, we were rewarded with one of the most speculative sights of Mother Nature ever. We stayed till dark and rode back in the warm rain, which was also a very cool experience. Save yourself hundreds the boat tours cost - we saw the boats and they didn't get any closer than we did for a fraction of the cost ($20 vs $250) and a little exercise (which was cool, biking through a lava field on a gravelly road). Call this number before you go, around 3pm, to get the latest info as Pele (and the lava flow) changes her plans constantly - 808-430-1966. The rangers at the visitor centre didn't give us the most accurate info as the entrance to Kalapana is outside the Park. Make the time, do this while you still can. Bring binoculars. You will not regret it!! And these pictures don't do it justice. It's just something you HAVE to experience in person!"
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kalapana,Neighborhoods,4.5,Glowing lava,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went to the Kalapana Village site in the late afternoon, and spent the evening there as well. You drive to the end of Hwy 130, and then continue along a more narrow road until you reach a parking lot. From there, it's only a short walk (5-10 minutes) to the ""end"" of the road -- created by lava! The hike used to go a lot further in, but recent lava flows have cut it shorter. The road leading there is all paved, no hoofing it over lava -- so you don't need to dress for a major hike, but sneakers or sport hiking shoes are a good idea. So are binoculars, flashlights, & a good camera! A couple of attendants stationed at the end provided information about recent lava activity. The lava hadn't yet reached the ocean at the time we were there, but the hillside was smoking -- as it got dark, bright orange spots could be seen. "
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kalapana,Neighborhoods,4.5,Highlight of our trip!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"From Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, we drove about 40 minutes to Kalapana and rented some beat-up bikes and flashlights for $15 per person.  We biked a mile or so to the hiking spot and hiked an hour and a half towards the big lava flow that we can see from afar.  We thought we were close but we kept on hiking and asking others who would say, you are an hour away, or 30 minutes away from it.  We hiked on crispy lava.  We knew we were close when we felt the heat suddenly approach and we can see fire underneath the lava rocks we are walking on.  It was scary because that ground is unstable.  There's no set boundaries and you can get as close as you want to the flowing lava.  The lava viewing area was quite crowded and amazing to see but we didn't see anyone staying too long.  There's no trail markers so we were following people's flashlights."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kalapana,Neighborhoods,4.5,Detailed overview of our most memorable lava experience ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We went twice! The first time we walked in and then spent the evening viewing the lava water entry point and the night stars.  The second time we biked in and hiked to the flowing lava.  So here's our assessment of both trips:
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Volcano Art Center Gallery,Art Galleries,4.5,Driving down route 11 we came across the Volcano Art Center Gallery located Fine collection of real local artists works.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Driving down route 11 we came across the Volcano Art Center Gallery located in the old 1877 Hotel for the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, at Kilauea. Which according to the local people is home to Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of the volcano, creativity, and Fire.  The Art Center Gallery is an interesting collection of over 200 local artists, displaying everything from jewelry to pottery to paintings. As you approach the front door there is a very well stocked Tourist information rack. Upon entering you are faced by a large wooden snake’s head carving, by the information counter is an interesting painting of a Hawaiian lady dancing. There are also various paintings of the volcanos eruptions near the display case showing locally made jewelry. This is not really the place to buy tourist trinkets, but if you are looking for something different to take home you may will find it here.   "

The artists who are shown here, are world class.  The textile products are gorgeous….I bought many runners here, because they are artistic and add a fine Hawaiian sense to my home.  In addition to many forms of art, they have jewelry, notepads, books and unique gift items.  "
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Volcano Art Center Gallery,Art Galleries,4.5,Had To Stop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We had to stop to see what this was like. It is in the old Hotel that was built in 1887 so I wanted to see that. There are many pieces of artwork by local artists. Saw some nice things that I would like to have but our house has no room left to put anything more up on the walls unless we get rid of something else.

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Holei Sea Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,End of the Drive,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the endpoint for the Chain of Craters Road. It’s a .2 mile walk to a viewpoint which looks back into an eroded sea stack much in the distance. Living in Northern California, I did not find it to be anything special or unique. But, it is a small investment for those who don’t live near to the ocean. At least, it was better weather down along the coast!"
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Holei Sea Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Laughable. I didn’t even see it at all until my husband insistently pointed at it. Do not bother,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"You really DO NOT want to drive one hour and then walk 2 miles under the scorching sun to realize that the attraction you came for does not exist anymore. That’s right, the lava interrupting the road has been excavated, and no one had bothered to notify tourists, so when you get to the parking lot after driving south one hour to see just this you will walk on a concrete road for a good 25 minutes and then find a pebble road and keep walking for another 15 minutes before realizing that this road is endless because it’s the highway being rebuilt, and the government torn down the tourist attraction you have been seeking. I think it’s outrageous how little respect the government of Hawaii shows tourists given its their major form of income, considering there is no signage alerting people of closures and length of trails, no signal so it’s impossible to call anybody in case of an emergency and it’s incredibly hard to find the points of interests. My husband and I have visited most national parks in the US and the volcano park in big island is by far the most disappointing and less worth it if national parks. The Holei sea arch is laughable. The “scenic drive” looks exactly like all the rest of the island. The services offered are terrible. It’s hard even to find gas so make sure you don’t find yourself stranded mid-park. Horrible. I will never ever be coming back."

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Holei Sea Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Worth the drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It takes about 45 minutes to drive from the visitor center to the end of the Chain of Craters Road where the arch is. But more than likely, you are going to drive at least part of the road to get to the popular lava tubes so the extra time required to drive out and back isn't that bad. When you get to the end, you still have a 10 minute walk to get to the viewing platform. You aren't that close to the arch but I could use the zoom on my iPhone for some pretty decent pics."

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Holei Sea Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Interesting Scenery at the end of the Chain of Craters Road,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Holei Sea Arch is at the end of the Chain of Craters Road.  The drive ends at a parking area with toilets amongst the lava flows at the edge of the shore.  There is a short walk to the area where you are allowed to walk out to a spot overlooking the shore, with the waves crashing against the lava-rock cliff.   Along it is the Holei Sea Arch.  It is fairly small and not easy to get a good picture of since the current viewing area is not that close to the arch itself. The Chain of Craters Road has, in the decades since built, been several times closed or partly closed due to lava flows, and the older viewing area remains can be seen on the walk, having been largely destroyed by lava."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Holei Sea Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Wow!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice parking area. Short walk to view the sea arch. Bathrooms on site.

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Holei Sea Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Worth the Drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We thought that the Holei Sea Arch was the best part of the Chain of Craters Road.  It is really quite a spectacular ending to this scenic road.  There is a short walk of about 1000 feet from the parking area at the end of the road to the viewpoint.  It's worth the walk.

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Holei Sea Arch,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,It’s the Journey not the Destination,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Holei Sea Arch itself is a disappointment, but the trip to it is about the journey not the destination.  You can find the arch and take its picture in about 5 minutes.  But the changing terrain as you drive to the coast and the coast itself are both beautiful.  Once there, be sure to get out and walk on the lava cover, examine it and appreciate its various textures, etc.  There is also considerable bright green succulent ground cover that can offer wonderful contrast to the coal black cinders and bright blue ocean for some creative photo ops.  Also, you should find nene there.  They are Hawaii's state bird, and beautiful goose-like birds that offer great photo opportunities."

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Nahuku - Thurston Lava Tube,Geologic Formations,4.5,Don't Miss the Lava Tube,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I've never seen a lava tube until visiting Hawaii. I went into one in Hilo and Thurston Lava Tube. I actually preferred the lava tube in Hilo but recommend visiting Thurston when visiting Volcanoes National Park. I really enjoyed the rainforest walk before getting to the lava tube. Once inside the lava tube it was a quick walk to the end. It was a fun and interesting walk through the tube. I'd do it again!

The parking area for the tubes is fairly small and cars will block the road as they wait for a spot. Going early (before 11) or later (after 3) as you come back from touring the Chain of Craters Road should get you a spot in the parking lot.

Keep in mind that if you do try to park there and can’t, you will need to keep driving for around another mile until you can safely turn around.  And on the way back, barriers prevent you from taking any spot that may have opened up."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Nahuku - Thurston Lava Tube,Geologic Formations,4.5,Very impressive view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a very impressive view from inside a lava tube. You don’t need to bring your own flashlight during the day, the cave is lit up.  You don’t have to worry if you are claustrophobic; it’s a vast opening. Parking is iffy. They have overflow parking at the stop before and from there it is a nice little hike to the cave. Also no time limit for parking in this lot where as next to the tube it’s 30 minutes. If you are impressed and have the time also visit Kaumana Caves"
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Nahuku - Thurston Lava Tube,Geologic Formations,4.5,"Wet, but worth it",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a really wet hike. Be aware that you are pretty much in a rainforest going into a cave. So the wet drippy feeling is unavoidable. Your shoes will get wet. The Tube itself is not all that exciting, but the beautiful foliage on the walk down and back up was worth the work out. FYI if you are not in great shape, there is a small parking area at the Tube trail. But the map and signs tell you to park about a mile back. The walk is nice and pretty, but for an overweight middle aged flip flop wearing person, it got to be too much."

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kilauea,Volcanos,4.5,Fascinating and fun,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fascinating place and fascinating views! A lot can be done with a car driving around. Definitely recommend first stopping at the visitor center, take pictures of the suggested spots listed on the boards. Also children can get the junior ranger book and earn badges if they complete some pages. Take hat, sunglasses and sunscreen. Sneakers are sufficient for walking around the park but boots are better if planning to climb on the lava rocks. We liked calling out for the echo at Pauahi crater. The drive to the sea arches. There is a shop at kilaueau military camp."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kilauea,Volcanos,4.5,Can't drive there now,5.0 of 5 bubbles,40 years ago I was here with my wife and we actually were able to see lava flowing. Not this time the volcano has stopped erupting. The old road around the caldera is no longer there. When the eruptions stopped the caldera dropped in and expanded to about two time the diameter that it was before. Check the video at the visitors center to see what happened during the eruption and especially at hte end of it.

The steam vents, the lava tubes, very cool.  But currently, the crater has nothing but steam coming out.  So we ‘had’ to stay until dark to see the lava glow.  So we waited. And waited. And waited.  Finally it got dark there it was, a glow.  No lava, but a glow, in the distance.  A guy in another party said, ‘for all we know there’s a guy down there with an orange flashlight!’  He was right, it was nothing.  And then, I still had a drive of an hour and a half back to our room.  I’m saying go to the park. But the crater is a dud."

But that steam, low clouds, and the fact that I was there an hour and a half before sunset made it hard to find the spurting lava.

I'm so glad we did it! It was fantastic. You start at the rim and walk through the rainforest, then down to the crater and across the ""lava lakebed"". You can see up close how the lava cooled, buckled, sprayed. There are still a few steam vents you can walk to, and the neat stacked-rock cairns that mark the way."

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kīlauea Iki Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Memorable Crater Hike ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of our favorite hikes we did while exploring Volcano National Park. It’s amazing to be able to hike down to the crater and walk across it. I recommend starting on the right side of the trail and going counter clockwise, we didn’t do this and it made it much harder to follow the markers on the crater. This is a 4 mile loop trail. We wore tennis shoes which were just fine for us but make sure you take plenty of water. I would also recommend going earlier in the day to avoid the heat as the crater part of the trail has no shade, but you do hike through the rainforest to get down and then again to come back up. This is a must hike while visiting the park!"
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kīlauea Iki Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Unique experience and one highlight of our trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fairly easy hike for young and old - tennis shoes, sunglasses, light jacket in case of rain, and a bottle of water and you're all set. I recommend starting on the right side of the trail and going counter clockwise, we didn’t do this and it made it much harder to follow the markers on the climb back up. Either way works though. Very little elevation change ~400 ft. We went on an overcast day so it was very comfortable - I can imagine a sunny day could get quite hot down there."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kīlauea Iki Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Worth Waking Up Early For,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great easy hike and a definite highlight of Volcanoes National Park! I started the hike around 7 AM and was the only person on the trail until the very end. Highly recommend starting as early as possible (especially if you're staying in Volcano) to avoid the crowds and the heat. Walking across the crater is surreal and gives you a whole new perspective on the size and power of volcanoes. As others have mentioned, follow the stacks of rocks placed along the crater to find the trail on the other side."

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kīlauea Iki Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Walk across what's left of the 1959 lava lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This travel can be circumnavigated in either direction. We read its best to hike counter-clockwise, and yet we were disoriented and followed the trail clockwise. Doesn't matter. Coming from Colorado, hiking a nearly 4-mile trail at 4000 ft through forest and caldera was not particularly difficult. There are somewhat steep, but shaded steps carved into the first mile or so of the trail, with 15 markers (be sure to grab the corresponding booklet at the visitor center) along the path describing flora, fauna, and volcano attributes (e.g., crater rim, steam vents, lava lake migrations). The center mile takes you into and eventually out of the caldera, which is hot, dusty and often uneven. The final mile or so returns you to the shaded forest area above the 1959 lava lake (it took 30 years to cool!) with railroad tie steps and exposed root pathways."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kīlauea Iki Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Pretty Tiring Hike,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"You better be in the mood for some exercise if you take this trail. Demanding, takes at least 2 hours, and once you’ve hiked about 25% of it, it becomes the same thing over and over. Too bad there is no way to abbreviate it, because 1/4 of the hike would be very cool, but the whole thing becomes punishing. You are going 400 feet down (equivalent to a 40 story building) on switchback trails, and then a long walk across the crater, and then climbing 400 feet back up (like climbing 40 flights of stairs). This is old lava, so your aren’t going to see any actual volcanic activity. At one place we stuck our hands in and you could feel some hot air coming out, but there isn’t any steam or gases or anything like that. It would be nice if someone dropped you off at the Thurston Lava Tube and then picked you up at the Visitor Center or the parking lot and you could at least cut off a little of the distance."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Kīlauea Iki Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Beautiful hike. Must do if you are in the Big Island,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Its a long hike but definitely worth it. For the hike, you need to be in decent physical shape but not necessarily in great shape.  The path is steep. It took us about an hour to go down the base of the crater and come back up. Along the way, you will find amazing plants. I will strongly recommend to not rush it and take in the scenery. The hike is beautiful. "
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Volcanos,4.5,Amazing place to visit and explore!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were taken here on a tour called the Hawaii Volcano Park Shared Shore Excursion by the owner, Gil.  Please note that you are taken up to the mountain, and I believe the elevation was around 4000 feet.  The temperature up there was about 58 degrees around 9am.  We came unprepared as that is a bit chilly for us.  Our tour guide had extra jackets and could not be more thankful.  I highly recommend having someone very familiar with the park drive you around.  I would have easily lost my sense of direction there.  Find a steam vent and stand next to it.  It feels like if you are in a sauna.  Feels great when it's chilly.  When we were there, it was rather drizzly, so pack a rain jacket or umbrella to be safe.  So many great things to see.  Our guide was showing us lots of places where lava had flowed and stayed with some flows from the mid 1970's.  It was a neat place to see given our limited time on the island because of our cruise."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Volcanos,4.5,Excellent despite ...,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is still an excellent experience, despite a number of changes and closures within the park that have occurred over the past couple of years.  It was of added interest to see the changes in the park since the last eruptions.  We drove around from Kona, so it was a full day trip, and we had a great time.  The weather was perfect, and we had a really lucky day finding parking spots that just seemed to open up whenever we needed one - makes for a pretty stress free day when you’re in the midst of the large number of people that visit the park every day.  The ranger staff were very helpful and informative.  The Chain of Craters drive is well worth the time it takes to drive to the end and back.  My only grumble about the whole process is that you are required to purchase a seven day pass for $30 to get into the park.  I can appreciate that lots of people come back over several days, but it would be nice to have the option of just purchasing admission for a single day."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Volcanos,4.5,Plenty to experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Volcanoes NP is stunning even in its starkness.  Easy to access from Hilo on down while a drive from the north and west sections of the island.  We had the benefit of a lifetime NPS pass so we didn't have to worry of how we necessarily needed to use our time as we didn't have to visit only once.  It is great to just pull off at one of the wide-enough areas and go exploring.  Of course one needs to be careful as the territory undulates and the lava rock is sharp.  The Nahuku-Thurston Lava Tubes were closed during our visit in November 2019 which was unfortunate but we did access the one at Bird Park though it is not recommended you do so.  The Holei Sea Arch is a sight to behold as the ocean crashes against the cliffs. Check out the designs in the smooth lava as you traverse down to the cliff tops overlooking the ocean. Take the time here, since you are parked, to continue on the gravel path and walk to the lava flow that you can walk on as it seems to go on forever.  On the way back on Chain of Craters Rd if you're up to another trek over and around rocks and boulders check out the Pu'u Loa Petroglyphs.  Here on an elevated boardwalk you will see these ancient artworks, unfortunately, you will also see some vandalizing as well.  We came back another day to visit the Visitors Center, the Steam Vents and the Steaming Bluff.  These areas were much more crowded.  If you drove here you can pick up gas in the Kilauea Military Camp where their gas prices are excellent and only bettered by the Costco in Kona.  We did not venture on any trails and certainly there is much more that could be explored.  We hope to be back for more adventure."
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Volcanos,4.5,Holy Glow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I don't think you need to read reviews of the park itself.. so instead I will give you tips.  We did the unthinkable and got up in the middle of the night to make it to the view spot for lava by 4:30am.  We saw the glow and the sunrise with only a handful of people.  Dress warm it is cold and windy and may rain. It is a easy one mile hike to the viewing rimj.  We then basically had the park to ourselves until around 9am when it got a bit busier.  We hiked a total of 12 miles on various trails.  If you do what I suggest and go before sunrise do dress in layers because by 11am you will start to get warm.  My favorite trail was Kilauea iki trail which takes you around the crater and then down and across the bottom of it.  Bring a hat and plenty of water because if the sun is not covered by clouds it will get toasty.  We also drove the chain of Craters down to the sea.  The sea arch is OK  very windy and you can only view from a distance.  The petroglyph trail was also nice but walking over all that lava and in the wind is exhausting.  After we felt we saw all there was we then went to Kona for the afternoon.  We picked up dinner and headed back to the volcano for a sunset and night glow sighting ( since we were staying in KONA) We parked in the closest lot to walk to the lava viewing (can't remember the name) we got there around 6 pm ( the sun set around pm)  the parking lots started to fill up fast.  We ate dinner in the car then walked to the area for sunset.  I was shocked at the throngs of people already there.  We stayed for about an hour 8pm had our fill and left.  I totally would recommend doing the EARLY 4am view instead of the night time.  You don't have the crowds of people then you have the rest of your day for the park then drive to the black sand beach and take a nap!.
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Hawaii (HI),Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,Volcanos,4.5,No red glow from the lava lake; visitor center museum closed.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We drove 2+ hours from Kona to see the visitor center (during daylight hours) and the red glow from the lava after sunset.  Sunset happens around 6:30 PM.  The rangers told us that the best viewing was at the end of the road.  Since that is where most people head, there was a traffic jam with the park rangers directing traffic.  We waited (on the main road) about 20 minutes before we were allowed into the parking lot (where another ranger directed us to an open parking spot).  We walked the short distance to the crater's edge.  We did NOT see any red glow in the sky (steam or clouds), just some white and gray.  We were disappointed.  When we were here in 2014, we saw lots of red.  Looking at the NPS webcam of the crater, one can see that there is not much red on the lava lake."

My wife wanted to see the petroglyphs near the end of that 16 mile drive dropping a few thousand feet (good road but definitely hold the wheel with both hands!). We'd read there was a boardwalk to the site but when arriving found out it was a .7 mile walk through a fairly rigorous lava boulder path.  About .5 mile in my wife lost her footing and fell, dislocating her finger (we found that out at the ER hours later).  We were wearing non slip good shoes going very slow but highly advise anyone over 55 especially with weaker knees/hips/ankles to skip that stop and feel the park service needs to better advise only experienced hikers to do this one.  The rest of the park was interesting but this wrecked our experience, what could have been one of our highlights to a multi week island visit."
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Supply Trail,Hiking Trails,4.0,So much to see,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trailhead for the supply trail is accessed from a small parking lot just outside the Hosmer Grove campground. A visit to the campground for a pre-hike rest stop is a good idea as there are no restrooms at the trailhead or along the trail. This is a 4.6 mile round trip hike through native sub-alpine scrub land. The trail is classed as moderate to strenuous by the park due to the distance and an elevation gain of 1,000 feet. We had the trail to ourselves for most of the day. The trail provides views of the park, the Maui coastline and a variety of plants and birds. The trail ends where it meets the more popular Halemau'u Trail. You could turn around here but you would miss out on a couple of spectacular views. Turn left onto the Halemau'u Trail and just a short distance beyond you arrive at the blown out side of the massive crater and 1000 ft. cliff with great views of the valley and coastline below. A short distance further you look into the crater and get a very different perspective than you get from the summit area. We highly recommend this trail."

Loads of fog and cloud cover that obscured the view. Also the trail was pretty steep with lots of rocky steps, uneven for the first stretch up to the crater viewpoint.

The road to Hana contains so many great waterfalls that you can get up close to.  Why drive the extra miles of narrow, poorly maintained road to Oheo just to walk along manicured paths that keep you far away from nature?  Yeah, the sun-faded history boards about early Hawaiian culture in the area were informative, but you could get that in a book if it's really what you want.  If you want waterfalls and pools then use the time to pull off the Road to Hana once or twice more and go see some of the (free) ones there.  And if you were smart enough to stay overnight at Hana, then use your second morning to visit Red Sands or Venus Pool or the Heau and don't bother with The Seven Overhyped Pools."

Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Ohe'o Gulch,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.0,Short hike with great views for all,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail to see Ohe’o Gulch, actually called the Kuloa Point Trail, is a 1/2 mile loop trail that takes you out to where the Palikea stream meets the ocean. From there you see the mouth of the gulch with it’s surf and rocks to your right, and the Pools of Ohe’o, known as the Seven Sacred Pools, to your left. The trail leaves from the left side of the Kipahulu Visitor Center. We went counter clockwise and it is pretty level out to the point. There is a side trail that goes down along the edge of the gulch at that point, and it’s where you get your best views and pictures. Be careful at that point as it does drop off. The views here are great. We continued following the trail in the same direction, heading back towards the visitor center. The 80 feet of elevation gain is obviously on this return leg. If you have any mobility limitations like my wife does, you should probably go back the way you came. She did struggle a little, whereas the other direction would have been easy.  "
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Ohe'o Gulch,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.0,Over hyped,3.0 of 5 bubbles,The Ohe’o Gulch (also called Seven Sacred Pools) is along the Kuloa Point Trail – an easy 1/2-mile loop that is partially along a stream to where major pools spill into the ocean. It was nice but not as pretty or as stunning as I'd imagined it would be.  The pools were murky from the churning of the small waterfalls. In hindsight we would have rather spent more time at other sights along the Road to Hana instead of taking time to see this.

You have to pay the National Park fees to get into this area, so that'a a consideration for some.  Overall, the beauty of the falls near the ocean we think makes these waterfalls better than some others on the Road to Hana.  The challenge is that because of all the stops on the Road to Hana, most people probably either don't get this far, or are too pooped out by this point(!)  One significant plus is this has much more extensive parking than all the other waterfalls on the way to Hana."

Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Sliding Sands Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Excellent,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Walking down here is eerie to me. First of all you're at 10000 feet so if you use the rule of thumb 1 hour down 2 hours up it is more like 3 because of the altitude unless you live in higher elevations. Make sure you have good shoes and warm clothes and a last worning don't go in the rain.  The landscape is moonlike and pretty barren. We didn't do the entire trek but did enough to know a little of what to expect. We had clear weather but it was cold. Definitely huffed and puffed on the way back up.

We weren’t able to swim or see the pools because it was raining so hard, but it was still incredible. If it’s raining, this hike is MUDDY. Plan on being disgusting, and wear tennis shoes that you do not care about. This is the last stop on the Road to Hana, so make sure you’ve allotted plenty of time to hike AND to get home (it’ll take you another 2 hours to drive back, and it’s not fun to do in the dark).

This allowed us to make the hike up the Pīpīwai Trail and see the Bamboo Forest and Waimoku Falls. The trail is a full 4 miles round trip. The payoff are the falls at the end. There are a number of scenic views that make this trek worth the effort. I would recommend this only if you are in shape as there is a lot of uphill hiking and many uneven steps. I would not recommend going if you bring young children who need to be carried. The hike is tough enough and I can’t see a parent making it up carrying a child (unless very young). Either way I suggest taking your time, take breaks when needed, and know that there are flat spots where you can catch your breath while you walk. "

You should know that if you want to do sunrise you need to make a resevation on line (it's $1) for entry between 3AM-7AM.  As the weather had been quite rainy and clouds could be seen we decided instead of waking up at an ungodly hour, traveling at least an 1 1/2  - 2 hours drive.  We went in the afternoon.  we were not disappointed.  The traffic of both cars and people were lite and we were able to see everything.  Note: there is a $30 entry fee per car and that is good for 3 day   AND gets you into the state park on the road to Hana.. so plan ahead and accordingly."

This last trip was really tough to get a reservation. They only offered a very limited about of reservations each morning and could only try to reserve it 24 hours prior. Every morning at 7a I woke up and tried to make reservations for the following day and in literally 30 seconds all of the reservations were gone.

Try to pick clear sunny weather. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We drove up 10,000 feet to arrive at the top of the Haleakalā Crater in the National Park. Do be careful at the top as the high altitude may affect you & the last steps to climb ( optional ) may make you breathy. "
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Crater,Mountains,4.5,Sunrise with poor visibility - disappointing ,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We booked at 7am when tickets went live two days before, when the forecast looked good for the sunrise trip. Left Lahaina at 3.30am. Bought coffee in Kahului (gas station) at 4.30am. When we got to the park entrance and paid our $30 we were told we couldn’t get to the top due to road conditions and we may not see the sunrise. We decided to plough on but we had to park well below the crater facing the wrong direction to see the sunrise. It was icy and cold and low cloud cover impeded visibility. We needed the restroom so we ended up going down to a lower parking area with restroom before sunrise. Nothing special about the sunrise at that level - it just got light. No colours or atmosphere. That’s the risk you take when you have to decide two days ahead."
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Crater,Mountains,4.5,Sunset Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"By the time we decided to go to Maui, it was far too late to get a reservation for sunrise so we opted to do sunset.  Since I haven't done both, I can't say how they really compare but we really loved sunset.  We love star gazing so it was probably preferable for us."
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Crater,Mountains,4.5,Sensational Sunrise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The chance to watch the sun rise above the clouds sounded like a magical experience.  I marked the date I could make a reservation to enter Haleakala National Park and snagged a reservation (and you must have one for entry).  My partner and I were lucky that the sun rises a little later at the end of November, so we left our hotel in Kihei at 3AM to give ourselves enough time to safely drive up the mountain while it was still dark.  The drive up had hairraising moments, particularly the highest sections where there weren't guardrails between the edge of the road and the mountain face.  & a tip to future drivers going up, it isn't necessary to tailgate the car(s) in front of you going at the proper speed limit and have your brights on the entire time.  You will also be charged $30 for a 3 day parking pass for Haleakala (we were visiting the other side of the park the following day, so that worked in our favor.  However, if you're only visiting once, you may need to tell them you only want a 1 day pass).  We got to the summit with 45 minutes to spare before the official sunrise but many people got there before us and we were one of the last cars to park at the summit lot.  My partner and I were able to wear our November clothes from NYC up at the summit to keep warm.  Gloves would be smart, if you're keeping your hands out on your phone/camera to capture as much as you can.  The way the light changes truly is magical, turning high and low laying clouds from shadows to shapes.  A park ranger was at the summit giving some background and did a Hawaiian sunrise chant as the sun appeared from the horizon of clouds.  It was an absolutely magical moment.  Many people appeared to leave after the sunrise, but take a few hours to hike part of the Sliding Sands Trail.  The topography really feels otherworldly.  And if you look hard enough, you can see smoke or steam coming from the tops of the cinder cones further in the valley, to remind you that Haleakala is still a live volcano.  Take your time with the hike (and bring water) as you are just under 10,000 feet above sea level and may have shortness of breath at that height.  Regardless, it's an experience like no other."
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Crater,Mountains,4.5,Watching a sunrise from the top of the world.  Haleakala Crater on Maui.  Just WOW!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a great and unique experience.  Watching the sunrise from the top of the world.  You should really do it at least once if you have the opportunity.  I try not to pass up life events that Samual Clements went out of his way to do.  Tips:  Get on National Parks website up to six months in advance to obtain a sunrise parking permit.  (Cheep, $1)  Start your drive earlier than you think you need to.  Some people are very cautious drivers and the road to the top is not designed for passing in the dark.  Also, the glow to the east starts way before the sunrise and you want to enjoy the stars from atop.  I know you didn't pack for winter so wear your whole wardrobe if you have too, plus a windbreaker, its cold.  Charge your phone or camera, you'll be snapping pictures for an hour and experimenting with the camera settings.  Stay after the sunrise, most people head back down.  I know you're tired but enjoy the National Park with the few visitors that remain and hike a little, you can always take a nap later.  If you are going to Hana, the entrance fee gets you into the Seven Sacred Pools as well.   Take your time on the drive out of the park, there are some interesting stops to explore on the way out.  I love our National Parks."
Haleakala National Park,Hawaii (HI),Haleakala Crater,Mountains,4.5,Magical moments ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sunrise or Sunset on top of the Haleakala, that was the question. I went for the sunset as you don’t need a reservation for it like you do for the sunrise. That’s how I could check how the weather was on the same day and deceive spontaneously which day to go. You want to bring warm clothes or even a blanket as it gets quite cold up there. The view is stunning and you can easily look over to Big Island from the top. After sunset you want to leave very quick as everyone starts to drive down again. "

Cataract Falls is behind the center I'd you have time for a quick hike. Parking is bad so go early or plan on circling around. They have bathrooms and bubbler there too.

There is a 20 minute video that gives you some history of the area.  They also have a great display area showing plants and critters you will find in the Smokies.  The gift shop has t-shirts, books, postcards, stickers, and a number of souvenir items.  All of this in one building and so nice.

Closest visitor center to Gatlinburg, We enjoyed the small display museum of plants and animals found in the park. The rangers were helpful. The restrooms were clean. No park movie available. A larger park store (as usual nowadays). Parking ticket kiosks are outside. You need either a $5 day pass or a $15 weekly pass. We did see the parking lot being monitored today. As noted by others and as prevalent in all areas of the park, parking can be difficult or even non-existent due to the overwhelming crowds. We took the short trail to the small Cataract Falls. Nice walk but expect that the falls are more impressive after a good rainfall. YMMV."

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Roaring Fork,Nature & Wildlife Areas,5.0,Worth the Effort,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'm not a very fit person at 67 years old. The walk was about 1 1/2 miles each way. The grade is about 7%. My wife and I walked up in about an hour and down in about 50 minutes. The trail is rough, but the falls at the end are worth every bit of time and effort. Tip: Parking is terrible. Stop at the entrance to the parking lot by the rest rooms. If you see a space, take it, if not, wait there until one opens up. The road is one-way and backing up can be problematic. Plan two-three hours depending on how many times you stop for the view (or to lower your heart beat rate). Best falls in the park. Look it up."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Mount LeConte,Mountains,5.0,Go on a clear day,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the Rainbow Falls, Mt. LeConte, Bullhead route because I hate doubling back and would rather do a loop hike. The route was about 16 miles for us and took 7 hours (plus another 30 minutes for breaks and lunch). This route was very strenuous as the first half is all uphill. Rainbow falls was very pretty and I would recommend that hike even if you weren't proceeding onto LeConte. There was a chance of rain the day we went but I was hoping the skies might clear by time we got to the summit. However, it didn't clear until we were on our return via Bullhead. So the summit itself was very disappointing. I loved the return via Bullhead which had great views. Overall, I'd recommend Rainbow Falls and Bullhead but to make it worthwhile, skip the hike if the weather is iffy."

There's a fairly primitive restroom at the trailhead and parking is at a premium. If you don't get there early, you'll have to walk to the trailhead. The hike is beautiful. The 2.3 miles to the bluff through the ""cave"" which is an awesome staircase through an opening, is easy enough until the final half mile. We tested at the bluffs before pushing on to the Leconte Lodge area before finishing the 0.2 Mike's to the cliff overlook. Every step of the 10 mile round trip was worth it. We completed the hike in 5.5 hours. "

We had Myrtle Point to ourselves for a good 15 minutes with 300 degree views from Clingmans Dome around to Pigeon Forge/Sevierville.  On a clear day I'm sure you could see to I-40 and the high mountains in NC.  Not an easy hike but anyone could do it if you're prepared and take your time.  Arch Rock and Alum Cave are good rest stops to take a break.  Get to the trailhead early.  We came on a Saturday morning and parked by 7:15 with no problem, but could see it was filling fast.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Laurel Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,"Moderate hike, beautiful forest and overlooks",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was enjoyable, and I would rate it moderate.  The trail was paved once upon a time, but weather and rain have eroded a lot of the pavement so it can be rather rugged in certain areas.  The trail is all uphill to the falls, and down on the return.  The elevation is gradual, but you do feel it.  Although several people on the trail reported seeing a bear cub run across the trail, we didn't see one.  The falls are beautiful, but sadly with so many people there we were unable to really enjoy them.  There were probably about 40 people at the upper falls and maybe 20 or more below.  This was on a Wednesday in mid-August about 1:00 pm.  On the weekend, I think the trail and falls would be a challenge if there were a lot of people.  The trail can be dangerous in places due to steep dropoffs, so be cautious.  Walking sticks are a big plus as is water and snacks.  Note that there are no restrooms or areas to sit and rest on the trail.  Allow 2 - 3 hours for the entire trail.  Parking is an issue."

We got to the trailhead early and were able to secure parking across the street from the trailhead.  We started hiking the 1.3 mile paved path to the falls.  It probably took us about 35 minutes to hike to the falls without stopping.  Once there we hung out on the wooden footbridge and then carefully navigated the rocks and dirt path down to the base of the falls below, which we had not done previously.  After hanging out for about half and hour, we decided to hike back down to the parking area.  On the way back we took our time, so it took about 40 minutes to get back down.  "

This 34 mile trip is one of the most scenic drives in America. It is the lowest drivable pass in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The road winds through the mountainous landscape featuring fragrant woodlands that include evergreen spruce, hardwoods and pine-oak while gaining over 3000 feet in elevation. Along the way there are scenic creeks & streams as well as multiple pull offs with spectacular views (picture taking paradise). You may spot wildlife along the way such as Black Bears or Wild Turkeys. We enjoyed seeing the Elk in the fields along side the Oconaluftee Visitor Center. Hiking opportunities galore including a section of the Appalachian Trail that crosses the road at Newfound Gap elevation 5046 feet and the very popular Alum Cave trail. Be prepared for the temperature change. It can vary as much as 10-12 degrees from the lowlands to Newfound Gap. We visited during the fall when the leaves were changing colors. It was fantastic. Be aware that the Great Smokey Mountains National Park is the most visited National park in the United States with over 12 million people annually and the traffic reflects that. Check your gas gauge before you enter the park. Overall we had an excellent experience. A “must do” when you visit the area."

It is only a little over 13 miles but because of the curves the turns and the stops it will take travelers over an hour from the Sugarland Visitor Center to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center an on to the Cherokee Nation and another hour to Asheville via Rt-19,  You will see streams, creaks, and different types of forest along the way. And, at Oconaluftee, you get a treat to visit the Mountain Farm Museum and the Milgus Mill."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Newfound Gap Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,This is the thing I've done the most over the years.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been going to the Smoky Mountains since I was a kid and ""driving over the mountain"" to Cherokee was what we did every visit.  There is a high probability that you will see wildlife.  The numerous pull-offs are excellent.  Following the river and seeing the water cascading down the rocks is beautiful.  If you are doing one thing in the park, this should be it.  Make some time for a few stops to at least walk into the woods a little bit.  It's so peaceful."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Newfound Gap Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Drive the posted speed limit people,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This would be an amazing drive if others would follow the rules of the road. If you are to scared to drive the speed limit, pull off at one of the many locations to do so, so others can go past you that want to do the speed limit. Ever wondered why they have so many pull off locations without a scenic view? That is why. Signs entering the drive specifically state slower drivers pull off so others may pass. The speed limits posted are safe, otherwise they would be made slower. Drive the posted speed limit so you don’t cause traffic jams. If the road scares you then drive an alternate route. This road is far better than the Tail of the Dragon. Give that one a shot if you like twists and turns (318 over 11 miles)."

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Newfound Gap Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Main Drive Through the Park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the one major road which connects one side of the park to the other, and to see almost anything in the park, you have to spend at least a little bit of time on it. We drove it all the way from Gatlinburg (Sugarlands entrance) to the Newfound Gap overlook. At the time we drove, 1 PM on a Thursday, the traffic itself wasn't too heavy, but road work was underway, so we had wait while a flagman directed single-lane traffic. This was true both coming and going for us."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Newfound Gap Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Lovely drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Newfound Gap Road,  aka hwy 441, is a beautiful winding drive. It should take about an hour to drive the approximately 35 miles between Cherokee NC and Gatlinburg TN. They currently are working on a paving project however, which caused almost an hour delay this week for us. However, the temperature was comfortable and we enjoyed the beautiful scenery while we waited. The road through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is narrow and winding so go slowly and pay attention.  If you have a convertible this is what your car is yearning for! Be safe and have fun!"
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Short hike to a nice walk behind falls.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike to the falls with the entire family...2 grandparents, 4 adults, 1 teen and a 7 and 2.5 year old. Everyone walked on their own and made it there and back. We walked behind the falls, touched the falls, put our feet in the water and took many great shots. The 2.5 year old grandson even had us singing the Ants go Marching as we hiked the trail."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Go Early!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our itinerary got moved around so we ended up doing Roaring Fork Nature Drive mid-late morning. When we got to Grotto Falls parking area, it was so full that we decided to come back early the next day. When I say early, I mean you should try to be there around 8am or shortly after. We were there mid week after Labor Day. It was worth going back for. We really enjoyed the hike and the falls. You are able to walk behind the falls without getting wet. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Beautiful falls,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a good hike with a beautiful Falls. The pictures really don't do this Falls any justice it really is beautiful in person. The hike is pretty steep going up but going down it was super easy. It was very crowded trying to find parking that's probably the main negative. Also the drive-up is super steep and a little scary.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,GROTTO FALLS BETTER THEN RAINBOW FALLS,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Get to the park before 9 am if possible, because parking fills up fast. Grotto fasts is a better waterfall than Rainbow falls, shorter and easier hike. Grotto Falls is about an hr hike, somewhat uphill, not bad. You can go behind the falls."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great Hike to a Cool Waterfall ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Arrived later in the day about 2 hours before sunset and not too crowded. I was able to find a parking spot on the road not far from the trailhead parking. 2.6 mile out and back hike that is mildly strenuous as it is a steady but not steep uphill climb to the waterfall. Able to do this in just over an hour. The waterfall is great and make sure you experience walking behind the falls. Much better than the hike to Rainbow Falls which requires twice the effort and time with a waterfall that is not as interesting as Grotto Falls in my opinion. Highlight was seeing the llamas returning from the Lodge at Mt LeConte and even better seeing a bear come out of the woods just after I got into my parked car. 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Amazing Experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Abosoultley Amazing hike. It's a moderate hike and not so hard to do.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Great little hike, good for younger kids",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a nice little hike, parking at the trailhead is difficult. We parked about a quarter mile away and walked up the road to the trailhead. The hike itself was not very strenuous and was relatively short. The falls is very nice, you can walk behind it and reach out and touch it. This is a very busy hike so if you want to avoid the crowd go very early! Overall a nice hike for a family. The drive to and from the trailhead is very nice and a good chance to see some bear and other wildlife."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Moderate hike to a beautiful, secluded waterfall!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"3 mile round trip moderate hike to a secluded waterfall “grotto”. The hike itself is not difficult- it is, however entirely uphill on the way there. Good news is that the way back is all downhill and super easy! The path itself is very well constructed and worn. Super smooth and easy to walk. The parks department did a great job of building infrastructure for walking. The waterfall itself was beautiful and in a bigger, gorgeous setting. Only downside was the amount of people there. Just be patient and try to find a rock to sit on to relax and take in the scenery. Highly recommend!!"
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great hike if you arrive at trailhead at daybreak.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of my favorite hikes in the park with the caveat that you need to arrive at the trailhead at or before daybreak. Why? There are only enough parking spaces for around 15 cars. After that, you must park off the sides of the road - often in a ditch. We saw people walking a long way to get a parking space so getting there early is the trick."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Grotto Falls Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Absolutely a must see.. simply stunning..,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I would definitely suggest walking/hiking this trail. The waterfall is spectacular and you get to walk behind the waterfall.Even though this is paved, please wear proper footwear, flip flops are not appropriate for he steepness and the walk, especially if you want to walk behind the waterfall. Flip Flops get slippery when wet..... Also, I found this hike to be harder on your legs and body due to the paved pathway. I found Laurel Falls trail easier on my legs and body to walk on and endure. Hiking/walking this trail and talking with friends and stopping along the way for photos makes this easier to manage and a lot of fun. Remember to take a trash bag and some water to drink! Parking can be tricky, you can park along the road. Please be sure to use restrooms prior to arriving."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Terrible, unsafe trail to a terrible view.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Anyone who rates this trail positively has never seen mountains before. The views are terrible past the bluffs, and the summit is nothing but a cairn of rocks surrounded by trees so you can’t even see anything from the top, but even if you could, there’s nothing to see because all the landmarks of the valley are covered by trees. Also, very unsafe. At multiple points on the trail, there are hundred foot drops with no guardrails. Several of the bridges are only half built with only one guardrail and nothing on the other side. They can build multiple lodges on top of the mountain but they don’t want to put up guardrails to make sure people don’t fall to their deaths? Sounds like Tennessee. It’s a steep, unsafe, and difficult hike with no payoff. Save yourself the trouble and just go to one of the waterfalls instead."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing trail to the Arch but beware the slippery cave’s slope at the top!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I took our almost 2 year old to the Alum Cave Trail because it seemed like a really popular trail for all ages. Little did we know the difficulty from the Arch to the Cave was rather advanced! Very beautiful and not packed even though there was hardly any parking and we had to park 1/4 of a mile away from entrance. It was worth it and our daughter slept the entire way down the mountain. We had rented an Osprey Carrier from the NOK (at the foothills of the mountain in Gatlinburg). Thank God for that too—super great price $20 or $30 for one day, then $10 every day after that. There were no bugs at all; a lot less than we expected or maybe our bug spray really worked! The pictures are worth more than any review! One thing I highly stress is that if you are traveling with children that are too big to carry and you happen to go all the way to the alum cave, do not let them walk around up there. A 12 year old girl tripped on a rock no where near the edge and fell head first down the cliff and was caught by travelers on the stairs going up to the cave. It was the scariest trauma we have ever witnessed, the mom nearly fell going after her. Several bystanders rushed with medical supplies and fixed her up. The girl walked back down the mountain with her parents limping and bandaged knee. Very very slippery slope of dirt and trip/falling hazards."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing if you go early,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail was so fun. We did the full trail to the top of  Mt Leconte and has so much fun. We got there at about 7 am and the parking lot was filling up already. The trail is easy until the cave. The second half to the summit is very rough and steep, but SO WORTH IT. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Well worth the climb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a strenuous climb which is quite steep in places. The day we hiked up to the cave was raining at times which made the trail a little more slippery.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Challenging but amazing views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My family loved this hike.  We decided to continue on and hike from Alum cave to the top of Mt Le Conte.  It was very challenging in places but the views are top notch.   Some scary sections near the top but my eleven year olds did ok.  Bring lots of water.   Keep in mind the restaurant at the top doesn’t open until noon so if you leave early in the morning it might not be open yet when you reach the top.   You can refill water bottles there for your trip back down.   We loved this hike.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best Hike in the Smokies ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Outstanding hike. The best hike I did in the Smokey Mountains. The first 2.3 miles is a moderate hike and takes you past a cascading river, Arch Rock, inspiration point and Alum Cave Bluff. The next 3 miles is a strenuous hike but so rewarding with incredible views along the way and especially when you reach the summit of Mount LeConte at Clifftops and at Myrtle’s Point. Mount LeConte Lodge at the summit offers rustic overnight accommodations. Best enjoyed on a day with clear skies. Very popular hike so arrive early at or before sunrise if you want to park at the trailhead parking lot if visiting on a busy day. However, there is also parking along the road nearby. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Felt like uphill all the way, but the rewards are worth it",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived at the Alum Cave Trailhead parking lot at 7:00 am on a Sunday. There were 4 parking spaces available in the smaller lot by the restrooms, but there were still plenty of spaces left in the larger parking lot closer to the road and there were many cars parked along the road, presumably overnight hikers who had parked there the previous day.  Since it was a very nice weather forecast (sunny and high in low 70s in Gatlinburg), the trail was crowded. But, we found everyone to be very friendly and very polite – letting faster hikers pass, offering encouragement, and keeping a good social distance as much as possible.  A few hikers wore masks, but most did not or would pull their masks/gaiters up when passing.  We sat down in Alum Cave to enjoy the view and have a snack. After Alum Cave, the number of hikers decreased a bit. We are three women in our early 50s and we are not avid hikers, but are reasonably healthy.  We were each carrying packs around 20-25 lbs each.  The ascent was tough, but very doable – we took it slow and steady with lots of stops for breath, to let other hikers pass, and to take pictures. Including the snack stop, it took us 5 hours to hike the 5 miles to reach LeConte Lodge, where we were spending the night.  We each had one hiking pole, which we highly recommend.  The trail is well maintained with lots of wooden steps, steps carved into rock, and cable handrails.  But, the 2600 feet of elevation gain on the trail makes it feel like almost all the trail is an ascent – the very end, just before the junction with Rainbow Falls Trail near the lodge is the only area that seems to be flat, which is a welcome relief.  There are bridges for the stream crossings. Many areas of the trail were muddy/wet from the rain two days previous and from what we assume are springs. Good hiking shoes/boots are a must, as is a good supply of water.  There are many places with breaks in the trees with inspiring views, along with the glimpses of Alum Cave creek and going through Arch Rock as well as Alum Cave itself.  Even if you are not staying at the Lodge, there are pit toilets and water pumps available at the Lodge to all hikers. There is also a gift and supply store in the office of the Lodge. Beyond the Lodge, there is another 0.7 mile hike out to Myrtle Point for more views and to see the rock cairn which marks the actual peak of Mount LeConte.  And, there is also a 0.3 mile loop to High Tops just beyond the Lodge for more views."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,A rewarding experience,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"After visiting Clingman Dome, Cades Cove and Newfound Gap, I had time to pick one hike in GSMNP. This is the one I picked and I was not disappointed. The hike is of moderate difficulty. It passes by and over a number of beautiful streams and goes through a natural rock arch. The 'cave"" is really the overhang of a cliff, but it is rather unique. The hike is certainly worth the experience. I was there on a Sunday and it pays to get there early for a good parking spot."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Alum Cave Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,A must do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our favorite so far.  My husband and I are in our mid-50’s and very active.  This is rated “strenuous”. We loved the challenge of elevation gain (1,125) and the Arch Rock and Cave Bluffs were very neat. Many stairs to climb throughout and after a long winding stair climb up - all of a sudden you are at the bluffs.  Which was too big to capture in a total photo.  Wear hiking boots and bring several water bottles and snacks.  It is important to get to the trail head early.  (7:30-8am) There are two parking lots and the trailhead is in between. A little hard to see right away. "

",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"First, I need to point out that I LOVE Cades Cove, and have always said that, to me, it is the most beautiful place on Earth. I have visited many, many times throughout my fifty years. I love the scenery, the cabins, the animals, and the solitude of this precious place. I am an extremely patient person (I am a photographer and teacher), and am a deep lover of nature and of the natural world. I have photographs in my home of Cades Cove. We expected to have to take our time going around the loop, and we usually enjoy that experience despite slow traffic. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Cades Cove,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,"If you love grid-lock traffic for 2-4 hours, this place is  for you!",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really should have read the reviews before going. This is a one-way, one lane path that is nothing but stop and go traffic for 2-4 hours. Everyone is looking for the bears and once they are seen, people go crazy and park wherever they can to see them, causing more and more back up. Definitely fill up on gas and pray that your car does not overheat ( we saw some poor souls with a ranger trying to help them) and good luck keeping the kids occupied, there is no cell service and you are mostly looking at grass (at least the mountains are pretty, but there are better views outside this 11 miles of torture). I’m sure the couple of historical cabins are neat, but after 2 hours of stop and go traffic, we took the 2nd of the only 2 short cut routes to leave. Wednesday is a car free day and I can really understand why they do that. So if you love sucking up fumes and playing  car grid lock as you look at mountains, grass, log huts and the occasional bear, this place is for you. Insider Park Ranger Tip: At Sugarland Visitor Center, the Ranger said the best time to go is right before it closes in the evening. He says the traffic starts at 0730 in the morning and will be this way until September!  So go in the evenings or Wednesday when the cars can’t go! Good Luck!"
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Cades Cove,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Not informative,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Perplexed by the popularity of this. History is interesting... but none provided. Not so much as an informational signboard. The structures are labeled, as “Tipton place” etc but zero information on the structure or the Tiptons. Forget Wikipedia as there is no cell service. Do NOT go here without printing or downloading some type of guide or resource in advance. Scenery is pleasant but doesn’t hold a candle to the other views in the park. For wildlife, we saw one turkey. Also a lot of people with their small children hanging out of windows, popping up through sunroofs, and horsing around in backs of pickup trucks. 20 mph and heavy traffic is probably not the best time for this."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Cades Cove,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Beautiful and peaceful,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Cades cove is a beautiful spot nestled in the smokey mountain national park.  It is free to drive thru and there are trails to walk to old houses or to falls and river off shoots. It is a VERY windy road to arrive there, not for the easily motion sick, however the river running along side the road is so beautiful it is easily distracting! There are plenty of little pull offs that can be used to park and go down to the river. We saw people picnic in and fishing, even swimming.  Though I don't know the rules surrounding those things in the park.   Arriving at Cades Cove there is a camp ground and picnic area, no bathrooms for another 6 miles of driving 10 o 20 miles an hour.  It is a meandering drive thru hills and rolling fields of grass, surrounded by towering smokey mountains.  Plenty of places to pull off, walk, hike, picnic etc surrounded by gorgeous scenery.  The drive is SLOW, bad when you need a bathroom...but worth it for the wildlife. We saw strutting turkeys, geese, deer or female elk, and black bears. Definitely a place to visit, would have liked to be more prepared with a picnic, a bathroom break before heading in, and knowledge that some trails were closed due to corona virus. That was a bit frustrating, but understandable. Would highly recommend if you want an out door activity when staying in or near Gatlinburg!"
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Cades Cove,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Simply Wonderful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"These wonderful homesteads, churches and outbuildings will mean so much more if you BRING $1.00 TO PURCHASE GUIDEBOOK at the start of the drive.  Cades Cove is different every visit and worth visiting any time of the year and repeating.  It is true that when tourism is heavy, the drive is annoyingly slow, and I prefer to visit in the off-season for this reason.  During the busy season this might be the only thing you have time for in one day, and you will find yourself in a happier situation if you pack a cooler full of drinks and snacks.  I seem to spend more time here each visit, even when I am not stuck behind a row of cars."

Go to the travel forum page for Great Smoky Mountains and read the post from Reid.  They urge people not to all come in the early morning.  They are also trying to set up a shuttle service from Townsend that they hope to have in place sometime during the summer months. I certainly hope the shuttles have massive bike racks.

This was a beautiful Scenic Drive fun to see how these settlements lived. It started out not so crowded but towards the middle of the day it was a lot of traffic and very slow drive. Saw 2 bears one at the first settlement house... got out the car to take the walk to the house saw a bear walking around in the distance and people taking pictures and got back in the car, not a good choice to walk towards a bear to take pictures. Then saw a bear in the woods on the way out. A lot of people were fascinated by seeing deer but I see that at my backyard at home in the city. It is a pretty lengthy drive at least with all the traffic that we got in. But it was worth it for the beautiful scenery, this would be a once and done trip."

But this time we visited on a Monday morning and were shocked at the traffic and crowds.  There were simply too many people at every stop and there was bumper-to-bumper traffic.  We did not travel the entire loop road because our visit was just not enjoyable.  Perhaps it's time to limit the number of cars in the Cove?

Got here at 11:45 am and I imagine if you come earlier, traffic would not be much of an issue.  We spent 1.5 hours here and we were done by 1:15 pm.  In a lot of the stops, there is not much parking.  And it was pretty crowded.  The Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail is 1 lane and goes 1 direction.  There are waterfalls and overlooks.  We also stopped at Ephraim Bales Cabin.  The cabins at Cades Cove were more interesting and we also found Cades Cove more enjoyable.  "

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Worth the trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our group of all ages & abilities was able to complete this hike (12, 39, 68, 69) because there are plenty of places to stop and rest on the side of the trail (unlike at Laurel Falls). If you take your time, you will be able to make the hike to the top, and the reward is breathtaking views of TN/NC. There are a couple spots that link up with the Appalachian trail if you want to add a little length to your hike. We wore layers on this day, temps were in the low 70s and it wasn’t too cool or windy at the top. Most people wore masks due to Covid-19 right now. We went on a Monday, and it was definitely crowded but not overwhelming. The gift shop was open, but it was window shopping only, meaning you look at the merchandise through the window displays, and check out at a table in front of the gift shop door. Many reviews mentioned the bathrooms being bad and having long lines. You are better off stopping and using the bathrooms before/after at the Newfound Gap overlook that you will pass on your way to Clingman’s Dome. Parking was tricky. You may have to stalk people walking to their cars and catch them as they’re leaving to get a parking place. We parked on the side of the road just past the parking lot because it was so full. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Check the weather and plan before you go,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Second time visiting GSMNP and decided to visit Clingsmans Dome and hike Andrews Bald.  It was clear weather when we headed out. Views were restricted by the time we got to the top of Clingmans Dome because clouds rolled in.  It was still a neat experience though.  Bring a mask and hand sanitizer because it’s crowded up there and no one is really social distancing.  We then hiked Andrews Bald.  Had spotty showers along the way so I would recommend packing ponchos even if it doesn’t seem like it will rain.  Had a nice picnic lunch at the top and then headed back.  The only restrooms are located at the parking lot of Clingsmans Dome and are glorified Porta-potties.  They smell horrible so just be aware before you go.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Top of the World Beauty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clingman's Dome offers breath-taking views of God's handiwork at its best.  Its usually a little cooler at the dome than in the lower elevations, it's often busy and clouds frequently cover the slopes, but when the conditions are right, the far-reaching views and adventures to be had are totally priceless.  The path to the dome is paved, but very steep.  However, burning calves and getting a little winded is a very small price to pay for the reward at the top and once you've been up there, you'll never forget it."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Get here early,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked the Andrew's Bald hike from here.  When we arrived at 7AM there were maybe a dozen cars here with people who had been up to watch the sunrise from the top.  Took us about 2.5-3 hours to hike the trail.  When we got back to the trailhead around 10ish it was significantly more crowded.  Due to the crowds we did not go up to the lookout tower.  There is a small ranger station/gift shop here but as of right now they are only allowing window shopping here.  The only bathroom available up here are pit toilets as well.  We did see a bear cub on our way back down Clingmans Dome road.
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Beauty in the Smokies,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We went to the Dome at the end of September.  Wish the weather up there was a little bit better, you could not see any mountains at the top due to intense fog, so that was disappointing.  I didn't realize how steep the hill up to the dome was prior to going but It is VERY steep but there are a few benches on the way up for breaks.  The gift shop is open but can only shop from the windows and they check you out at the entrance door of the shop.  No cash at the present time only debit/credit cards.  Parking spaces are limited if it is busy so you may have to drive around to find one.  I can at least say we did it once but not for sure if I would climb the hill again."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Be Prepared,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked on Memorial Day with our kids, 5 and 12, and are so glad we did it! The views from the parking area alone are worth the drive to the top. There are tons of pull offs along the way with waterfalls and stunning vistas. That being said, it was very challenging to hike the half mile from the parking lot to the top. Our oldest almost gave up and it took a lot of encouragement from us for her to reach the top. She is now so glad she accomplished it, but be prepared if you do not have athletic children it may be a challenge to get them to the top. Bring water and allow them to take breaks along the way. You will immediately feel the altitude, it feels heavy on your chest and makes it harder to breathe. I watched very athletic-looking people struggling to reach the top and taking frequent rests. I was proud of my out-of-shape, old body for reaching the top, and the views are the payoff. Breathtaking, panoramic mountain views! You even cross the Appalachian Trail along the way, and this makes a great photo opportunity. You will not regret making this hike if you can hang in there to the top. "
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Arrive before 830am peak season for Parking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited mid week Oct 19th 2022. We left the hotel around 7am and arrived at the Dome around 8am.  Parking was about 1/4 full, 21 degrees, snow flurries and wind around 25mph. Was not prepared for such cold temps, about 15 degrees colder than Gattlinburg and much more wind.  By they time we left at 10am, there was no parking available!!!!   Be sure to come prepared for cold weather, ski suits, hats, gloves, etc if temps are cold.  It cleared off before we left and the views are spectacular.  Frankly, the views from the parking lot were good as well.  FYI - restrooms, non flush.  Gift shop opened at 10am, got a really nice referable jacket for $35.  Limited capacity inside, so might be a wait to get in. Worth the trip for sure.  Don't hurry, take your time, but arrive early for parking."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Not so easy but still worth it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clingmans Dome is where Cherry Wonderdog came for a Friday night sunset. The hike up to the top was a lot more grueling than any of us anticipated. The path is completely paved, which allows for parents to push strollers and those in wheelchairs or handicapped scooters to roll instead of walk – at least in theory. We passed one couple halfway, torn between continuing to the lookout tower and turning around out of fear that their scooter battery might fail on route. I’m not sure how much elevation was gained from the parking lot to the actual summit, but it was rather significant, and the steep walk felt to be in excess of a mile. On the way, there were several vista points that provided ample opportunity for selfies and panoramic shots."
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Must visit on Gatlinburg - Oconaluftee trip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Plan it for sunset!! This place was packed. Parking is tricky for sure, but manageable. Very steep hike to reach the tower, if bringing small kids along plan accordingly, pets not allowed on the tower. The views just justifies the visit even if you are not a fan of walking up the steep path to reach the tower( just find a nice spot to sit and relax and watch the sun go down amidst the mountain folds !)"
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Tennessee (TN),Clingmans Dome,Mountains,4.5,Lovely views after a bit of an uphill walk.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The view is lovely from the top, but it will take a bit of a walk to get there. Someone with normal fitness will have no problem, but if out of shape and/or elderly, you might huff and puff some getting up. The path is wide and paved, though, and there are places to sit and rest along the way. Expect crowds. The only drawback is the crowded parking lot; we had to circle several times before a spot opened up. There is a steady stream of cars coming from Gatlinburg and returning by the same route, so taking the road from Cherokee is more relaxing."
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Teton Park Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Great for group photos,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"From Jackson to the Grand Teton National Park Entrance Sign at the south entrance to the park is roughly 24 miles. Ordinarily, this takes less than 45-minutes unless one stops or there is traffic. On approach you drive past views of the Tetons on your left. The sign is a very popular place for group and family photos, so it has it’s own turn off. One parks, if there is a spot, gets out, and waits in line with their group until there is a lull for them. People are friendly, and patient, and will often offer to take a photo for you so you can all be together. This is fee-free stop and does have some parking, just not for extra long vehicles. It is not the fee or park pass entrance. I like these signs, they help organize photos."

We initially started it in the car, but soon felt detached and disconnected from the sights and the outdoors. The walk would have been too long - so bikes seemed like the way to go. It was wonderful to glide along the designated path with the Tetons by your side. It was humbling. Not having to ride on the road with traffic made all of the difference - it makes for a very tranquil and 'connected' experience. Highly recommended."

This road offers a lot more in the way of hiking trails and varied scenery and it is definitely the more scenic way to take in Grand Teton. While it's not a ""drivers"" road in that it's flat and offers few turns, it's definitely a road worth taking an easy drive on since there are so many great views along the way. Also, if you're heading south you can jump off this road and enjoy a shore side drive on the one way Jenny Lake Road. Regardless of how much time you have in Grand Teton, driving this road is an absolute must on your list of things to do!"

If you have multiple days this is a great way to start and get your bearings, and decide where you want to return to.  Take your time and stop at some of the overlooks to get a real view of the park and to see some wildlife. Best turnouts: Willow Flats for wildlife (actually just north of the loop), Oxbow Bend to get down to the river, Snake River Overlook, Cathedral Group and Mount Moran for mountain views, Schwabacher Landing to get down below the main road and feel ""away from it""."

The key to this hike is to do it early in the morning to avoid the crowds and have a better chance of seeing some wildlife. If you decide to do the beaver lake trail back to the parking lot it is more strenuous (moderately).

Some spots are very flat and some have a lot of elevation. Watch out for some tree roots and rocks to sneak up on you, here and there. I would call this a moderate hike.

My wife and adult daughter are in extremely good shape. I, on the other hand, am very much out of shape. That said, I made it from start to finish. Yes, I was huffing and puffing air. Yes, I was sweating profusely in the 20 degree weather but, I made it. The views and scenery were awesome. There were some inconsiderate skiers that wizzed by in excess of 30 MPH without warning but that was the most dangerous part of the trip. I arrived at the parking lot glad to have made the journey!"

It was perfect! We combined it with the Bradley Lake loop to make about a 5 mile event. Views of the Tetons and both lakes were stunning.  We were there in mid-May so there was still snow in some areas and emerging wild flowers in others. Didn't need sticks or foot cleats but definitely had some elevation to conquer.

The hike isn’t too bad.  There is a direct route that goes to the right that is only 1.6 miles and that takes you directly to the lake.  The Taggert Lake trail is to the left and it is 2.4 miles.  Either way the reward when you get there is more than worth it.  Probably one of the most beautiful and serene hiking experiences of my life. "

Get there early.  We got there at 9:30am and snagged the last spot.  Per other's suggestions, we went counter-clockwise on the trail (to the right).  It's supposed to be 4.5 mile hike if you do the full loop.  But our teens wanted to go back the way we came for a total of 3.5 miles.  The path has a lot of scenic stops and great opportunity for photos.  You pass by small waterfall, creeks, beautiful mountain vistas, and even a mule stable.  When you reach the lake, you can find a hidden little area to sit on some boulders and enjoy the peaceful and beautiful view.  We even dipped our feet and cooled off.  It get's hot fast (upper 80's), which feels like 90s in high elevation.  We had a small picnic by the lake and took our time to trek back to the parking lot.  Don't miss this!"

Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Cascade Canyon Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Beautiful Features!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The falls, lookout and canyon were all beautiful and we saw numerous cascades as well as waterfalls on the opposite peaks. We arrived in the parking lot (go as far as you can down the Visitor Center lot) at 6:30am to make the first boat. A bonus that I didn’t know is that the first boat passengers are charged $10 RT vs the usual $18! We took our time going all the way down the canyon until the junction toward other trails so the falls and outlook were very crowded on our way back and we waited for 4 boats before boarding for the return--we counted on both of these congestions so best to be patient (mostly with rude people who were rushing on the rocky trail at the overlook, much to the dismay of others who needed to take it slower). If you can't do the whole trail, go really early or late enough that the crowds have thinned out. Hiking 3 miles or so (RT) with 500 people wouldn't be my idea of a good time. :)"

Then start up to Inspiration Point. It's a climb but does not take long. ( be careful with kid's) Beautiful view !  Then keep going up on trail which is easy hiking and to me the best part of trail. Here you are now in the mountain's.   Go early ,It was not many people going up but passed a lot heading back down .Here are some Photo's."
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Cascade Canyon Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Fantastic hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I took the 3rd ferry of the day and it was great; the lake was still like glass, smooth ride. A beautiful waterfall (Hidden Falls) is almost right off the ferry landing. A brief but moderately strenuous climb takes you up to Inspiration Point with great views of Jenny Lake. The rest of the canyon is pretty level and has beautiful views of the mountains.  I saw a moose cow and a pika along with plenty of butterflies. The canyon seemed overrun with wild flowers. It was beautiful. On the south side of the canyon about 3/4 of the was to the fork there was a beautiful little waterfall that I didn't see a name for. Plus this is about the only way to actually see the Grand Teton. Many people (including myself) mistake the beautiful teewinot for the grand teton, but you can't actually see it from the main road; you need to get on the trails to get a peek."
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Cascade Canyon Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Across the Jenny Lake from the overlook,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Across the Jenny Lake from the overlook are Cascade Canyon, Hidden Falls, and Inspiration Point. Taking the shuttle boat gets one across the lake faster and reduces hiking time. These places are accessible from the Cascade Canyon Trail; part of the Jenny Lake Trail Loop, which goes around the lake and into Cascade Canyon. From there one can go further north to Solitude Lake, or south to the South Fork of Cascade Canyon, and beyond that, to Hurricane Pass, and Schoolroom Glacier. These hikes are rated strenuous."

Hiked down around 11, increasing numbers of people, trail from Inspiration Point to boat dock was tourist hell.  45 minute wait for a boat in hot sun with many line-cutters.  Still worth it."
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Cascade Canyon Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Must Do Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a must do hike.  I am from Iowa and not a seasoned hiker, so take that into account when I rate the difficultness of the hike.  We took the ferry over and back to save us 5 miles of hiking.  The beginning of the hike, the hike to Hidden Falls, was a moderate uphill hike.  Not too bad.  The hike to Inspiration Point was a more difficult uphill hike.  It is doable with several water breaks.  We took our time.  Note, there are some places that may cause those with a fear of heights some trouble.  My wife was able to do it and she is not good with heights.  Beyond Inspiration Point is the Cascade Canyon Trail.  At this point begins some easy uphill sections but mostly flat sections back into the canyon.  Most people stop at Inspiration Point and that is the hardest part of this hike.  I strongly suggest another mile or 2 into Cascade Canyon to see some breathtaking views.  Remember, it is all down hill on the way back."

Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Craig Thomas Discovery & Visitor Center in Moose,Visitor Centers,4.5,Welcome to Grand Teton,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Craig Thomas Discovery & Visitor Center is a must stop for first-time visitors to Grand Teton National Park.

There is nearly 4,800 square feet of interactive exhibits that focus on four main themes central to the park--place, people, preservation and mountaineering. Highlights include life-size wildlife sculptures, mountaineering and western memorabilia, a three-dimensional park map, floor-to-ceiling windows, an impressive rock fireplace, an outstanding art gallery and a 154-seat auditorium with stunning views of the Teton Range. Stroll through the building, which was opened in 2007, and learn about the unique features that make Grand Teton a world-renowned national park. In addition, visitors can wander through the 900-square-foot gallery room with displays of fine art from the park's permanent collection and other traveling exhibits. In the 1,500-square-foot book store, you'll find a wide variety of books, maps, souvenirs and educational materials. Another interesting feature is a large relief model of the park that uses technology to demonstrate glacier movement and animal migration. And there's a photomural tribute to Teton mountaineers that utilizes the center's 30-foot walls.

The only drawback was all the loud children and parents who let them run wild. They keep the moose away. Try to go right before dawn when less people are there.

I wish I would have read the reviews a little bit better, because this is definitely not a hike or a true trail. The trail is overgrown, and doesn’t really lead to anywhere. There are a TON of bugs. It’s more of a place to enjoy the view or spot some wild life.  It’s a great place for photos, and you can easily walk with your equipment to a nice little photo pot area. There is bathroom facility’s, so that’s a plus. "

Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Jenny Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great hike to see Hidden Falls at Jenny Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We are a 60ish husband and wife.  One of us is a mild jogger and the other not so much.  We took the ferry across the lake and hiked up to Hidden Falls.  The falls and scenery were gorgeous.  The climb to the falls is a moderate uphill effort.  We felt good but knew the additional climb to Inspiration Point would be too much for us.  We did decide to hike the rest of the way around the lake back to the East boat dock/parking lot which is about 2.4 miles of moderate hiking.  There were a lot of rocks and roots and mud on the path and you have to watch your footing.  It also goes up and down and you need to make way for other people so it does take some effort.  I saw people with little kids and didn't know how they did it.  I would recommend this hike as it is a few hours with gorgeous views but do know that it is not for out-of-shape people.  If you are, then take the ferry both ways!"
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Jenny Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Early morning recommended!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived at parking lot around 7:30 on Thursday, lot was already 75% full. Started hike at trailhead going counter clockwise.  This direction allowed for incredible views of the mountains in spotlight of the sunrise, blue skies begins them and the beautiful lake in front.  You know, the views you see by professional photographers.  So many photo ops along this hike as the mountain peak’s angles change as you follow the trail around.  We went up to inspirational point and continued on to the cascade canyon trail.  We hiked this to the fork and back down where we continued to hidden falls and then back to Jenny Lake to finish the rest of the trail to parking lot.  This whole trip was 16 miles but well worth it for out family of six, 44,43,19,18,14,10 years of age.  We hiked in tennis shoes, Chaco, Teva and keen sandals. Took about 7.5 hours but we stopped for snack/picnic/water breaks.  Saw 2 bull moose along cascade canyon trail!  Absolutely beautiful!!!"

Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Jenny Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Wonderful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Depending on how you do it, this trail can be quite crowded if you sleep late and only take the boat across. Avoid South Jenny Lake area except to walk through. It’s nice but far too well known. Park at the String Lake Trailhead before 9:00 a.m. and enjoy your day. It’s ten km all around the lake but adding a spur up cascade canyon 1 or 2 km will add to your pleasure greatly. Another way to enjoy it is to come I’m October or May. Around each bend of the trail is a new delight."
Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Jenny Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Amazing trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiking in Jenny Lake was on the the best hikes we've been on!  We took the ferry ride to and from the trailhead and we're very glad we did.  They said it would have added 2.8 miles each way to hike if we didn't take the ferry.  The ferry ride was $50 round trip for a family rate.  Once there, we hiked 0.6 miles to Hidden Falls - it was beautiful!  Then we did the 0.4 steep and rocky hike up to Inspiration Point and it was worth it.  We then kept going to Cascade Canyon which was beautiful - lots of changing landscape that opened up in a beautiful canyon with views of the snow topped Tetons.  We spent about 2.5 hours on this trail before heading back.  We started at 8:30 am and headed back a bit before noon.  We were told that it gets extremely busy later in the day which we saw when after we got off the boat.  Cars were parked a long way away and there was a long wait for the boat ride to and from.  Definitely get there early if you can, and I'd suggest bug spray as it was quite buggy in the morning."

We turned around after 1 mile in, we made it to beautiful open views of the Tetons.  Our kids were ages 7,10 and 11 and they did great . The toughest part is up to inspiration point. It was 4 miles round trip, we took the boat both ways . They have a family deal for 2 or more kids and 2 adults for $50 for the boat ride there and back, which we enjoyed because then we spent longer In the canyon. "

The hike to Hidden Falls is moderate. Then next 0.5 mile up to Inspiration Point is more technical and strenuous but worth it for the spectacular views.

Grand Teton National Park,Wyoming (WY),Grand Teton,Mountains,5.0,Amazing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely beautiful!   The Teton peaks are amazing and the meadows are gorgeous.   The golden leaves of the Aspen trees, in all their yellow glory, against the powerful gray of the mountains is something I won't soon forget.   We were lucky enough to see a bison, a moose and her baby, and many pronghorn sheep during our drive.   Jenny Lake is absolutely serene and crystal clear!  It truly is uplifting and joyful to take some time in the Grand Tetons park.   Please note, however, that signage is a bit misleading in the park.   Along the main road, before turning into GTNP, a sign says that Yellowstone is 55 miles away.   Yes, it is... to the very border of Yellowstone.   Old Faithful Geyser is another 1.5 or 2 hours away into Yellowstone.   Also, within GTNP intself, many of the stopping points ( restaurants, gas stations, gift shops, etc.) are closed at this point in the year.   The only indication of this is right at the entrance to the Park where you pay to go in.   If you miss the posting, you will not know that the service area you're aiming for is closed.     One last mention  is that Jenny Lake is certainly worth stopping at.   Smaller than Jackson Lake, it is nonetheless gorgeous.   There is a sign saying that a good hike near the lake is 2.8 miles.   Not being hikers, or even having water or such for a hike, we decided to do it.   But we could not figure out what the 2.8 mile length brought you to.   There are no further signs.   It is clear to the eye that the lake is definitely a long hike to go all around, probably more like 10 miles at least.   There was mention of a waterfall at some point, but again no signage to tell you where.   We asked people coming the other way what their experience was.   Many had hiked for a greater part of the day and since it was 3:30 p.m. or so, they did not advise going onward.   (Plus, they probably summed us up as ""newbies"" too.)   Hate to say anything at all negative about GTNP because  the visit was something I will never forget... beautiful, wild, stunning.   Just a few more signs or notices or such would make it a more time managed and safer experience."

From the parking lot and all hikes in the area you are blown away by the view of Grand Teton and Mount Moran.  We took a hike around the visitor center and along the lake and even on a cloudy day it was beautiful.  That being said, for our money, the 2 mountains are about the only spectacular sights in this park.  We did the entire loop road and once you get far enough east, it is pretty unspectacular.

The key to this park is GO EARLY! By mid morning it gets crowded. We always went early to our hikes and had no problems with parking. One hike by Jenny Lake, we were finished by about 11:00 a.m. and the parking lots were full and people were parking on the entrance drive and on the highway."

The first day was mostly sitting drives on Teton Park Road past the lakes.  While at Jenny Lake we got word that Bear # 399 was running around the snake river with her four cubs. This itself is a miracle for a grizzly to have four cubs. The next day was spent climbing into Delta lake. We made the mistake of not seeing the Helen that was placed on the trail head leading into the lake and ended up going all the way up to disappointment peak. This was an additional two extra hours of climbing but well worth the view."

The most traffic we saw was at Jenny Lake and it was very, very crowded with lots of people parked on the side of the road. I planned this trip in my head for 10 years and I was not disappointed.

It's situated so that you can see either sunrise or sunset. The way the light hits the canyon walls is quite beautiful. Hopi seemed to be the most popular of the spots at sunset when we were there. If you take the red shuttle in the canyon, it is easy to walk to the stop just before Hopi for a smaller crowd."

Each one is unique and doesn’t get old stopping at new ones. Hopi Point was the end of my hike along the Rim Trail from The Abyss. The shuttle stops in both directions here making it a great stopping point. While not providing quite as much of a panoramic view as other spots, it’s a gorgeous view! While waiting for the shuttle, I about had the whole place to myself making it a good place to get some quiet and solitude."

While there are multiple look out points for viewing the majestic Grand Canyon, Hopi Point probably offers the best views. "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Hopi Point,Lookouts,5.0,Did a Helicopter Ride,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This rim is on Indian land and their ticket system is very different and I am not sure worth the cost.  The glass skywalk is not all that I felt it hyped up to be and ofcourse you are going to buy one of the pictures taken.  We did do a helicopter ride down to the bottom of the canyon and enjoyed it  and the cost was reasonable.  
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Hopi Point,Lookouts,5.0,Popular spot for sunset!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the stops along the Hermit's Rest Trail and is also one of the most popular spots to see the sunset. Everybody knows that so expect a crowd there. But you don't need to congregate with the crowd right at the shuttle stop. Just walk 50 yards further along the rim. You'll still see essentially what they're seeing. When you get ready to head back to the village area, don't go back to the stop they dropped you at. You need to walk a couple of minutes east to get to the loop for the bus that'll take you directly back. Also, don't think this is the only place to see the sunset. There are lots of other places which can also be enjoyable."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grandview Point,Lookouts,5.0,Interesting Viewpoint,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I decided to stop at this point on my way to Desert View Watchtower. This point was accompanied by some history of early tourists and a copper mine. I read the bulletin board and was impressed with the history. There is also a trail that starts off from this point. I walked a bit down to get better views which was a great way to get more views. Honestly, there are no bad views along the South Rim points. Just take your time absorbing the views and enjoy the points you can stop at because there is no wrong point."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grandview Point,Lookouts,5.0,Outstanding. No. 1 thing to see before you die!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We arrived late afternoon and saw the canyon as the light was fading. We had booked the 1/2 hour helicopter flight early next morning which was unfortunately was cancelled due to cloud cover in the canyon. We went back and saw the canyon as the cloud came and went which was spectacular and eerie. I’d say visiting the Grand Canyon is the No 1 thing to do before you die.

You will learn a lot of history about the old mines that exist down below in the canyon. You can also hike down into the canyon here. If you are prepared for an overnighter, you can hike all the way down to the bottom of the canyon, camp at the bottom, and then explore the old mines, and hike back up the next day. A great experience for those without kids or pets!"

Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Mather Point,Lookouts,4.5,Great place to view the sunrise!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We found this to be a great place to view the sunrise as there is plenty of parking at the Visitor Center and then just a short walk to Mather Point. It is easy to find in the dark and plenty of room for everyone to have their own little space to enjoy. If you come to the Grand Canyon, a sunrise at Mather Point should be in the itinerary!"

It is only a short walk from the South Rim Visitor’s Center. The view is absolutely jaw dropping! Pictures of the Grand Canyon simply cannot do it justice! I was fortunate to arrive on a cold day with light crowds. Also, the cliffs were covered in a light snow which added to the beauty of the scene before me. This is by far the most accessible location to see the Canyon."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Mather Point,Lookouts,4.5,First View,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Mather Point gave me the first view of the Grand Canyon. I was awestruck with the views. Although it had great views, since this point is the easiest and closest access it is also the most populated point. Upon my visit this was the point with more people since it seems to be everyone's first stop. "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Mather Point,Lookouts,4.5,Spectacular and Popular Observation Point,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Spectacular views of the Canyon. If you only have time to visit one or two observation points, Mather and Yavapai Points are probably the best and most convenient. However, they are also probably the most visited spots as they are near the Visitor Center unless you visit during the off season or during a pandemic and it is 34 F like it was when we were there in late October. There is a cool ledge that extends out into the canyon with no safety barriers just west of Mather Point. Try to see other vistas like Mohave and Hopi Point along the road to Hermit's Rest or Moran or Lipan Points along the East Rim Drive."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Mather Point,Lookouts,4.5,Beautiful but busy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Really nice built up viewpoint area along the south rim.

Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Mather Point,Lookouts,4.5,Sunrise spot,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although all GCNP viewpoints are remarkable, we were told this is the spot to watch the sun rise.  We arrived early and watched the sun come over the horizon, but the experience, although pleasant, was not nearly as enjoyable as sunset at Hopi Point.  Mather point is a good distance from GC lodging but the shuttle system runs early before sunrise and has stops within walking distance of the point, the Visitor Center and the Canyon gift shop."

Don't hesitate to drive around as spots open up constantly.  This is the Visitors Center Parking Lots.  Here you will find the Visitor Center, large bathrooms, and the paved trail that leads to Mather Point.  Tons of viewpoints and spaces to look. The trail follows along the rim with railings to offer much needed space for crowds.  At the end is the actual viewpoint with amazing views.  Crowded, but be patient as the view is worth it!"
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon Desert View Watchtower,Observation Decks & Towers,4.5,Great views and shop - be aware of COVID limitations right now,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This area is either your first stop on the way in to the park if you use the East gates, or it is your last view on your way out if you are driving down Desert View Drive.  BE AWARE - right now the East gates are closed because of COVID restrictions and much of this area is restricted.  When it is open, there is a great watchtower with amazing views of the canyon, whether it is your first or last view for your visit.  If you are staying in the Village, it is well worth the trip out here because of the history of the watchtower and the views.  Parking is decent and there is some walking needed, in case that is a concern.  There is also food available (usually) but I don’t believe any is available during the COVID restrictions.  The Desert View Drive is also worth it as you get a number of pull over vantage points with usually fewer people around than at the visitor’s center or the Village."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon Desert View Watchtower,Observation Decks & Towers,4.5,A high point of my trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Desert View Watchtower exceeded my expectations for it. Having walked and driven a lot of the South Rim, I expected more amazing panoramas, but the view from Desert View north (upstream) and west (downstream) were probably the most beautiful of any point on the Rim. It’s certainly the best view of the Colorado River you can get. But beyond that even was the impressive beauty of the Watchtower itself, especially the artwork covering the walls and ceiling. It felt less like being in a gallery looking at artworks than of being inside an immense work of art. "

I highly recommend entering in the morning on this side as it is far less busy than the west side.  We had no wait, while on the other side when we exited they were backed up a good mile waiting to get in.  Lots of parking options here.  No issue finding a spot.  It is a short, paved walk down to the tower, bathrooms, food options, and gift shop area.  Bathrooms were in good order.  The outlook was nice.  You are not allowed to go up in the tower, which was a bummer."

Stop here for breathtaking views of not only the Canyon, bthe Painted Desert as well. Focal point of this vast overlook is the Mary Colter Watchtower filled with designs taken from her experiences researching the surrounding Native American cultures. Visitation is once again allowed in the building, albeit in reduced and monitored numbers. Best buy the descriptive book available from the sponsoring Conservancy to better understand your visit. The surrounding site also houses a grocery, two snack bars, a gift shop, and campground. And picnic tables right near the Canyon rim"

That whole road from that entrance is gorgeous with many lovely (and not busy) pull outs. Desert View is the first place you'll get to. There is a campground and a gas station with pumps over 24/7, which is good because the only other places to get gas around here are Cameron or Tusayan. Nothing else in the park."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon Desert View Watchtower,Observation Decks & Towers,4.5,Climb the Tower!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Watchtower is open for visitors now. Twenty timed tickets ate given out every 15 minutes for 15 minutes forward so tickets given out at 2:46 are for 3:00. The tickets allow you to climb up to the 2nd, 3rd, and top floors. The interior and view on these floors are amazing! This is what made our visit special. There is a lot of construction going on around the tower which is distracting. And the bathrooms are closed with only ports-potties available. The first time we stopped here for sunset, the porta-potties were full and dirty. We stopped three days later at midday and the porta-potties were decently clean."

Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon Desert View Watchtower,Observation Decks & Towers,4.5,Hint: Enter Early and Enter from the East Entrance to Avoid Crowds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to do the south rim of the Grand Canyon after an early departure from Page, AZ. The drive along Highway 64 was easy and less traveled in the early morning. Entering the park from the east allowed us to avoid the big crowds and longlines at the west Main entrance. The route is very drivable though you can park and access some trailheads. The pullouts for viewing and photos are designed well and provide spectacular views. The Desert View Watchtower is the first main viewing area from the east. The added bonus is the watchtower which while closed for climbing still provided clean views of the canyon. It also has a giftshop.  Each stop often provided new views of the vast variety of rock formations in the canyon. Trees and vegetation also add interesting backgrounds. The further west we went on 64, the more crowded it became -- so start early and go in from the east entrance to enjoy the sites without huge crowds."

So we took the Desert View Drive and we were so glad we did.  No crowds and you can stop along the way and see spectacular views.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from the south rim inside the park.  It's crowded.  Most restaurants are closed due to COVID-19.  And the Visitor Center is closed.

Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon National Park,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Must do!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Took a day trip by plane from Vegas one day, well worth it! We were brought to the west end of the canyon to spend a few hours roaming by ourselves. Was this something to see...its hard to truly wrap your head around it, especially since it might hit you how big the canyon really is! I've never been afraid of heights and im still not, however being able to walk right up to the edge of the canyon with nothing to stop me from falling was extremely cool and freaky at the same time. In some parts of the canyon there are railings up so if you want to you can stand there to feel more comfortable, be cautious either way because things happen. When we went it was windy so because i wanted to look straight down i decided to lay on my stomach and pull/crawl up to the edge and look over with someone hanging onto me...just incase. Again, none of this normally makes me nervous, i love heights and adrenaline but in reality, you need to be careful and have common sense while walking around. The Grand Canyon is something i would recommend to everyone, and see it from many different points/areas/cities...they all have something different to offer. I plan to check out the other end next year!"

You seriously do not get much better than this for a natural attraction. The park is absolutely pristine, clean with no trash anywhere. Please remember to take plenty of water and it helps to be in good physical condition as distances can be further than they appear. Even if you drive to each parking lot you will still get a decent amount of walking in. In the summer it can get brutal hot as very little shade exists on trails around the rim.

Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon National Park,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Great Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What is there to say? It is incredible. Crowds are heavy so here are a few tips that worked for us. We arrived just at sunset so we went to Mather Point which was very crowded. We went back to Mather Point for sunrise the next morning and much lighter crowds with a great view of the sunrise. We then took the shuttle to Bright Angel Lodge and got a grab and go breakfast at the Cafe/fountain (limited choices- b'fast burrito, packaged muffin, or danish), but it is the only place open before 8am. Then took Hermit Road shuttle and got ahead of the crowds. Walked some of the rim trail between stops and saw only a few people. By the time we got back to the start, the  shuttles were full and long lines. Then we drove Desert View Drive at our own pace. No trouble parking at each overlook,  lots of other people at each stop but not super crowded like at Mather Point."

Arrived at 3:00pm - two hours prior to sunset. Just wanted a glimpse and return back 4.5 hours to Las Vegas. Unfortunately, the park entrance gate was backed up for miles. We sat in line for two hours while the sun set on our dreams of seeing the Grand Canyon. Once we got to the rim it was dark. Couldn’t see 100 feet in any direction. Shame on the National Park Service for blocking our goal so they could charge $38 per car. Let the traffic in and charge on the way out of the park. Or let people pay online and bypass the line. My kids were devastated. Horrible horrible experience.."

Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon North Rim,Canyons,5.0,Beautiful & Far Less Crowded than the South Rim,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I was in Kanab for a week at the end of November 2020. Due to COVID-19, tourism was at an all time low. I decided to take advantage of the thin crowds and visit the North Rim as it was still open (they normally close by October 15). The drive from Kanab was around 80 miles one way and the North Rim was day use only. Let me just say it - it was gorgeous! Apart from the fact that there were no crowds on the scenic drive (yes, there is a scenic drive on a very windy road), my 5 mile round trip hike to Cape Final for sunset only had me at that point. It was amazing to have that whole place to myself. If you get a chance to come to the North Rim (or are staying at Kanab or Page and the North Rim is open), do come here - fewer crowds, gorgeous scenery, beautiful sunsets make this a 5 star destination. Highly recommended!"

I have been to the West, East, and South Rim and no matter how you view the canyon it is amazing. The North Rim is definitely not as popular but that was not a problem. During our visit the Cottonwoods were changing colors and it made for a beautiful site at certain elevations. We did all the look outs and i would highly recommend this if you are short on time and want to see from above. Bright Angel, Angel's Window, and Roosevelt Point are a must.

If you start at the village and head towards Hermits Rest you can hop on and off the bus when you get tired.  Great views all along the way.  Be sure to stop at Hermit's Rest at the end of the road for a look at this historic Mary Coulter building.  There are restrooms, a gift shop and a snack shop here as well.  There are pit toilets at Hopi Point alomg the way which is also a great spot to watch the sunset.  You can also walk the rim trail to the East from the village for more great views."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Can walk as much or as little as you would like,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What's great about the Rim Trail is you can pop on it just for a viewpoint or walk the entire length of it if you really want to. It is mostly level with a bit of up and down. There are amazing views of the canyon wherever you go. The areas near the visitor center and the villages are busier, but you can also get away from the crowds."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Beware of ice in the winter,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We walked from the Visitor Center to the El Tovar Hotel and it was a memorable experience.  the views are incredible but since it was January, the trail was cold and covered in ice.  It made the walk treacherous so my wife and I were forced to leave the trail and walk through the woods in several spots.  The trail could also use a few more signs showing the distance to landmarks."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Get out of the village,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Rim Trail is an easy way to enjoy amazing views of the Grand Canyon. The most crowded portions are in Grand Canyon Village and near Mather Point and Yavapai Point. For the best experience, get away from the crowds by walking part of the Rim Trail between Hermits Rest and Grand Canyon Village. We took the red shuttle to Maricopa Point at around 8:30 am and walked to Hermits Rest, about 7.6 miles in total, but you can walk as little or as much as you like. Very easy with great views, and not a lot of people until we got to Hermits Rest around noon. The best part of the trail was from Powell Point to Monument Creek Vista, which is a dirt path (not paved) that gets you close to the edge of the canyon, although not too close! The part of the trail between Monument Creek Vista and Pima Point is a paved walk through pygmy forest rather than along the Grand Canyon Rim, plus it’s shared with bikes, so I would recommend skipping that portion. There are restrooms at Hopi Point and Hermits Rest."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,The Rim Trail is a great way to see Grand Canyon views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Red Line on the Shuttle service will take you to each of the 10 stops along the Rim Trail so the you can see the Grand Canyon at you own pace.  Starting at Pipe Creek Vista and ending at Hermit's Rest lookout point, take the bus or walk between, Mather Point, Powell Point, Maricopa Point. Hopi Point and Pima Point.  It is stunning."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Totally wow!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great way to see this American treasure. Great series of hikes with free shuttle service makes this an unbelievable way to see the park. Winter bus service is somewhat limited but still a great way to get out and about.
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Great Way To See The Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a long trail at approximately 13 miles from South Kaibab Trailhead to Hermits Rest. A large portion of it is paved, but the stretch between Hopi Point and Monument Creek Vista is not paved, narrow, and very close to the edge without guard rails. During inclement weather and after a snow fall, hikes are not recommended on this part of the trail. The Hermits Rest Free Shuttle Bus (Red Line) is recommended for this part of the trail, and one can board the bus at the Bright Angel Trailhead. Check the park's website for bus schedules. Enjoy the wonderful view along this trail. We certainly did. "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Great Way to Experience the Vastness of the Grand Canyon,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked from the Geology Museum to Hermit’s Rest as two parents with 14, 12, and 9 year olds kids.  It was an intense 12 miles (we took the shuttle back) with unrelenting incredible and overwhelming views of the Grand Canyon.  The Canyon is so massive that the various viewpoints, while all individually amazing, don’t really differ that much in their experience, so this may not be a really “necessary” hike.  In other words, taking the shuttle through some or all of it, or skipping a viewpoint or two, won’t really detract meaningfully from the experience.  The one downside is that the trail is well maintained for most of the beginning and for the last couple miles to Hermit’s Rest, but is a poorly maintained dirt trail for a couple miles in the middle."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Spectacular: go the downhill direction,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Spectacular! We did a short hike of a little less than 3 miles, from the Bright Angel Lodge area, to the main Visitor Center. Spectacular views every step of the way!! But I hope this will help someone: do the hike in the reverse of what we did! The direction we went was almost entirely uphill, usually not very steep but uphill nonetheless. Maybe about 200-300 feet elevation gain. Do yourself a favor and do the hike in the downhill direction, from Visitor Center to Bright Angel. You can always take the shuttle back to the Visitor Center. In the downhill direction, it would be a very easy walk on smooth paved trails, with incomparable views. "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rim Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Can't Beat This Place,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Back here once again. In January and February you can drive the Hermit Road. After that the bus shuttle kicks in and the road closes to most private vehicles. So I waited for a couple of clear, warmer days and made the trip over. Parked at Hopi Point and walked the half mile or so back to the  Powell Memorial where I left off last time. Then back to Hopi and on to Mohave. Views were outstanding. Some snow on ground but nothing serious enough to handicap the walk. Because I had the use of my own vehicle, I returned to it and drove on to the Abyss, Monument Vista, and Pima Point, winding up at the Hermit Rest for a bit of a rest and snack. On my next visit here I'll try to cover the space between Mohave and Hermit on foot. Since you're reading this, you should do something like this, too!"

We were passed by so many people that looked like they were in a rush.  WHY?  On the way back up, we were passed by people grumbling at each other because they were exhausted, but for some reason, never took a break.  I hate to tell you this, but there is no trophy waiting for you at the top."

Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),South Kaibab Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Steep but worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You will get amazing views in 0.9 miles when you reach Ooh Aah point. At that point, you will be getting about 80% of the views, for 20% of the work. You can continue on to Cedar Ridge at 1.5 miles, or Skeleton Point at 3.0 miles, but you will pay for it on the hike back up to the rim. Restroom at Cedar Ridge, no water."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),South Kaibab Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Go down to Skeleton Point to be right in the middle of the canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Make sure you have good hiking shoes with traction devices and poles, especially in winter. When going up, take your time, breathe and admire the scenery. It is around 3 hour hike going back up but it is definitely worth it."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),South Kaibab Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing Views Down to Ooh Aah Point,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took a short hike down to Ooh Aah Point.  Our hike was only a small fraction of the trail (about 0.9 mile one way), but with amazing views around every corner, we were still able to appreciate the grandeur of the canyon as we made out brief descent.  "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),South Kaibab Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Awesome Views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I started this hike with the intention of only getting to Ooh Aah Point and then returning back. Since I traveled in September 2019, the Park Rangers suggested for hiking not to take place between the hours of 10AM - 4PM due to hot weather. "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),South Kaibab Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,One of our favorite hikes!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the 6:00am hikers shuttle from Bright Angel Lodge to South Kaibab trailhead.    The bus was so full after the second stop that they didn’t even have any room for hikers at the third stop.  We saw an elk when we got off the shuttle.  Many people on this shuttle appeared to have plans beyond Skeleton Point (maybe Phantom Ranch or the other rim).  It was very crowded at the beginning of the hike. My husband and I were trying to take a relaxing, slower pace and we were getting passed by runners and people who seemed to be trying to make it to Ooo Ahh Point for sunrise.  Our plan was to hike to Skeleton Point and back for the 6 mile round trip.  We stopped for lots of pictures and a bathroom break at Cedar Ridge.  It took us about an hour and 50 minutes to make the 3 miles down.  At Skeleton Point we went to the left and were able to see the Colorado River and admire the views.  After Cedar Ridge the crowds really cleared out and we had that 1.5 miles almost to ourselves.  People were either way beyond us or turning around at Cedar Ridge.  The hike back up was tough, but it was not as bad as we were expecting.  Maybe we over prepared, but we had plenty of water, snacks and took very frequent breaks to catch our breath.  It only took us 2:45 to get back up with quite a lot of breaks.  All told we got in the trail at 6:30 and were back up by 11:30.  One of our favorite hikes we’ve done!  Some tips- bring lots of water, snacks, hiking poles, plan for an early start so you are back before noon if at all possible, and know your limitations before you head out."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),South Kaibab Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Not to be missed,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We waited until about 5:30 pm to do the 0.9 mile hike down to Ooh Aah Point. The temperature was perfect at this time even in August, following a thunderstorm. They hike down seemed further than a mile and I started to worry that the lookout point was unmarked- don’t worry, you can’t miss it! Breathtaking vista over the canyon in evening light was amazing. We took turns taking family photos with another group that was there at the same time and got some amazing shots. The hike back up was a bit strenuous with a lot of stairs- make sure to bring water and take it easy."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),South Kaibab Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Strenuous hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the shuttle bus from the visitor center (which just started running again the day we made the hike) to the trail head entrance.  Plenty of people were parked on the side of the road for the hike, but they had to walk another 1/2 mile or so to get to trail.  We hiked to skeleton point, which is 6 miles round trip.  What an awesome strenuous hike in 110 degree temps.  Super fun with great views.  We actually hiked for about 2 minutes past skeleton to get a glimpse of the Colorado River.  I would suggest walking those extra couple minutes.  We only brought 2 bottles of water, a beer,  and an pack of ice (which we turned into another bottle when it melted).  This was NOT nearly enough with the heat this particular day!  Do NOT make the same mistake we did, and bring plenty of water; there are no filling stations on this hike!!  We had to ration the last part of the hike, which was not fun. There are bathroom facilities at Cedar Ridge which is at about the 2 mike mark.  Took us about 4.5 hours and we stopped for lunch and a beer, and a ton of pics along the way.  Great hike!!"
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),South Kaibab Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Love this trail to Skeleton Point - 6 Miles round trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"WOW! Our goal was to make it to “Skeleton Point” and we made it! It is 3 miles down with a round trip of 6 miles. We stopped at Ooh Aah Point, Cedar Ridge point (bathrooms) and then Skeleton Point. At Skeleton Point you will go to the left of the sign and you will see the Colorado River! We took our time and took lots of pics, it took us about 5-6 hours. We took a snack / lunch break at the final point and spent time resting up before our ascent. What they say is true, it will take longer getting up then going down. "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,A Different View from Below,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful, well-kept trail that allows a special vantage point of the canyon and rim.  We headed down, not sure how far we'd go knowing that every 100 easy feet forward represented anther 100 tough feet back.  I took advantage of those we passed by asking them at what point did they turn around.  Just as they're huffing and puffing, sweating bullets and looking like they can keel over at any moment, that's when I  would pepper them with questions.  Amusing, and I also found you get closer to the truth that way. "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,The pain was worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail was the highlight of our trip.  We hiked down to  Plateau Point and back in less than 8 hours.  We could have done it much quicker had I prepared myself for the hike.  You might be able to go to the 1.5 or 3.0 mile mark and back with little to no training or preparation, but I wouldn’t recommend going past that point if you are not in shape.  If you can’t hike 12 miles on flat ground you won’t be able to do it here either."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Nice hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike the same day we did Kaibob.  We only went to the mile and a half mark as we were totally spent from our earlier hike.  Very hot day inside the Canyon as we were told temps were around the 110 degree mark.  There are water stations along the way, so that's helpful.  Kaibob Trail for us was a bit more scenic, so we preferred it over Angel.  Hiking down is easy, just don't forget.....you have to hike back up.....which is the hard part.  Next time we plan to get down to Indian Garden (4.5 miles), tho several hikers we ran into that got that spot, said the payoff wasn't really worth it. Fun hike!"
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Just do it.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We're older so we knew we were not going all the way down.  But we took our time, saw a petroglyph that another hiker pointed out only about 100 - 200 ft from the start under the rim, and hiked down to the archway in the trail.  About 40 minutes total and returned."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Very worth experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Don't let them scare you.  If you're in shape, you can get back up from 1.5 mile marker about as fast as you go down.  After getting back up, we wished we had gone down further.  Extremely scenic.  We got to see some Bighorn sheep so keep your eyes open.  Most easily seen by spotting their white butts.  Early October was perfect time to be at the Canyon."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,To 1.5 Mile Resthouse,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked to 1.5 mile rest for both sunset and sunrise back to back and it was amazing. Going down is easy but coming back up will put some lactic acid in your quads. Highly recommend taking this semi easy (considering the trip from the rim to the river and back is 14 hours long) hike!
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Hike into the Canyon...even just a little,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the trail where people head out for the four days of serious hiking and camping into the canyon, and even rock climbing.  But I just found that if you want to go in a 1/4 mile or a mile, it's OK and well worth it.  After several trips to the Grand Canyon over the years I didn't realize that.  Even the first 1/3 of a mile is spectacular and you can do it safely in casual clothes and good shoes (although I did pass a group of ladies in Jack Rogers sandals...Yow. )"
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Good trail choice,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Definitely do this trail over South Kaibab, particularly if you don't have experience hiking much. This trail did not seem as slippery, and it is also easier. There are also rest stations and water stops (not all are available all year), which South Kaibab did not have. There is also a really nice portion of the trail that is relatively flat about 3.5 miles down and a wooded section. "
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Be Prepared,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Do NOT underestimate the hike up. As a sign states very accurately 'going down is optional, going up is mandatory' That being said, if you want to completely immerse yourself in the grand canyon, this is the hike to do. You don't truly understand the depth until you start going into the belly and realize just how long it took to go so little. START EARLY, bring water and proper hiking gear, and unless you are physically fit, do not try going down to the colorado river and back in one day. We went down to Indian Gardens, 9 miles rt, starting at 6am and arrived about 8am, hitting about a 1.5 miles every 30 minutes on average with stops for photos. However, the way up took twice as long, about one hour for every 1.5 miles, and by the time we reached the surface at 11:15 am, there was barely any shade left. We were fortunate to have cooler weather for our hike (about 60 degrees at Indian Garden when we were there) but we were still very warm due to the exertion of going up 3,000ft. When we were at Indian Garden, we overheard people asking for directions to the colorado river, which was another 4 miles away, effectively making it a 17ish mile round trip which was far too long to do in a day by the time they arrived. If you're hoping to go down to the river, either spend the night in phantom ranch (which books up far in advance) or leave very early in the morning with headlamps on. We also saw quite a very people in sandals, flip flops, carrying purses and not paying attention to where they were going and what they were doing, and even saw someone need helicopter rescue at Indian Gardens while we were on our ascent. Do not be fooled, this is a hiking trail through and through, and planning ahead for that will save you a lot of agony. Overall, we felt like this was the quintessential experience for hikers wanting to truly experience the grand canyon more than just gawking, but if you're not prepared you will regret it."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Bright Angel Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Not for the out of shape,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of if not the most popular trail that actually goes into the canyon.  First time I was there, I was confused to discover it gets hotter as you go deeper.  Apparently cold does not sink at the GC.  And apparently I was not the only one who didn't realize this.  We came across dozens and dozens of people who looked like they were seriously about to die within the top quarter mile of this trail.  So I strongly advise staying on the rim if you are not in shape.  While it was only about 80 degrees on the rim, it quickly rose above 90 not far below it, and was over 100 down by the river.  If you are in shape for it though, this is one of the best hikes in the west."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon South Rim,Canyons,5.0,The views do not disappoint!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were staying with family in Sun City (near the Phoenix airport) and drove in our rental vehicle the approximate 3.5 hour drive to the south entrance of the Grand Canyon.  The park entrance was easy to find.  Parking this year was $35/vehicle.  I was skeptical going in, as several friends had this excursion on their ""bucket list"" while others simply raved.  I worried I would be disappointed.  However, the views absolutely spectacular!  We self-guided/toured.  We both experienced some vertigo and were careful to hang on to the railings provided, or sit on available benches as needed. Also bring water.  With the high elevation, it is easier to get winded, and water helps. We did have a hiker in front of us fall a few times from experiencing vertigo,and with assistance from others were able to help him get off the stairs and onto level ground to sit down.  He was embarrassed but grateful.  It could (and does) happen to anyone.  There were some areas that were roped off due to ice and snow and I was amazed how many people stupidly ignored the warnings and bypassed the barriers to get closer to the edge of the Canyon for selfies!   Check the weather in advance and dress appropriately.  The temperature was 30 degrees cooler in the Canyon than in the Phoenix area.  There were many families present and some pushing young ones in strollers.  On Feb 10, it was a chilly, windy, 40 degrees F.   There are lots of signs at various points educating you on the history of rocks, the Colorado river running through the Canyon, etc., and a small museum you can enter about 1.5 hours into the walk.  After our hike, we were exhausted and wind blown, and caught a shuttle back to the parking lot.  Kudos to those who can manage to walk the entire thing.  We didn't see everything the south side had to offer.  In our vehicle, we exited the park from the east side and for some 50+ miles, still saw the Grand Canyon from out the driver's side window. There were several spots along the way to stop and take more photos.  All in all, it was a physically and mentally stimulating journey that I highly recommend."

I took an 8 day escorted tour of the Southwest in September. I have never seen the Grand Canyon but that day, I really saw it! Our tour guide gave everyone a bandana and we were told to wear it as we formed a conga-line through the gift shop out and to the edge of canyon. I was speechless and I couldn’t move, I just stared. You can’t describe it, it’s like nothing that I could ever imagine! Totally breathtaking! And it was the best travel experience of my year!!"
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon South Rim,Canyons,5.0,Crazy Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our second day in Sedona, we headed the 95 miles to the south rim of the Grand Canyon to check one more thing off our bucket list.  The drive was about two hours as the first part had road construction and a section of 15 mph turns, but once you got thru that the roads were straight.  My National Park Pass that I paid $10 for paid for itself as the car cost was $35.  $20 if you had a 62 year old that has an American ID.  Pictures do not do this place justice.  We were told to visit Bryce Canyon and when I asked at the Visitor's Center, the man told me it was a 6 hour drive.  The canyon is beyond believe.  Made me nervous as you can actually stand on the edge to take pictures and selfies.  We stayed with the railing areas.  A family asked us to take their picture on the ledge and we did but there are too many crazy people that could push you off the ledge and kids have been known to break away from a parents hold and run.  There are three stops by car.  Grand Canyon Village, The Desert section and the main one.  We went to all three.  A train comes into Grand Canyon Village and you can get a shuttle to the other places.  We drove our Jeep that we rented.  Great day in a great place.  We may plan a trip to the North Ridge in the future that includes Bryce.  You can hike the ridge if you would like."

Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon South Rim,Canyons,5.0,Grand Canyon Desert View Drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I would first like to thank the National Park Service.  Our car entered the Grand Canyon free.  My husband only had to show his drivers license which indicated he is a veteran.  We were issued an America The Beautiful Pass which gives us free admission to The National Parks .   (We then used it again in Page to access Lake Powell)   We rented our car at PHX airport and drove to the South Rim entrance.   I can’t comment on the drive really , it was pouring rain so I didn’t  see much of anything and I’m sure it slowed us down .  However upon our arrival the sky at the Grand  Canyon  was clearing and the sun was starting to peek out.   We arrived at 4pm and started our drive along Desert View Drive .  First stop Mather Point…there is a walkway there and you could spent a bit of time there.  We made several more stops along Desert View Drive … Duck on a Rock , Grandview Point, Moran Point to name a few before arriving at Lipan Point for sunset ….it was perfect weather and perfect timing  for sunset.  The drive along Desert View took us 2 hours with several stops/path walking before reaching Lipan Point.  There is so much to do and see if you want to hike, raft, mule ride etc but our drive along Desert View left me with drop dead gorgeous pictures, a feeling of awe and peacefulness and an experience that I recommend everyone have.  There were no crowds and the weather was perfect which aided my experience .   My experience was exactly what I wanted however I realize some desire more.  Exiting Lipan Point we headed to Page AZ to continue our adventuring!   Page was another 2 -2.5 hours from Lipan Point in total darkness.  If you make the trip onward to Page know that there is only one place to stop for gas / food along the way and that is about an hour down the road."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon South Rim,Canyons,5.0,It’s A Grand Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My family took our first trip together to the Grand Canyon.  We really enjoyed it.  We stayed just outside the park so we got in early.  We tried to beat the heat with an early morning hike and an evening hike.  Both down into the canyon.  We went 1.5 miles on each hike.  Down and back was pretty easy for my two teens and I.  To go 3 miles down you should be in pretty good shape because even 1.5 miles down was 1100 feet of elevation change.  The views on the canyon trails are amazing.
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon South Rim,Canyons,5.0,A Foggy Wet Day,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although I could recognize the majesty and beauty of the Grand Canyon, we ended up there on a wet, cold, foggy, rainy afternoon. (It wasn't supposed to rain until much later in the day, but that's Mother Nature) This certainly detracted from our views.  However, as we were there we were determined to see something, although we couldn't see very deep into the canyon. First stop was the visitor center for some ranger suggestions and orientation maps to the Grand Canyon, which was celebrating it 100th  anniversary year.  Then a wet walk to Mather's Point for viewing whatever we could.  We road the free shuttle bus over to Yavapai Geology Museum, which was interesting and informative about geological history of the area.  And could have given us some great view points if it weren't for the rain. Will have to plan to try again on a better weather day."
Grand Canyon National Park,Arizona (AZ),Grand Canyon South Rim,Canyons,5.0,Beautiful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I can’t imagine the canyon not looking beautiful. The colors are constantly changing due to the sun. This is definitely something one should see at least once in their lifetime. A few tips. Right now masks are required within the park, though I did see some without. It’s best to go early in the morning (by 9am) to avoid long lines at the main entrance, assure a parking spot, and avoid lots of people huddled at the viewpoints. Also, due to COVID the entrance fee is online only. If you haven’t purchased a pass online before you arrive the park employee will give you what you need to pay on their website after you enter the park. But be warned... internet is not going to happen while you’re in the park. I can only imagine how many are not paying the fee and not once was I ever asked to show proof of payment. "

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Bowman Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Great relaxing day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Visited Bowman Lake after a visit to Polebridge Mercantile because a couple of local folks said it was their favorite place in GNP. Was a perfect relaxing (i.e., non-hiking) day. The 6-mile access road is DUSTY right now and takes a while to travel. Was plenty of parking when we went because the were in pre-evacuation for wildfires, which kept most folks away.  Was still gorgeous even with wildfire smoke obscuring the distant views."

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Bowman Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,One of the Gems of Glacier National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This lake is a wonderful destination if you're visiting Glacier National Park and you're not afraid of some dirt roads.  It's accessed through the Polebridge area entrance, and there is a primitive campground there that was first come first served at the time of year we visited, which was just after Labor Day.  I believe the campground closes up fairly quickly for the winter, so make sure it's still open if you're on that threshold at the end of the season.  If you have a kayak or canoe, take it with you!  The water is crystal clear and the mountain surrounding the lake are awe inspiring."

I won't say the road is very dusty, narrow and at places rough but it is a beautiful place to visit.  There is hiking trails from the lake and you can hike around the lake.  They have picnic tables for having a picnic lunch and a beach to play in the water if you would enjoy doing that.  It does not require the pass so if you did not get one this is a area you can freely explore.  And be sure to stop off at Polebridge Mercantile and enjoy the huckleberry bearclaws they are delicious."

We went to continue on to Bowman Lake since the roads were not bad for us in a truck.  However, we couldn’t get in because you now need a vehicle reservation pass.  We did not realize this and everyone in the past reviews said you didn’t need one.  Plus there is no Wi-Fi there so you couldn’t even try to get one.   Otherwise it would have been nice to see. Could not really rate it since we couldn’t go."

Very beautiful lake and location. Not as spectacular as the other parts of the park, but still definitely worth the trip. A beautiful lake surrounded by glacier-carved mountains.  Way less crowded than the other parts of the park. A nice restaurant and gift shop as well. We were passing by in our travels and stopped in at Two Medicine since we'd never been to this part of the park before. It was worth the drive just to sit and look at the lake and feel the afternoon winds blow across the waters into our face. However, suggestions for cool things to do if you have a half day here include:  "

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Two Medicine Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Glacier in July,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you go to Two Medicine take the road from East Glacier. The road from the north is in sad shape and no guardrails either. Two Medicine is old school National Park with few amenities and a rustic appearance.  The natural beauty is enough to camp there. The lake was closed to all boats so check the Glacier NP website prior to taking your kayaks up to the lake. We did not camp or stay in the area. We drove down from Babb where we stayed at Chewing Black Bones RV park which is a Blackfeet Campground. Good access to Many Glacier and Going to the Sun road. East side of Glacier is more of  rural experience compared to the tourist trap that is West Glacier. If you come for the beauty though you will enjoy it regardless which side is your base camp. Week saw a 2 year old grizzly bear, a mountain goat with kid and 6 big horn sheep after8:00 pm on the same evening. Happy Camping."

Great tour guide over on the boat. I wish I remembered her name. Petite young lady with dark brown/black hair. Very knowledgeable and gave lots of information about the area and the Blackfeet Tribe. We enjoyed our boat ride across. We did get off to hike the .09 miles to Twin Falls. It was an easy hike through the woods. Spray as bugs were a little bad. We did encounter a Moose eating about 10’ off of the trail & A bear (may have been 2). We did walk as a group & one lady In front of us saw a bear & alerted those ahead who were closer. The man a few minutes later saw a Bear stand up & peer over the bushes. Either way we were fine. We did ALL stop for a bit to allow them time to move. Moose looked at us, but kept on eating. We all quietly walked as far around as path allowed. It was gone on our return. "

I am so glad we took the time to get to this gorgeous area of the park.  We had tickets for the GTSR and figured it would be crowded with those who didn't (they weren't required to get into this part of park) but that those people would be leaving by around 4 pm to get to the GTSR once it opened for non-ticket holders. this seemed to be the case as we arrived about 3:45 and had no trouble finding a spot.  There are several restrooms in the area as well. enjoyed our boat tour which will be reviewed separately.

Ride was smooth despite a windy day.  Get there early as we had a reservation, but they give away seats 10 minutes before leaving (we were about 8 minutes early).  It ended up working out anyway, but was news to us after booking through Amtrak.  We also did the hike to the point and falls which were fairly easy compared to others we did in glacier."

The rain gods attention was centered on the west side so we drove across Logan Pass to take advantage of sunshine on the east side. The hike was nice and the scenery’s awesome. The total hike’s about 3.5 miles and it’s never too steep. The combo of Going to the Sun Road, St. Mary’s Falls, views of St. Mary’s Lake and Virginia Falls make for a great day!"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Virginia Falls,Waterfalls,5.0,Highlight of our Going To The Sun Road journey,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We thought we might do this hike on our last day in the park hearing it was on the eastern side.  However, on this day that we devoted to a journey of the Going To The Sun Road on the east side (portions only open during late June 2021), we stopped the car to venture to the falls today.  What a pleasant surprise. We were able to take in three falls on this fairly easy hike. The entire journey was quite splendid, though the best, was clearly saved for last when we reached the gushing Virginia Falls.  The spray is far reaching - you might even come prepared with a rain jacket if you plan to get up close. A great place for photos throughout the entire hike. These falls were the highlight of today’s travel day."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Virginia Falls,Waterfalls,5.0,Beautiful Hike to Distant Falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We started our hike to Virginia Falls from the Saint Mary Falls parking area.  You always get a bit worried when your hike starts by going downhill for a long distance...as you know that you need to return on this same path.  But it eventually leads to the beautiful waters of Saint Mary Falls.  But don't stop there!  Keep going and start your climb up to Virginia Falls.  You will have seen them in the distance when you started your hike...once you get there you will be so glad you did it.  So tall and beautiful...and a great place to cool off after the uphill hike!  Then you start your return trek back to Saint Mary Falls where we spent more time to really enjoy the colors of the water in this area.  Then back to the uphill climb to the car.  Bring hiking poles to help make the hike a bit easier.

Another .8 of a mile is Virginia Falls which is much bigger and besides, along the way there are several other falls.  it's an easy walk.  I'm sure it's much better at this time of year with the spring runoff but still would be beautiful anytime."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Virginia Falls,Waterfalls,5.0,Awesome Falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I went in mid September 2022.   The water volume was a little light but that actually made for some great pictures.   The  walk was not too strenuous for this 67 year old with a bum knee.  Did get a little winded from the altitude.  I had taken my jacket off after the first half mile of the trail as I was hot.  Near the top it was back on and I wished I had brought my gloves.  The colors of the rocks were amazing.  Well worth every step of the hike.

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Virginia Falls,Waterfalls,5.0,A Must See !!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked by St Mary’s Fall’s parking. It took a little bit to be able to park. Have patience. There are multiple falls on this hike. It’s 3.5 miles RT to Virginia Falls. It’s fairly easy going on the way to St Mary’s Falls, then gets a little tougher. The return is a moderate hike back at times. You will walk through the remains of the 2015 Reynolds fire. So no shade until you pass St Mary’s.  There are 3 beautiful falls along the hike & a few very small ones. Don’t confuse any with The Virginia Falls… it’s a 100 foot tall fall. Once there you can go right to view close up & then after coming down take the little cut off to see the whole falls… The Virginia and the numerous little ones farther down. It’s actually very breezy & cool up top which was a welcomed relief. Truly beautiful falls & so worth seeing!!"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Virginia Falls,Waterfalls,5.0,Great hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very beautiful hike with several waterfalls along the way.

The scenes that this phone captured were beautiful although the trek was very steep. The trail was probably a bit hard, but I think anyone would be able to do it. I think I’m exacerbating how hard the trail was. In truth, it’s a very scenic and beautiful trail that anyone should try. I mean, I even saw some families with 8 year olds doing it! PS: the final mile is a walk through snow and it gets pretty wind chilly at the top so I would recommend bringing a windbreaker and pants to put on."

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Iceberg Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,fabulous  iceberg lake trail. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What a fun hike. Took us a little over 2 hours to get to the Lake. The hike is in and out. Mostly continuous uphill to get there but it is relatively low incline. You first go through forest, then the side of the mountain. Wildflowers everywhere. It is a beautiful walk. There are several watery areas that you must cross. The last 1/2 mile is through snow. Trudging through snow is tiring. This is not a very hard hike. There is a small but fast running river that you must balance over 2 logs to get over. There is a very nice fall at the half way point about 2.6 mi point. Can take a small break there. Iceberg Lake is a must see! Incredibly beautiful. We arrive at the lake before 9am and there was only 2 other people. On our way back is mostly downhill. I would do this hike again!"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Iceberg Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,A great day hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Iceberg Lake was one of my favorite day hikes I did during my 6-day stay at Glacier National Park in July 2006.  This hike was the highlight of the day, July 4th, capped off by fireworks in Kalispell.  The trail begins at the Swiftcurrent Motor Inn and gains a significant amount of elevation in its first 1/2 mile.  After the initial climb, the trail is a very gradual climb with breathtaking scenery.  Immediately, great views of the Swiftcurrent Valley are unfolded alongside beautiful wildflowers.  Next, the trail enters some forested areas before arriving at Ptarmigan Falls.  The waterfall is not easily visible from the trail, but you know it's there.  You cross Ptarmigan Creek just above the Falls.  Not long after the waterfall, the trail splits, left heads toward Iceberg Lake and right heads toward Ptarmigan Lake and Tunnel.  Ptarmigan Lake/Tunnel is a great side trip for those with more ambitious day hiking goals.  The Tunnel is particularly desirable, as it provides a breathtaking overlook to the Belly River Valley to  the North on its North side.  Continuing along the Iceberg Lake Trail, you exit the forest and the 3,000-foot cliffs surrounding the Iceberg Lake cirque come into view.  Here the open slops to the left and right of the trail provide great chances for spotting grizzlies, so keep on the lookout.  After some more climbing, you final crest a small ridge and get your first glimpse of the lake a couple hundred yards away...beautiful!  The icebergs remain floating in the lake through August.  It is a beautiful sight, and one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.  Being encompassed by 3000-foot cliffs on three sides is an amazing experience.  After spending an hour or two sitting along the shore or dipping your feet in the icy water, it's time to retrace your steps back down the trail.  In total the hike is 9 miles and gains 1,200 feet, making it a trail suitable for most day hikers.  This is definitely one of the best choices for a hike in Glacier and deserves special consideration.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

After the initial ascent the trail is fairly gentle.  You'll pass through several types of terrain, from alpine meadow to cedar and pine woods that smell amazing, with lots of beautiful views out across the glacier-dug valley.  There's quite a bit of water crossing the trail, as the peaks to the north are around 1500' above the trail and carry snow year-round in places, so bring some good hiking footwear.  Also bring your filter and fill your flask from the glacier meltwater!  In early September there were still a good bit of thimbleberries and huckleberries to snack on as well.  There's even a rather... rustic... pit toilet on a little spur about halfway to the lake."

As available trail guides indicate, the only serious, strenuous climb is in the first 200 yards, so don't get discouraged.  The rest of the 5.0 miles is mainly gentle ups and downs (More ups since you have to go up about another 1100'.  We had no bear sightings, though the trail is rated A+ for griz.  Keep in mind that the bears do not subscribe to such ratings and are free to roam where they wish.  Apparently, they wished to be near the trail before our hike, and the next day when the trail was closed due to bear activity (The NPS wants you to see bears from a distance.  If they are close enough to harm you, or for you to annoy them, and the NPS is aware of it, they close the area).  Apparently, this trail is so A+ for griz that it experiences fairly frequent, temporary closures.  "

The first part from the trailhead is through the trees, and has some quick moderate elevation gain - also some larger steps.  Then you break out of the trees into an open section that has great panoramic views of the surrounding valley and peaks.  Many of the hikers were stopping at Ptarmigan Falls for a break.  The last part of the trail has a meadows area, and a short ridge to hike over.  Once at the lake, there are many little trails that branch off - where you might find your own piece of the shoreline."

We got to the trailhead at 7:00 am to get parking and got one of the last spots.  When you start the hike if you go counterclockwise at the fork (so not on boardwalk) you will pass a bathroom building along the way.  Then you can take the fork the other way on way back to car when you leave.   The hike itself is through the woods and shaded the whole time, with no real views of any mountains until you get towards the end.  But the end is amazing.  We picnicked at the first lake/beach area.  When we got there the sun was just coming up over the mountain and cast a shadow over most of the “picture opportunities” at the lake.  It would’ve been prettier later in the day.  I’m hindsight we would’ve taken the shuttle to go later.  Highly recommend to keep walking the extra mile or so to the very end of the trail on the other side of the lake.  The lake views were just gorgeous from that side, the mountains reflected on the clear water and no shadows from that side."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Avalanche Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Avalanche lake via Trail of the Cedars,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hike. Moderate difficulty, good for all hikers. Parked at trailhead. Staying left  on trail of the cedars takes you past avalanche creek just before the avalanche lake trailhead. The other side of the TOTC has bathrooms with running water. The lake was nice despite being overcast and we had lunch here. We enjoyed walking along the lakeside rather than the trail after reaching lake. Everyone in our party enjoyed, would recommend."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Avalanche Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Gorgeous Avalanche Lake is a fairly easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Avalanche lake is a scenic, fairly easy hike. The path is heavily wooded, and it provides peek-through views of the mountains and interesting river watching.  The gem is the lake near the end.  Many people stop there and turn around after a few photos. After soaking up the lake view, if you’d like to feel a little more remote, continue on the path past the lake.  It goes on another .5 or .75 miles or so.  Try to arrive early or you’ll have a difficult time getting parking by the trailhead.  It’s popular… for good reason."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Avalanche Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Fantastic scenic reward at end of crowded hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"A 2-ish-mile steady climb up a well-graded trail that culminates in a spectacular cirque lake. This was a very worthwhile hike, despite the crowds we met along the way. I recommend that you arrive at the trailhead as early as possible. We got there at 8am and had a tough time finding a place to park. The large number of people at the lake detracted from the experience."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Must Do Trail in Glacier ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a very popular trail in Glacier NP. It is about three miles round trip and can be a bit strenuous due to some elevation. It is just behind the visitors center. Be aware of bears as there are warning signs everywhere. Views are iconic. Parking is very challenging but we were fortunate to find something pretty easy in a very full lot around 11 am. Just be patient and wait for someone to leave. 
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Awesome views, but overrated",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked this on an absolutely beautiful day - great weather and we were excited to finish our week on a high note.  We weren't all that impressed considering the great reviews.  Since the buses weren't running, we went about 4 miles in and turned around, but I don't think we missed much.  In normal circumstances, you can hike to the Loop from Logan, but the reviews on the last 4-5 miles on that didn't sound great either.  The views are amazing - absolutely.  But the views don't change much throughout the route so it's just a lot of walking with lots of other people.  Compared to other options at GNP (we much preferred Avalanche Lake and St. Mary's/Victoria Falls earlier in the week), I'd choose something else, or just go 2 miles in and turnaround to get the most out of your time rather than invest a full day."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,WILD!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is crazy fun, very narrow in parts with a steep drop off, not for the faint of heart, especially since it can get a little windy.  Park at Logan's Pass - take your time finding a spot, people are always leaving you just need to be patient.  Fun trail, different where you have to hold on to a garden house that's affixed to the wall for you to hold as you traverse the narrow high line passage to get to the other side of the trail.  You can do just 2 miles of it and still love it. "
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Go early!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"How beautiful!  This is a great trail, but like so many in Glacier, you must go early.  We got to Logan Pass at 7:10 AM and got one of the few remaining parking spaces.  To facilitate this, if you’re staying in St Mary you will be far closer to Logan Pass than if you stay in West Glacier, Columbia Falls or Whitefish.  By going early you also get the benefit of hiking in the morning sun, and watching the light change as it dances on the mountains.  When you return to Logan Pass, cars will be circling looking to take your spot!"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Don’t go if it’s foggy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We wanted to go on this trail for the views but ended up sitting in the car all morning waiting for the fog to lift. With low clouds and fog you will get no view whatsoever. When it cleared we hiked the first mile or so which has the best views and they’re spectacular! The hike is not strenuous but if you’re nervous about heights you will not be happy here. The trial is so narrow in places you’ll have to go single file while holding onto a cable bolted to the side of the cliff. You’ll look out over the road below across the mountains to the horizon. Highly recommended! 
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Unique trail with wide views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Much of this trail is along a ridge line allowing wide and distant views. It’s moderately difficult with lots of rocky areas. It’s just off the Logan Pass visitor center parking lot. We saw a few mountain goats right off the trail 
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Magnificent Hike from Logan’s Pass to Granite Park Chalet,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I hiked the Highline Trail from Logan’s Pass to Granite Park Chalet. I used the Loop Trail to hike out to the Going-to-the-Sun Road for about 12 miles of total hiking. The Highline Trail runs along the Garden Wall with stunning views at every turn. Wildflowers were blooming everywhere along the trail and hillsides. The trail is pretty exposed along most of it’s length so bug spray and sunscreen are musts. I also had to cross two snow fields even in July. The trail is strenuous in some spots but not for long distances. There was tons of wildlife along the trail including mountain goats, marmots, and pikas. The one downside was the Loop Trail was extremely strenuous to descend compared to the Highline Trail itself. That is something to take into account when hiking from Logan Pass to the Loop as I did."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best (difficult) hike to-do,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked from Logan Pass to the side-track to Grinnell Glacier Overlook, then to the Chalet, and ending at The Loop parking lot (shuttle bus stop); total 14 miles, definitely strenuous hiking! The best trail out there, but be ready to experience elevation gain. Especially after 7 miles when you do the Grinnell Glacier overlook, it's ""only"" 0.8 miles uphill, however extremely steep, but the view is extraordinary. Two days later we did the Grinnell Glacier hike from Many Glacier, and it is great to see where you went. This is a one-way hike we did, so we bought tickets to get on the shuttle bus at The Loop. Do not underestimate the length and difficulty of this hike; the last 4 miles we did from the Chalet to The Loop is all downhill, and very challenging for your knees."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Simply Amazing!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Loved this trail!  Up way before dawn to make the trip to Logan Pass and secure a parking spot.  Hubby and I are 57 and 59-we had only planned on going to Haystack Butte, but fell in love with the trail and ended up hiking the entire trail! The views were simply amazing!! We had read about how unpleasant the last 4 miles are-all downhill and no shade.  Definitely harder on the knees, but we actually enjoyed it.   We were concerned about the possible wait time for the shuttle at The Loop. We ended up waiting about 35 minutes.  We heard from others that their wait times were much longer."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Highline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,One of the best hikes in North America,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a five star attraction with two huge caveats.   One, and most importantly, the first quarter mile is quite scary.   There is a huge drop-off with only a railing on the other side to hold onto.  It's very safe but not for everyone.   Second, getting there and back is a total hassle.  Budget at least 90-120 minutes each way.  If you get there at 7 AM and have a GTTS pass.  You're all set.  For the rest of us, there is a very poor shuttle system or taking a chance on parking.   That said, once you get out there the experience and the views are unbeatable.   It's tought to get there given the weather conditions, etc.   "
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Gorgeous but beware - large part of the trail is covered in snow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took this beautiful hike early in the morning (we got to the park at 5:30am to watch a sunrise over Lake McDonald) so there was plenty of parking. It is a gorgeous hike with mountain flowers, a beautiful lake and plenty of wildlife - we saw mountain goats, rams and marmots. But beware - a large part of the trail is covered in snow so bring hiking boots and/or snow sticks as otherwise it can be quite slippery. "
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Mountain goats and beautiful flowers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the best National parks in the USA. Amazing drive to the LOgan pass with river/lake on the side where ppl were kayaking on their own. Nice trails along the drive, You can spot bears easily. Lot of mountain goats. Lots of beautiful flowers. Carry your boniculars to spot grizzlies. Keep a bear spray. You will also find snow at the trail. There is a small lake a the top of logan pass. Its a kid friendly hike. I hiked with 8 and 6yrs old. The parking is tight so you might not find spot easily and park on the road side and walk to the trails. Public restrooms are clean. Lot of park rangers everywhere to help and guide. Its a crowded National Park so please carry your masks and your own Water bottles on the hikes.  Not all trails at the Glacier Park are kid friendly so read the map before you go on hikes. There are two entrances- West and East,right before you head to the entrace there is a small strip mall area where you can pick up food and water. There are no food options inside the park. Also there is no cell phone signal inside the park. A 7 day pass is the most economic way to go for $35."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,GO EARLY,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We got there at 6:30am and the parking lot was half full. We got maybe  15 minutes  into our hike heading towards Hidden Lake and looked back and it was a sea of cars and the parking lot was full. So glad we went early. You see more of the wild life coming down the mountain and the  sun peaking over . You can't  hike the whole trail at this time due to it closing. The fish are spawning and the bears are in that area. You do make it to the over look.   This is an easy hike to do. The fist little  bit is up but after that it mellows out to the overlook.  Make sure you have proper  shoes for there is still packed snow in places and you will slide. Smooth sole shoes are not recommended!! 
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Late afternoon get you parking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes, parking is tough unless you get there before 7AM or after 3:30.  Both days we went in the late afternoon, which made for easy parking.  It may be tough to do Hidden Lake at that time but with smaller kids, we were not planning the whole hike anyway.  We did the first part of the Highline Trail which has great views, but has steep drop offs."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Great for the views and trails,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got lucky and found a parking place in the early afternoon, but it took a few minutes."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Cold and rainy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,There is some real breathtaking views of the glacially carved mountains.  The road is narrow with sharp curves I was scared we was me going to go off the edge of the mountain.  It was 55°F with a big dark cloud pouring down cold rain.  We saw a bicyclist come barrelling down the pass about 40 mph in the cold rain wearing biker shorts and a camelback water harness.  That was the silliest thing we saw in GNP.
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Logan Pass: Highline trail to Garden trail and Grinnell glacier overlook,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hiked Highline to the Garden trail and up to the Grinnell glacier. Amazing views. Highly recommend. Strenuous hike if going to glacier. If you choose to go to glacier also recommend Loop trail to get back to Sun road as mostly downhill. 10/10
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Highly recommend,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A must do attraction in GNP.  We hiked a portion of Highline trail and also the Hidden Lake overlook trail.  We were there in early Sept on a Friday.  We got up very early, arrived at Logan Pass at 7:15am, and the lot was already full!  We headed westbound 1/2 mile and parked at a pull off.  It only holds about 10 cars, so I'm sure it filled up shortly after we parked."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Once you find parking a great wildlife viewing spot!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The con’s - parking is truly a nightmare as many of mentioned or this would have gotten a five star review.  Not sure what the answer is.  I know it would look terrible but parking garage??   It is just a shame that more people can’t enjoy this amazing location.   We got lucky finding a spot around 3 pm one day.  Another time we got there at 11 AM and no parking and the last time when we wanted to do the Hidden Lake Overlook Trail we left our cabin in Coram at 5:30 AM and arrived at Logan’s Pass at 7:25 AM to get one of the last spots available.   The drive was slow due to the 18 miles of torn up roads near Lake McDonald.  We got lucky to see Big-Horn Sheep twice.  They are positively majestic!    We were there the week of July 2nd and a bit surprised that most of the wildflowers were done.  There were a few still hanging on but not like some photos I had seen in previous years.
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Logan Pass,Valleys,4.5,Don’t Miss!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We stopped at Logan Pass twice and drove through four times on the Going to the Sun Road during our visit to Glacier National Park. Logan Pass was definitely a highlight. It was literally pouring on our first day and we drove from the West Entrance around the park to the sunny East side. The plan worked until we returned through Logan Pass. The clouds descended and we crossed in the soup with very poor visibility. The views were awesome when we crossed the next day to hike to St. Mary’s and Virginia Falls.
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,Lake Serenity ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This picture was taken at 5:30 AM on July 3. This Lake is large with spectacular views no matter where you are situated. Boating, canoeing, kayaking, fishing and hiking around this lake are recommended activities. Swimming, for people who are okay with extra chilled waters, is an option."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,Amazing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Apgar is the perfect campground-it definitely felt like we were away but not stranded. Lake McDonald was like a postcard, and we rented kayaks to get a little more up close with nature. Every one of the ranger programs was excellent, and every ranger we spoke to was helpful and excited to help us find a way to experience GNP. Going To The Sun Road was, as promised, breathtaking and a bit harrowing. Definitely get to Logan Pass early (before 9am) or take a shuttle, and hike to Hidden Lake or it’s overlook. The east side felt a little more forgotten. St Mary Lake is gorgeous! Tent-camped in St Mary for the second half of our stay, showers not operational and no one could give us info about where there might be working showers. Beautiful views & saw a grizzly. "
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,Large and long lake at the West entrance to park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lake McDonald is usually the first sight viewed by visitors to the park and it doesn't disappoint.

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,Spectacular lake and views - take advantage of Glacier Park Boat rides.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stunning lake and scenery.  We took a Glacier Park boat ride to savor the beauty of this remote jewel.  The guides on the boats are always informative but we so enjoyed the views, even though it was raining and windy.  The Glacier Parks boats are works of art in themselves and beautifully maintained, the friendly crew and boats are always ready to go out because of the enclosed seating area/cabin in any weather.  In Glacier NP in mid June we had every weather, wind, rain, a snow shower and a magnificent pair of thunderstorms.  Dress accordingly in layers!  We took 4 boat rides and booked all of them in advance, although you can usually call early in the morning for openings."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,We could just stay there playing with the pebbles...,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's everything you see on the internet photos and then some. As you drive along the lake in the evening, pick a pull-out with no other cars, bring your chair to the shore and breathe it in. My children would've still be there if I let them (we were there over a week ago). Once the lake ends and the creek begins, the pebbles get bigger, but the scenery continues to infuse you with peace. So glad we got to see it!"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful lake to just hang out and enjoy the views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our family vacationed at Whitefish, MT and Glacier National Park for a week.  Whenever we would come into the park to hike, we would pass Lake McDonald on the way in driving to the parking area for our hike.  On the last day of our trip, we were trying to decide what to do in the afternoon, and finally decided to head back to this picturesque lake as our destination, instead of just driving by.  We did not go out onto the lake in a boat, but just parked in one of the pull-off areas, walked through a short wooded trail, and sat lakeside with our feet in the water.  The water is very cool and felt wonderful to us after days of hiking.  It's also fun to just sit there and go through all of the small, smooth, round multicolor rocks that rim the lake.  We just relaxed and took photos of the area for awhile.  We only saw 3 other people the whole time we were there.  A nice relaxing way to spend the final afternoon of our trip."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,Gorgeous and relaxing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This lake has healing powers! We hiked 3 hours prior, and we hike our kids played in the water.. we soaked out feet and skipped rocks. This iconic lake really does look like fruity pebbles and with a little “photoshop” the lake rocks pop vibrantly. We think the water was around 55-60° when we went late June. The view is spectacular and it’s very relaxing! Highly recommend a stop here!"
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful crystal clear lake with mountains in the background,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Lake McDonald was our first impression of Glacier National Park.  Oh my-what an impression it made! The crystal clear water and mountains in the background.  You must park and walk down to the lake and sit and simply enjoy the view.  Dip your feet in the chilly water. Play with the pebble stones.  The simple things in life are the best. We stayed in Whitefish and drove to the park each day of our vacation. The view from Apgar Village is beautiful.  There is a restaurant at Lake McDonald lodge but DT COVID it is only open to guests staying at the lodge
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Lake McDonald,Bodies of Water,4.5,Spent a night outside/flat tire,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful! Be cautious, it’s easy to get a flat tire as the road has sharp edges around the lake if you go off a bit. We got a flat one and no service/no spare tire either. Rangers helped us to get to the city.

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Grinnell Glacier,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Only go on a sunny day, very steep",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I had seen many reviews with carribean blue water. I'm not sure how much were filters and how much was real. I went on a very cloudy day, so the lake looked slightly blue, not like the pictures. The hike was very difficult. I'm pretty healthy and do cardio workouts regularly. We had to pull over a few times just for me to breathe.                              We continued thinking just a little further to the end, but it kept going. It was 1.25 miles high. My 11 year old thought but was ok and my 8 year old was miserable. We went in September and it was snow cold. My husband and I loved the views from high up on the mountain and we were thankful for an adventure. The lake itself was not exciting on a cloudy day. We loved the Cedar walk water and a turn off. The water there was green and really gorgeous (even on a cloudy day.) If you like mountain hiking, it's warm and sunny, or you really like challenging yourself you might love this."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Grinnell Glacier,Hiking Trails,5.0,Stunning!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike at the end of the July and it wasn’t open all the way to the top.

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Grinnell Glacier,Hiking Trails,5.0,Grinning at Grinnell,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Start hike early so you finish before dark. 10.4 miles round trip. We didn’t start until 10:30 finished at 7:30 pm. I’m 51, hubby is 53 not in tip too shape but we made it. Recommend taking at least 2 bottles water per person, separate packs and a water filtration system to bring water from glacier lake for hike back. We saw a family of rams, pica, bunnies, squirrels. The view was best I seen in Glacier. Very popular hike. You can cut down the hike by 3 miles by taking the two boats at hotel at Many glacier. It is a popular cruise so make reservations well in advance. These will get you in the park also without a car reservation in case you don’t have that during summer months. There was a wonderful waterfall we passed and got a little wet. We notice some dry riverbeds in August on way up so if it’s spring be prepared for some more waterfalls to cross over. Boots recommended and I used poles. Last 1/4 mile of hike is hardest, straight up with lots of stairs. Take it easy and enjoy it. Well worth the hike! Absolutely stunning!!"

The first boat takes you across Swiftcurrent Lake, followed by a short hike over a hill to Josephine Lake, where a second boat takes you across Josephine Lake.   You then hike approximately 0.4 miles to the junction of the Grinnell Glacier Trail and then it is all up for the next 3.5 miles."

Hang in there, the last climb to view the glacier and lake was tough but the views made up for it. Enjoy the  spray from the waterfall it was refreshing.   Bring lots of water, food and I recommend walking sticks.  We are both 50+ and our poles were helpful stepping up and down over the rocky terrain.  It took us 7 hours to complete but we stopped to take pictures,  took time to take in the views and spent about 30 minutes relaxing by the lake  We didn't want to rush through this hike."

Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Grinnell Glacier,Hiking Trails,5.0,Incredible vies and the end-point is rewarding,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This 13 mile hike from Many Glacier to upper Grinnell Glacier (actually stand where the glacier ends and goes into the first lake) is awesome, but strenuous. Older kids will love it, some folks jumped in the ice-lake. The views during the hike are great, and also refreshing (you have to walk through a small waterfall). When at the Glacier, look up, and see (small) the hikers who did the Highline Trail, and the Grinnell Overlook addition (see our review).  And absolute must; you will be tired after a day long good elevation gain hike."
Glacier National Park,Montana (MT),Grinnell Glacier,Hiking Trails,5.0,Great Hike - Moderate Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful hike.  Quite a bit of elevation gain.  Recommend you plan your trip well in advance and book your space on the boats from Many Glacier.  The boats will cut out 4 miles of the 11 mile trail.  We were too late in requesting reservations (7 weeks prior to our trip) and had to hike around Swiftcurrent and Josephine lakes.

Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Discovery Tour,Sightseeing Tours,4.0,Great for time and money!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you make the mistake of not booking a tour early and arrive at the park expecting to see caves, then this tour is for you. Only$5, self-guided, and not strenuous, this tour allows you to see the beautiful cave at your own speed. Although the initial stairs are steep, most of the tour is easy walking. The tour loops back up the same trail, so the hike back up the stairs and to the park station may tax some, but there are several places to stop and rest. This is great for people who want to see the caves but don't want a long hike. It's also nice for those of us who don't get tickets for other tours well in advance!"
Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Discovery Tour,Sightseeing Tours,4.0,Only option ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a short tour but nice. If you have been in caves before it is a little lacking.

Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Discovery Tour,Sightseeing Tours,4.0,Worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We arrived about 30 minutes before the first tour and bought our tickets. We did have to wait for another guided tour to go before us, but not too inconvenient. We just meandered through the cave at our own pace and the rangers were helpful with questions. The history of the cave was interesting and well presented. The walk down to the cave and the waterfall at the entrance were both very lush and green. Folks with knee issues may have some difficulty with all the inclines and steps. If you go to a gift shop, go to the first one on the right of the entrance as all the profits go to the National parks at that one."
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Step House,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Step House Mesa Verde,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Step House is a nice little add-on if you've already made the drive over for your Long House ticket tour. It is quite the hike up and down in full sun to access it though.  If you're unable to get a Long House ticket, then you won't know what you're missing and will likely enjoy it, but if you just visited Long House and then visit Step House, it might feel unimpressive.  If I didn't have a ticket for Long House, I don't think the drive over to this area of Mesa Verde would be worth it."
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Step House,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,The only dwelling you can visit on your own!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Step House is the smallest of the five main dwellings you can visit at Mesa Verde; it is also the only you can visit on your own. It has two villages from different time periods . It was occupied in the late 500-600s and again in AD 1200s. Thirty to 40 people lived there. It is at the end of the Wetherill Mesa and subsequently, you can only visit the Step House from May through October. It is closed during winter time. If you don't get tickets to see the Long House or the Balcony house, this is the only main dwelling you can visit. The Spruce Tree House and the Cliff Palace are currently closed and you can only see these dwellings from the distance. To arrive to the Step House, you have to drive from the park entrance for approximately 40 minutes to the road junction at Far View and then 35 to 40 minutes to the Wetherill mesa parking; from the parking area you walk to the Step House. The walk is not difficult. In fact, the Pueblo people built a stone stairway that gives the name to the Step House; most dwellings at Mesa Verde are not accessible by a stone stairway. There are kivas and a reconstructed pit house. The alcove is actually impressive! Pictures are really nice. "

Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Step House,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,A remote treasure of the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Step House is one of our favorite dwellings in the park. Our first few trips to Mesa Verde, we never made it to Weathermill Mesa. Big mistake. Step House is a self guided tour that gives you the opportunity to climb around one of the cliff dwellings with no tours or crowds. It was a beautiful hike down and there was a ranger on site to answer questions. The road to Weathermill Mesa has limited hours, so make sure you allow yourself about 45 minutes to an hour to tour Step House. The tram around the rest of the area is a great way to see other ruins and dwellings. And it's free. Try to spot the wild horses roaming the mesa. There is a shelter with a gift shop, info station, and snack shop at the Step House trailhead/tram stop. "
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Step House,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Vastly Underrated Site,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I admit that I saw Step House as an afterthought while waiting for the tram to Long House. My idea was that it could not have been very impressive or they would be charging for guided tours as they do for the other accessible dwellings in the park (apart from Spruce Tree House). Boy, was I wrong! Step House, so named because of the Ancestral Pueblo stairway up to the cliff (which is unique to this site), provides fine examples of all the features one can see on the more restrictive tours, including well-preserved kivas and towers. "
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Step House,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,An appreciation for living under the cliffs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very interesting and free.

Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Step House,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Very interesting with an easy hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This was the one and only cliff dwelling we were able to see when we went into the park.

Paradise,Washington (WA),Myrtle Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Pretty Views,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"You’ll find this one along the Skyline Trail at the Visitors Center. It’s the first one you come to. As far as “easy” I wouldn’t consider it completely so. I’m from a souther state that’s flat with no altitude. The constant .05 mile uphill climb was a bit much. The paved path makes it accessible to anyone. The views are great. The short stairs down at the end are a little rough on older knees, but it’s worth it. You can go a little farther and view the top part from the overlook/bridge. We did not go farther. Going back down the path is on a downward incline. We originally were in the Paradise area around lunch time. Omg the amount of cars there & along the Highway was beyond belief. So after we made the loop we decided to continue on & do other interest the rest of the way & catch it on our way back. Probably 1/4 of the amount of people. Which made the trail nicer. Still a lot of people, but no where near the afternoon massive crowds. We probably would have taken in more trails, but we were heading home the next day & it was getting late. Not enough time."
Paradise,Washington (WA),Myrtle Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Beautiful Falls and Surroundings in Paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Myrtle Falls is located along Skyline Trail in the Paradise area of Mount Rainier National Park and is reached by hiking the trail 0.5 miles (0.8k) starting near the Paradise visitor center.  This portion of Skyline Trail is paved and only rises about 100ft (30.5m) over the half mile to the falls making the falls accessible to most visitors including those in wheelchairs with a little help.  We found the falls to be very pretty, even late in the very dry summer of 2015, and the beauty of the entire area, with the peak and glaciers of Mount Rainier looming overhead, partly shrouded in clouds, made it a rewarding short hike.  The falls can be viewed from both from its base, by following a short but steep spur trail, and its crest from a footbridge along Skyline Trail that crosses the stream just before it plunges over the falls.  We were also able to experience some wildflowers around the falls long after they had faded in the rest of Paradise."

The Trail is completely paved and is suitable for children and elderly.The trail is about two miles bothway and you have a look at a wonderful lake  and scenic mountains at the end of the trail.The only snag is that look out post at the end of the trail is a very small one and gets cramped if more hikers are there. On the whole it is a nice hike with  beautiful scenery on the way.

It is a paved, wheelchair-accessible trail, 1 mile in and 1 mile out, almost entirely shaded until you reach the lake. The lake is very scenic and as nice as many you see higher up in the mountains. You are pretty much limited to a viewing platform (with two benches) at the lake unless you want to bushwhack, but this is not a trail that will attract many bushwhackers. You do need to pay to park at the picnic area ($5 per car, I think), but they also accept the Northwest Recreation Pass and the various National Park Service annual passes."

I never expected to fall in love with the rivers, particularly the Hoh. I took numerous photos, but pictures aren't nearly adequate enough for the astounding slate-blue color, the coldness of the currents, and the utter peace found in the interface of river, forest, sky, and self. If you've never been, go. If you have been, go again. I plan to."

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh River,Bodies of Water,4.5,Nice Glacier-fed River,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Hoh River originates from the Hoh Glacier on the slopes of Mount Olympus and flows about 56 miles (90k) to the west and empties into the Pacific Ocean a little north of Ruby Beach.  While it is popular for fishing during the fall salmon run and it is possible to hike the Hoh River Trail about 18 miles (29k), starting at the National Park visitor center in the Hoh Rain Forest, to the Blue Glacier, the largest glacier on Mount Olympus and which also contributes to the river, the best and most likely way for the average visitor to Olympic National Park to see the Hoh is by hiking the 1.2 mile (1.9k) loop Spruce Nature Trail which also has its trailhead at the same visitor center.  Part of this loop trail runs along the Hoh and I always find glacier-fed rivers pretty and interesting as the cool water with a distinct milkiness from the glacial flour, fine powdered rock created by the erosive forces of the glaciers, flows through a wide, rocky riverbed created as the river snakes and meanders as it deposits silt and rock creating the ever changing course."

We arrived later in the day and had a striking experience. Three black tail deer met us on the House of Moses trail. They were so comfortable, we had to back up to maintain a safe distance.

It is fed by glacier runoff and rain.  On sunny days it looks blue-green, but on cloudy and rainy days it looks milky and grey.  You can see stretches of it from the Hoh road into the rain forest and from the Hoh River trail.  It is a wild and beautiful river, and close views are well worth the hike from the Hoh visitors center."

This was one of the more informative and just in general really neat information and visitor centers that I've been to in a national park and I've been to about 30. The displays that they had here were really awesome and kept the attention of the viewer, I have a really hard time just looking and reading displays, but these made me want to continue looking at them. It was so interesting learning about the history of the park, the history of the trees, and the fossils in the area. There was also in a kids area where they could ""dig"" up fossils. This was probably one of my favorite areas in the whole park, definitely highly recommended area!"

My husband rides bicycle regularly and can do 40 miles at a time and this kicked his butt too.  Could be because of the elevation too.  Me, I do not exercise and it has been awhile since I have hiked.  But we both made it to the top!!!  It just took us a couple hours longer than most, I am sure.  We started at the Glacier Gorge Trailhead at 7:30 a.m. and it took us almost 4-1/2 hours to reach Sky Pond.  By tye time we finished, it had taken almost 8 hours.  "

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sky Pond,Bodies of Water,5.0,Sky Pond...my favorite new hike....,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I hiked to Sky Pond for the first time this mid-June. We had micro spikes and trekking poles for the hike knowing there was snow on the ground from the Loch on. There will be snow on the Sky Pond trail until mid-July this year say the park rangers due to the amount of snow that fell in May. So, wear the micro spikes and use the trekking poles to make the hike more manageable. Beautiful hike with views of The Loch, Timberline Falls, Lake of Glass and Sky Pond. 9 to 10 mile hike depending on where you start. You want to start at Glacier Gorge trailhead but the lot was full for us and not shuttle until later in June so we started at Bear Lake which adds one mile for the roundtrip (10 miles). Timberline Falls when free of snow has to be climbed with both hands and feet grabbing for holding. Class 2 climb 100 foot with no equipment necessary but one needs to be careful of the water and slipping. We had all snow to climb and it was very steep. Going up was tricky and coming down was a controlled slide being careful not to fall into rocks below,. Sky Pond is a little tough to find from Lake of Glass since there is no trail but keep the to the right of Lake of Glass and you will run into Sky Pond and the Sharkstooth which is .4 miles from Lake of Glass (which sits above Timberline Falls). About a 1,700 elevation gain and trail is rated as strenuous 12.60.  Plan on starting early to get off the top before the afternoon storms roll in. It took us 6 hrs in the snow and we stayed a while at the Loch and Sky Pond to enjoy the views. Not child friendly."

It's not as bad as it looks, and it's totally worth the effort.  A beautiful, amazing place.  Actually there are about 5 amazing places on this hike.  If you want to see more, you can come back via the Dream Lake side of the trail, but that will bump it up to 11.2 miles, and the other lakes are a bit anti-climactic after you've seen The Loc and Sky Pond.

There are pull-outs where you can stop and walk right up to some giants--living and dead.  Great photo ops--one tree we lined up 6 people (some were kids)  with arms outstretched and still did not reach across the front of the tree.  Another spot you get to climb into a big burned out area of a still living tree.  At the end of the road is the tunnel log--you get to drive through a fallen sequoia (our Suburban fit through easily, unlike a later stop up north at the Shine Drive Through Tree where it wouldn't fit and we had to back out of the drive) and stop and take pictures.  Everyone was great about taking turns in the log and with pictures too.  Really loved it."

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Dickey Ridge Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Slow and steady up.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great trail to try when you're not looking for the most strenuous climb in the park. It's a steady climb from the bottom to the top which gives you the elevation without the huffing and puffing.  There's a short (Fox Farm) loop near the top that goes by an old cemetery, and a visitor's center at the top where you can buy an ice cream or have your lunch while looking over the Shenandoah Valley.  You can have the short version of 6 miles or extend it another four miles or so by continuing south in a loop.  You park by the side of the road shortly before the entrance station."

Ask a park ranger where it is on the map before leaving the Dickey Ridge Visitor Center because it's not marked on the map.   You can get a map at the visitor center or download one off the internet.   I added a photo of it to this review, but it might be hard to view it.  "

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Dickey Ridge Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Took us about 90 minutes of brisk hiking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the Dickey Ridge Trail from the Visitor center and then merged onto the Snead Farm trail. This is the better way to make the loop. Dickey Ridge is a little rocky and has quite a bit of elevation change, moderately challenging. When it meets up with the Snead Farm trail it levels out and eventually joins a gravel fire road which is easy walking back. With little kids you could easily do the Snead Farm trail as an out and back. "

The trailhead is right across Skyline Drive from the visitor center. This is a self-guided interpretive hike with brochures available at the visitor center or at the trailhead if you'd like to learn a little more about the history and nature of the area. Right at the trailhead, there is an open wildflower meadow and then the trail heads into the woods. Along the way, you'll see some signs of the area's past, including large rock piles, the remains of a homestead, and the Fox cemetery. A few of the graves here are for soldiers from the Civil War. The trail then loops around back to the trailhead. It's a nice easy hike for people who want to get out and see some of the park without a more strenuous adventure."

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Limberlost Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great Hike for an Easy Stroll and for Baby Strollers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is probably the easiest trail within the park.  It is an accessible trail that allows visitors in wheelchairs or transport chairs to enjoy the mountain forest.  If you have infants or young children you can hike the trail while they ride in their stroller.  There are many wooden benches placed along the trail to sit and rest while taking in the serenity of the forest.  This 1.3 mile loop trail is well signed and because of its packed crushed stone surface there should be no problem following the trail.  One geological item of interest along the trail is a rock formation known as the ""Rock of Ages"".  This is an example of columnar jointing and demonstrates how ancient lava jutted up from within the earth.  The ""Rock of Ages""  is approximately mid-way along the trail.  The Limberlost parking area (which is signed on Skyline Drive) is located at milepost 43.  This is just a little south of the Skyland Lodge complex."

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cruz Bay Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.0,Hours are very limited,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"They close at 3 every day so if you are on the beach and aren't staying in Cruz bay you have to be sure to leave early to get there. They are not open on the weekends. They are not extremely motivated either so begin their close routine early so don't show up at 2:45 or you won't get any real help either. They don't print many items out to save paper, which is fine, but also don't post them online, to save ?? not sure what. So they have a schedule of things going on at Annandale estate but your only option is to memorize it or try to take a picture through glass on your cell phone which really doesn't work. I did see one ranger out of the office once, on easter sunday. he was giving a tickets to people parked at maho beach who were parked where people always park??"

It was actually the cheapest excursion we could take and we wanted to do something relaxing and enjoyable.  We are both in our early 50's, but young at heart and sports. This is a trip we took without our kids.  First, a wonderful boat ride from St. Thomas to St. John ensued.  Once we got to St. John, the crew was quick to get us onto Tour buses and we enjoyed an incredible tour through St. John National Park.  The views were incredible and our tour guide was fun!  He took time to let us take photographs as we stopped.  I would actually do this tour again and go to St. John AGAIN.  It was absolutely worth every minute!"

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cruz Bay Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.0,Spectacular,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Took an excursion off a Holland America cruise and we agreed this was our best excursion of the trip. Great narrated boat ride from St Thomas to St John on the Island Girl, where we got an informative bus tour of the National Park. One stunningly beautiful beach after another, facts about geography, flora and fauna. Real estate prices ($$$$$$$). Lots of photo ops. Steep, steep roads and lots of hairpin turns. We learned they drive on the left, even though the cars are left drive: less likelihood of going off a cliff that way. Visitors Center is housed in a handsome old building right on the dock, ventilated by a large arched opening that can be closed with giant shutters. Informative dioramas and photographs, very nice collection of T shirts and souvenirs, particularly for kids. Only downer was unfriendly cashiers. Smile when you take our money! Very clean bathrooms reeking of scouring powder. Great visit."

We were on a self guided tour of St. John's and the Virgin Islands National Park around Trunk Bay, The Cruz Bay Visitor Center is situated in the very quaint, picturesque sheltered waterfront of this gateway to the Virgin Island National Park. The information at the center is very helpful and historically interesting to browse through. The staff and wardens are very friendly and informative and will genuinely be interested in giving you pertinent information to make your visit to St. John a truly extraordinary, natural world experience. The staff will enthusiastically encourage you to get the most out of your visit within your time constraints and will channel you to the highlights of this fantastically gorgeous scenic natural Caribbean environment that is preserved within the Virgin Island National Park. This Cruz Bay Visitor Center is a must stop right after you disembark on your journey from St. Thomas, so you can get a good feel and idea of the history, culture and natural world environments on this amazingly beautiful island. The info center is right on the dockside shoreline near colorful shops, bars and eateries around Mongoose Junction in the good feel, safe feeling waterfront environment of Cruz Bay. The visitor center is a very modern looking , red roofed structure with suttle light biege walls with green painted panels that seem to match the earthy tones of this environment. It is situated on the water amid various boats moored to the docks and near the leafy palm studded walkways and kids park within a few paces. The center has historical displays, artifacts, items for sale and valuable information on the bio-diversity of the natural world of this unique ecosystem and its inhabitants.It is a very clean and inviting place and source of educational, environmental,and biological information on the various habitats encountered in the Virgin Island National Park in and around Cruz Bay and St. John. The bay around the Cruz Bay Visitor Center is stunning with colorful sailboats bobbing on the tourquoise waters beside steep rocky shores where seabirds soar on the warm thermal updrafts against azure blue skies strewn with fluffy white clouds.This picturesque location has got to be the closest thing to heaven and makes your inner soul feel at peace with the natural world and makes you yearn to return again. The Cruz Bay Visitor Center is an impressive way to start your adventure to give you information to inform you of the things to see and do on this awe-inspiring, spine-tingling beautiful piece of paradise on a majestic.preserved Caribbean island with low-key commercialism and impact. The quaintness and closeness of everything around the visitor center is very peaceful and warm hearted with a very small town feel of friendly helpful people proud to provide you with material to enjoy your visit to their paradise.I highly recommend visiting the visitor center for a few minutes or more to get orientation for a memorable journey to St, John as you will definately want to return someday and enjoy the hospitality of the visitor center and it's amazing island environs as they will inform you and give you valuable information."

You will pass by some ruins, enjoy some shade on the trail and maybe even run into a donkey or deer as we have. It's a gentle walk, well groomed and not too rocky. You can walk with your cooler, snorkel bag, etc. without much issue. If you are with people who prefer not to hike, or if you have a lot of gear, drop a member of your crew at the beach, drive back the 0.2miles to the trail parking and enjoy the quiet walk yourself before having a great time at the beach."

When I was there with my family, we could see large, green turtles poking their heads above the water. We also snorkeled with them. This area is very secluded and is very beautiful. There are definitely bugs, so bring repellent. If you hike the full trail, you will also get to the bench. This area is great and genuinely my favorite beach on St. John and I loved seeing turtles, frigatebirds, and pelicans. Highly recommended."

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Francis Bay Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Nice Trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We hiked this short trail after visiting Francis bay.  The bay is more protected than the rest of the North shore so it can be better snorkeling if the water is choppy elsewhere.  The trail passes the remains of a nice historic building and also passes a salt pond where you can bird watch.  It ends back at the road at which point you can walk back to the parking area or turn around and take the trail back the way you came.

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Francis Bay Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Best nature trail on the island,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are into wildlife and birds, this is the best place on the island.  The trail is flat and easy to walk around once or twice in a visit.  Lots of birds on the pond visible from either platform or from the trail on the east side of the lake.

The beach is your reward, with plenty of tropical fish, rays and some turtles that can be seen.  Additionally, it's a favorite for pelicans who like to feed in this bay. "

It has signs throughout to tell about the ruins and the nature.  The ruins are cool to explore.  However, i probably wouldn’t spend the time to walk the trail if hiking is your purpose.  There are much better and interesting trails.  But stopping to see the ruins is worth it! Or if you have small children, this is an easy one for them."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail,Historic Sites,4.5,Take the steep trail on the left,4.0 of 5 bubbles,The longer trail on the left that goes up to the ruins is a good hike. Several switchbacks and a decent elevation gain. Mostly shaded canopy but you'll still need adequate water and a little insect repellent around your ankles. Long pants not needed on this trail like on Lind Point Trail. 
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail,Historic Sites,4.5,A pleasant challenge,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We’re over 60, not athletic, so this met my criteria for a modest challenge. After the boardwalk ran out, we continued uphill on the trail, past the next sign. The roots, rocks and modest hills were manageable with my borrowed trekking poles (well worth it to me to check a piece of luggage in order to bring them with a weak ankle!). You cross the gut (gully) and come back down on the other side of the ruins. From there, you are able to rejoin the boardwalk. The ruins, cemetery, and bay rum leaves were made more interesting by the posted signs. We parked in the Cinnamon Bay parking lot in the afternoon. That seemed to work out well."

The National Park has created a boardwalk style elevated trail in the ruins area. The trail loops to a quarter mile path surrounding the old mill. There is signage which helps the visitor identify components of the site. be careful when the boardwalk is damp because it can be a little slippery. Just hold the rails! If a visitor were to close their eyes and imagine the sugar mill in operation during its heyday, history of the area will come alive. There is no charge to vist the Bay or the historical area nearby."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail,Historic Sites,4.5,NOT Cinnamon Bay Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Cinnamon Bay Trail is mile long, strenuous hike to Centerline Road.  This is a self-guiding NATURE trail across the road from Cinnamon Bay Campground. The 1/2 mile loop passes through the ruins of an old sugar factory and native tropical trees. It's listed as ""easy"" but I wouldn't call it that. It's very rocky terrain and gets a little steep.  Fairly easy to follow, just go from sign to sign.  I was surprised to find the crypts of a Danish family who perished on the island.  Excellent trail and very educational."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail,Historic Sites,4.5,How many hikes include burial crypts?,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We only had time for one hike and this was perfect.  The ruins of the sugar cane factory were so interesting, and when we saw the crypts, well, that was a first on any hike we have ever taken.  The loop took us maybe 45 minutes tops, some of us in flip flops.  As a bonus, we saw two mongoose crossing the road on our way out."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail,Historic Sites,4.5,Good Place to Explore,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"As with the Annaberg Ruins just up the road, the Cinnamon Bay Nature Trails is a nice change of pace from the beaches. I appreciated the plaques set up to explain what purposes the buildings once had and it made it easier to imagine what it would have once looked like (there's even a small graveyard there). We didn't have time to explore then entire trail so I will most likely make a point to go back on our next visit (because you don't visit a place like St. John just once!)."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail,Historic Sites,4.5,Gorgeous Steep Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Gorgeous steep hike from North Shore Road up to Centerline Road. The hurricanes have killed many trees and diminished the foliage on the island. This means that the views are more open and spectacular than ever before. Make sure and take the side trail to the old sugar planation ruins. There is an awe-inspiring view to Maho Beach and the BVI behind the ruins. Take lots of water.
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail,Historic Sites,4.5,A Wonderful Walk!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Across from the parking area at Cinnamon Bay is a boardwalk through the woods to the Cinnamon Bay Plantation. The signs provide an easy self-guided tour trough the sugar mills and furnaces. From the boardwalk, down some stairs, brings one to the Loop Trail: a delightful walk into the forest with helpful signs which identify many of the trees and other attractions. Although others have cautioned about mosquitoes, we did not experience them here."

McCarthy,Alaska (AK),Copper Spike Transport,Taxis & Shuttles,4.5,Great trip to Wrangell National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I considered all options on how to get to McCarthy in Wrangell National Park as part of our quest to hit a bunch of national parks.  We were absolutely pleased with our choice of Copper Spike Transport.  Jamie picked us up promptly at our AIRBNB in Anchorage.  The 8-9 drive to McCarthy was beautiful.  Along the way Jamie shared lots of stories about the area and stopped at various scenic viewpoints.  For lunch we stopped at a local family restaurant.  The food was delicious.  We stayed for 2 nights and the return trip was just as enjoyable.  Thank you Jamie!

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Grand Loop Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,We Toured it One and a Half Times...Almost,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were not told of a road closure before traveling 16 miles toward our campground. We had to turn around and travel 16 miles back, almost to where we entered the park, and then take the opposite direction to the one planned. It would have been extremely helpful if the ranger at the gate had told us of the road closure when handing us the map. We subsequently were unable to complete the loop in the opposite direction the following day because another section of road was closed. Fortunately, the signs for that closure came before we had to take a significant detour. The grand loop for us was a great overview, but we couldn't get back to the mud geysers we had passed only the day before."

No worries though as there is so much to see. Really liked the SE portion of the loop where a vast majority of geysers are located. "
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Grand Loop Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Do It - You’ll Love It,5.0 of 5 bubbles,During our five days in Yellowstone NP we saw just about every interest available.  The 140 miles Grand Loop Drive was done on the third day after visiting some of the shorter scenic drives.   The diversity of the drive is amazing and gives you a great idea of the wonders of the park and animals that inhabit it.  I got a few clean shots of some of the locals residents.   Well worth the drive.
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Grand Loop Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Great place to see Bison,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great place to see bison and wildlife, but be prepared for a long traffic backup when animals are in the area. Bison will cross the road and all traffic must stop for them. Other wildlife in the area too. Remember when you visit Yellowstone National Park, whether in a car, truck or walking, the animals have the right  of way!"

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Grand Loop Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Well maintained road to enjoy the best sights in Yellowstone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well maintained road, well marked and plenty of places to pull over and enjoy the views.  If you see a bunch of cars pulled over that means there is wildlife close by.  We saw a wolf stalking a mountain once.  Other times it has been a single or herd of bison crossing the road.  One early morning we encountered three grizzlies.  The road brings you to all the great places to visit in the park.  Be patient and enjoy the views."

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Bridalveil Fall,National Parks,4.5,Bridalveil Falls was roaring and loud!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a stunning waterfall that is a must see and do on your bucket list.  We recently traveled to Yosemite national park and wanted to see all the waterfalls throughout the park.  California had a very rainy and snowy winter, above average, so going there in early June was the perfect time to see Bridalveil Falls.  The snow was melting at such a high clip, that the water flow was massive and roaring with no stopping insight.  We got excelling videos and pictures.  The waterfalls look like a bridal veil, thus the name."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Bridalveil Fall,National Parks,4.5,"Beautiful, but beware the smoke",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As of our visit on September 13th, the water is flowing and you can still hike up to the base of the falls.  There's some restoration work going on in the area, but it didn't hamper us at all.  The main deterrent right now is the smoke, which is off and on going from a little foggy to nightfall at noon.  "
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Bridalveil Fall,National Parks,4.5,Misty Bridal Veil is best in June,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bridal Veil is best in June.  Bring a plastic bag to wear.  The mist will soak you.  And wear sturdy non-slip shoes as the rocks are wet.  Sadly, some people don't feel they have to pick up their trash.  Be a good do bee and bring a trash bag to pick up litter.  Not enough rangers to do that efficiently on the trails.  I have my kids do the same when we hike anywhere.  We do it on our way back unless we see a pile of trash.  Then we stop and pick it up.  People on tour buses are the worst.  I think they view our National parks like Disneyland where there are people to pick up after you.  I guess they are right because my family picks up their trash.  Maybe the tour opporators should say something to the tourists with them."

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Bridalveil Fall,National Parks,4.5,Beautiful Waterfall !,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A beautiful waterfall! Catch it in the right light and it can look like a firefall. It is a short and easy hike to the viewing area. The fall is very beautiful and you will probably get hit with the spray and mist of it. This is especially nice on a hot day. Beware: don’t go beyond the railings. Many have been injured and a couple even killed climbing over the rocks( wet polished granite with moss). It is perfectly safe and enjoyable from the viewing area. Unfortunately this year (2020) the parking lot and trail are closed. The fall can be seen from the road or at other points in the valley.

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Sentinel Dome,Geologic Formations,5.0,THE view at Yosemite!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the place to come for views if you only have limited time or are unable to undertake some of the more strenuous hikes. The short and fairly easy hike to the dome is followed by a marginally steep but also short hike up the dome itself, upon the summit of which truly glorious views of the region can be found in all directions - Half Dome, El Capitan and all the rest. This is a superior view to that from Glacier Point other than being somewhat further away from Nevada Falls."

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Sentinel Dome,Geologic Formations,5.0,Spectacular Sentinel Dome,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Our second favorite hike at Yosemite (Nevada Falls Loops was #1).  The main portion of the hike is short and fairly easy.  It's the last portion when you have to climb the dome to the top that is really tough.  It is extremely steep and challenging to climb, but the payoff is immense.  This hike isn't as crowded as some of the rest, and some people stop halfway up the dome and don't make it.  We left early for this hike and were able to enjoy the top of the dome for 15 minutes before anyone else made it up..and the views were just spectacular.  My key tip:  don't give up half way up the dome like many...take your time and pace yourself...you won't regret it."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Sentinel Dome,Geologic Formations,5.0,Greats views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views from Sentinel dome are breathtaking.

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Sentinel Dome,Geologic Formations,5.0,Amazing views with relatively short hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't miss this hike!  It's pretty short but the pay off is amazing.  It took us about 30 minutes or so to get to the top where there is a panoramic view.

You get to such wonderfull Vista point with relatively short trail which is fairly easy. The view is astonishing, you can see the entire valley with it magnificent rock formation.

Once you are up there..."

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Sentinel Dome,Geologic Formations,5.0,"Road closed, view dome from afar",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since Glacier Point Road is closed this year, it’s not really feasible to enjoy the short hike up to the top of Sentinel Dome.  So this year we just viewed Sentinel Dome from North Dome across the Valley.  It is a very different perspective to look at Sentinel Dome rather than being on Sentinel Dome."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Tioga Pass,Scenic Drives,5.0,Take an Extra 20 mile down out of the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a GREAT drive, with beautiful view of mountains, valleys, and Half Dome.  If taking the road from the west, it starts off slow but gets better as you head towards the Tioga Pass. Once you reach the pass, you need to continue out of the park for about another 20 miles to the town of Lee Vining, through  Inyo National Forest.  This drive was about 20 miles, dropping from an elevation of 9,945 feet to 6,837 feet.  It was INCREDIBLE!!!!  The town was nothing.  We thought we would stop for some Ice cream, but could not find anything from a convivence store.  But you will LOVE the drive, almost straight down, with the view of mountains, lakes  and the valley.  Don't miss it!"
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Tioga Pass,Scenic Drives,5.0,Scenic but very scary. Would not do it again,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Oh this pass is scary. Great view but there is a point (direction yosemite to Lee Vining)  where you are just about hanging on the cliff, driving to the edge no barriers no protection no anything. We were driving also with an RV which made it worse. You are at a point looking ahead and you observe the road going abruptly down on the other side of the mountain thinking omg are you going to be there too and oh yes you are."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Tioga Pass,Scenic Drives,5.0,Grand Sights,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The east entrance to the park is the lesser-used entrance and a beautiful drive through mountains, meadows, and valleys.  We were fortunate enough to get a day pass, but the line was still very long because it was filled with people that did not realize they needed a pass.  Once in the park, we sat for a long time in a construction pilot car line.  The parking lots in the valley were all full or closed.  The park has become a very difficult place to maneuver/enjoy.  The sights are spectacular, but the time spent getting from one place to another detracts greatly from the experience."

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Tioga Pass,Scenic Drives,5.0,Don’t miss this drive if the rod is open!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful drive that shouldn’t be missed when the road is open. I love that it wasnt’t crowded in mid august. Granite formation you see along the drive, the lakes, the snow capped peaks was incredibly scenic! I prefer Tioga pass than  the valley floor honestly. From Lee Vining to the valley floor we made 4 stops & ended up to be an 8 hour ordeal. Take your time & just take it all in. You won’t regret it. Tip: if you’re short on time skip Tuolumne grove. The hike back is strenuous 1 mile."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Tioga Pass,Scenic Drives,5.0,Bold scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Man this drive was stunning. This drive is actually better than the actual park itself. The rock formations,(Olmstead pt) the 2 lakes you see (tenaya and tioga lake , the  Tuolumne meadows, and I hiked up lembert dome, these are the 4th spectacular stops you must see, the tioga lake is last. This is on the eastern part of park. I was coming from San Francisco so got there around 1pmand got out of there by dusk. If you have 2 days in yosemite, make this part of it. The valley is beautiful but of course only the lower waterfalls was flowing so that might be my opinion. I think tioga is more breathtaking. I had 2 days in yosemite and once again spent one of them here. This was early October 2022"

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mist Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Should be top Yosemite hike on everyone's list,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Worth every minute of the climb! The first mile or so is bland upward climbing but soon enough the falls come into view and everything becomes so immersive that you forget about the continual stairs (and there are indeed large parts of actual stairs here). Even during this summer of extremely low water levels and an essentially completely dry Yosemite Falls by late July, both Vernal and Nevada Falls were incredibly beautiful."

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mist Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Highlight of our California ( SF-Monterey-Yosemite) fortnight - WOW!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Probably the best hike we’ve ever done as a family, we walked to Vernal Falls first and then on up Nevada Falls and back. C.7 miles, c3,500 total climb, c.4 hours walking but c.7 hours total with all the WOW view stops and a proper break at the top of Nevada Falls before following the John Muir trail back down (a little longer but less busy and not just retreading the steps you take up)"
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mist Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Drenched, and loved it!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After a heavy winter snow, the run off of water was exceptional.  The trail can take some time and finish and it is always up hill with a lot of steps!  The views are worth it though! Absolutely bring a waterproof jacket, pack etc.  My trip past Vernal falls was so full of spray the falls were almost unseeble, some choosing to actally turn back ( though I doubt it's normally this bad)  since the trail was with in the heavy spray. It is really worth the trip, and plan to spend some time at the top of Nevada falls where you can sit down for a picnic!  The views are great as you look down the valley past the ""silver apron"" and ""Emerald pools"".  "
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mist Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Steep But Worth It,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had already done quite a bit of walking/hiking before we started up this trail (from the parking lot to Lower Yosemite Falls, then to Mirror Lake, then to the trailhead for this hike)  since the shuttle buses are not operating this Summer.  For that reason, I only walked up the the Vernal Falls footbridge - my wife did continue a bit further to the bottom of the stairs going up to the top of Vernal Falls.  Even up to the footbridge, the trail, while wide and paved, is still quite steep and also pretty crowded.  If we had been able to ride the shuttles to some of the trailheads I would have liked to go further up on this trail, but by the end of the day I had put over 14 miles in, so I was glad I decided to stop here.  It was still quite a beautiful hike, and one everyone who is capable of should try and do."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mist Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Not for kids,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an amazing trail that leads to Vernal and Nevada Falls. It is not for kids though! We saw so many young kids or people hiking with flip flops on, I hope they weren't going past the steps to Vernal Falls. It is not too bad of a hike to the bottom of Vernal and you can get a great view! But once the stairs get wet, and the trail gets crowded, it can be very tricky. More people die on this trail than any other part of Yosemite. We turned around once the handrail for the stairs ended, it was too crowded and slippery to go any further without something to hold on to. Still got some amazing pictures!"
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mist Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Wonderful Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Considered  a moderately strenuous hike covering slightly over 1000 feet in elevation change. The Mist trail is 0.8 miles to the footbridge (so 1-1/2 miles round trip) OR, 1.2 miles approx to the top of Vernal Falls(2.4 miles round trip) . Good ops of Vernal Falls from the footbridge. Also of note is that there is water available just past the footbridge to fill up water bottle. The second half of the hike from footbridge to the falls is considerably more uphill, but my wife and I in our mid 60's got to the base of Vernal Falls. Allow for 2 to 3 hours depending on length of hike and ability.  Recommendation is to hike in the morning during the summer months!"

The walk to Vernal Falls bridge is easy, to the top of Vernal Falls moderate but WORTH IT, and extended to the bridge that gives you a great view of Nevada Falls.

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Vernal Fall,Waterfalls,4.5,Premier Hike Expereience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are adventurous , this hike is well worth it. The trail to Vernal falls is 1-1/2 miles round trip to footbridge( or about 2-1/2 miles roundtrip to top of falls)   and considered to be ""moderately strenuous"". My wife and I were 64 and 63 years old when we did the hike in mid July of 2021. Note of caution however, is it can be really hot in July on that trail....so.  instead of going in the afternoon, we opted for the next morning when it was considerably cooler , which was smart. Trail covers a little over 1000 feet in elevation and is mostly uphill with a few downhill stretches. A little over halfway to the falls proper, you come to the footbridge (0.8 miles in) , from whence you can see the falls in the distance, offering good photo ops. The reminder of the trail from the bridge to the falls is more uphill, and one should consider going on or not, depending on health, water, etc.. There is water available just past the bridge to refill bottles. My wife and I did do the second stretch to just beneath the falls, However, we did NOT do the additional distance from beneath the falls to the top of the falls- But a friend of ours had done it and thought it worth while, but being in our 60's and somewhat tired, we decided to turn around and head back. Overall the hike was roughly 3 hours for my wife and I due to the additional walking from the first parking area (not the second smaller trail head lot) to the Mist Trail trail head. My wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly and certainly recommend the hike! PS Falls are 317 feet in height with impressive different colored granite as backdrop!"
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Vernal Fall,Waterfalls,4.5,Starts moderate then gets strenuous ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail starts moderate but gets tougher with steep unsteady path and steps.

While it was definitely A HIKE (all up hill), it took just a few hours to go up to the falls and back down. Plenty of spots to rest, catch your breath, and take in the beautiful scenery! Pack your water bottle, don't worry there is a restroom half way up. The falls are gorgeous and if you're lucky, you'll catch a rainbow through the mists! Wear good hiking shoes, the stairs by the falls are steep, wet, and slippery! "

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Vernal Fall,Waterfalls,4.5,Simply stunning and breathtaking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Best hike of my life!! No words to describe how beautiful the trail and the falls are. 1) It’s nearly 4 miles roundrip if you stay on the mist trail (not 2.5 or 3 miles as some claim). 2) It’s 6.1 miles if you go up the mist trail and down the John Muir trail. 3) There is a TON of water in the summer, not sure what these other reviewer‘s were seeing or not seeing. 4) The stairs make it very strenuous. Be realistic about your abilities rather than and give les stars because of your physical condition. 5) If you’re not physically fit, go to the foot bridge and back.

There is a shuttle service to the trailhead which is very necessary (without the shuttle you would have to take a very steep 2 mile hike just to get to the trailhead). There are various hikes you can take and obviously the shorter routes are much busier. Have an idea prior to your trip on what you want to see to better determine the route you want to take. Our family went further than a majority of the crowds and made our way to the Telescope Tree (very cool to actually go inside a Sequoia!). Our ""custom"" hike was just under 6 miles. Take breaks and plenty of water especially on a warm day!"
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,Parks,4.5,"Great views of the sequias, but take the long hike!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved our visit to the mariposa grove.  Outside of Muir Woods in CA, this was our first visit to a large grove and it was really breathtaking.  Most folks on tours or visiting only go on the shorter trail. Take the long trail and see the trees around the upper grove.  We would have hiked more, but missed a few shortcuts we could have taken on perimeter trails They could use some better maps to show how the short cuts will save you time, especially for folks that dont want longer hikes.  Fantastic views for us with fantastic weather!"
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,Parks,4.5,one of the best experiences of my life.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"i am so very glad we got to experience this. my wife and I took our oldest here for her graduation present and it was such a great experience.  we came july 2020 during the coronavirus upheaval and couldn't get a day entry pass so we took the YARTS bus into the park and it dropped us of right at the grove parking lot, which is literally right next to the park entrance. we got there as early as the YARTS bus could get us there, so we arrived at the mariposa grove parking area/bus stop at 830am. since they aren't running the park shuttles we walked the trail from the parking area to the grove.  there was barely anyone else around, only maybe 10-20 cars in the parking lot.  we are very active people so the hike to the grove on the trail wasn't difficult and took us about 45 minutes to cover the 2 miles. once we got to the grove (I want you to listen carefully to me here), it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.  there was basically no one there.  i counted 11 other people  the entire time we were walking around the grove. it felt like we had it to ourselves and i felt so honored to have gotten that experience.  i have never had that feeling in nature before.  the trees are absolute giants and it was so cool to see them.  we sat for 15 minutes on the benches at/under the grizzly giant and just absorbed how large and awesome it is and didn't see another person the whole time we sat there.     we walked the rest of the Grizzly Giant Loop Trail and it was just as excellent as anyone could ever ask for.  we didn't rush ourselves and we spent a comfortable amount of time in the grove and enjoyed ourselves there.  we made it back to the grove parking area to catch the YARTS bus back out of the parking area about 1230 or so.  since we didn't know how long it would take us to get to the grove, we were hiking with a good bit of hustle, but were able to take our time in the grove and on the hike back to the parking area.  awesome experience, highly recommend.  if you decided to take the trail from the parking area to the grove, your shoes and lower legs are going to be absolutely covered in dust.  my wife and daughter used the time before the bus came one we got back to the parking area to wash their legs.  being the caveman that i am i chose to just stew in my grime."

No family should need to walk 6 miles to see these trees. I saw toddlers, little dogs and the elderly all on their near death hike to the trees during the heatwave. Many never made it. What a National Park Service (NPS) mistake this is! The Rangers are set up on wrong side of the visitor center. The public unknowingly walks to the trailhead without NPS input. You'd think someone is charge would step up. The Shuttles are not running. The New Visitor Center is now 2 miles away from the old Center so everyone with outdated guide books is ill prepared. Plan to see sequoias elsewhere."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,Parks,4.5,Mariposa Grove - Yosemite,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Since they have renovated and upgraded the area it's quite a place to visit! I visited in June and the grove is located  1hr south of Yosemite valley on hwy 41. After parking in a fairly large lot, you can either go to the store or jump on one of the buses that will drive  ( at no cost, since it's still in Yosemite) you to Mariposa Grove.  Once there you can wander at your own speed and take the various wide circuitous paths around the area. The trees are magnificent and are truly big! Some of their branches as bid as a normal tree!  If you want to see big Sequoias without the crowds this is the park in my opinion.  Buses were full but available."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,Parks,4.5,Post Washburn Fire visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We shuttled up early in the morning to avoid the heat of the day.  The Mariposa Grove shuttle driver clearly explained where to get off the shuttle and where to get back on.  I noticed that the line to get back on the shuttle to head down has been updated with ropes to keep folks organized; when we visited in June, getting on the shuttle was just a pushy free-for-all. The return ride was about a 30 minute wait to board a shuttle.  Midweek, late Sept."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,Parks,4.5,Not worth the hike,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you have ever seen a giant sequoia anywhere else-Muir Woods, N Coast, Kings Canyon, you can skip Mariposa Grove. I love to hike and I love trees, but this was so disappointing. 2 mile hike uphill through manzanita that was very exposed and hot then you get to the ""grove"" and there are very few trees! I was expecting a beautiful, lush, cooling hike and grove. Nope. Unfortunately fire damage and managed thinning has reduced this grove to a few trees. I would not recommend. There is no shuttle right now. Maybe if the shuttle is running it would be worth a quick look. "
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,Parks,4.5,Giant Trees,4.0 of 5 bubbles,If you haven’t seen sequoias before it is about 30 miles from the west entry of El Portal side. There is a shuttle that runs during the summer. During the winter it is about an extra 4 mile round trip to get to the shuttle drop off up a hill or through the trail in the woods. There are some really large sequoias there like Grizzly Bear and the walk through tree.
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,Parks,4.5,Beautiful area of Yosemite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an amazing way to spend a couple hours. This is right near the south entrance of the park. This section of the park had only been opened a couple days when we visited so the shuttles were not running. We left the parking lot about 9 and walked up the road. It took 50 minutes. Once we got up there it was REALLY snowy. The snow was pretty packed but we did slip and slide a little bit. For sake of time, we only hiked out to the tunnel tree (0.7) and then came back the same way. There are much longer hikes you can do if you want. It was a beautiful area of the park. Make sure you pack snacks and water and go to the bathroom before you go up. I would suggest doing this as early as possible to avoid large crowds. Great way to spend 3+ hours."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias,Parks,4.5,"This walk will get your heart pumping, but well worth it.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is Yosemite, not Disneyland. So it’s nature at its best. This is hundreds of years of history in the making, it was never designed for humans to have an easy time seeing it. Having said that it has certainly been assisted in modern times to let us visit it. To give a balanced review we took the trail up from the main car park. $35 to enter Yosemite, but that lasts for 7 days. The walk up does have some fallen trees on it, of which most you walk around. If not, sit on it and slide over. It’s a steep walk and takes over an hour. Yes, it’s 2 miles. At that point you reach the car park, or if you had the appropriate badge, that’s where you park. Toilets were open and operational. Fallen Monarch road with easy access at this point is closed as there was damage to it. However easy access road to the left all the way to Bachelor and Three sisters is open, though to be honest if you are pushing a wheelchair it isn’t going to be easy. From here we walked the trail to Grizzly Giant and California Tunnel Tree. Total time at this point for a man of 60 years from entrance to Tunnel Tree took exactly one and a half hours. That was what I wanted to see so I can’t comment on anything else beyond. Return walk was down the road and was smoother but felt longer. No speeding traffic came past, just plenty of happy hikers with pleasant “Good mornings.” Total time to Tunnel Tree and back was 3 hours. Total distance 6.2 miles. Plenty of toilets available at various intervals, road or trail. If you are inspired by natures wonders well worth the effort. If you are looking for Disneyland and staff at every corner you are visiting the wrong location. Put simply, sorry to say but not everyone will be able to visit and enjoy it. For those that can, do. Another attraction nearby is the swinging bridge which is a lot easier to drive and walk to, which we did later, so consider that if you don’t want this strenuous hike."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),El Capitan,Geologic Formations,5.0,Surreal Gigantic Wall of Granite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"On our way out of the valley to our lodge, our last stop was at El Capitan.  We parked in the small lot next to the road and walked the short hike to the two trails that climbers use, leading up to the base of this gigantic wall of granite.  My wife walked up one of them and got right up to the face of the cliff, putting her hands on the wall, and also talked to a young man who was preparing to do some climbing on this Mecca for rock climbers.  I was pretty beat and my knees were complaining after over 14 miles of walking and hiking so I contented myself with craning my neck to look up the 3000+ feet to the top and scanning the wall with my binoculars.  I was lucky enough to catch a brief glimpse of a climber rappelling down the cliff face.  Photos and words cannot really convey the scale of this giant rock - seeing it in person is almost a surreal experience."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),El Capitan,Geologic Formations,5.0,One of the most well-known areas of the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of the most iconic views of any of the national parks and one of Yosemite's most unique features. Viewing this from anywhere in the park provides a different experience especially when the sunlight hits it at different parts of the day. A good way to view it, along with the entire valley, is from Tunnel View which can add much more dramatic features and textures as the shadows start to set in!"
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),El Capitan,Geologic Formations,5.0,Looming Like a Rock Wave,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When a rock has a name you know it is impressive.  I have only seen El Cap from the valley floor but the words to describe it fall short.  We saw it from several places but the best may be from the meadow along the valley road.  Here our group marveled at climbers you could actually see ascending as well as the hanging tents they use for sleep.  At 3,000 vertical feet of rock, there is really nothing else that compares to it.  In additional you will feel it as its shape is like a building wave that looms over you.  It is a highlight and you should stop and see it from as many places as you can."

We started at the valley floor and made it up the cables.  It can be done in a day, but it’s a serious hike.  Need to start before the sun comes up and be prepared for most of the day.  Take plenty of water and snacks.  Gloves and harnesses are recommended to go up the cables."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Half Dome,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Iconic hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Half Dome is the symbol of Yosemite and perhaps the most recognizable feature in the park. You will see it from everywhere in the main valley. The hike through the cable route to the top is fantastic. It takes around 6 hrs up from Curry village. You need permit to climb in summer. In winters there's no permit as it is closed. But I went up anyways.

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Yosemite Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Hard to miss this iconic waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Standing at over 2,400 feet (700M), Yosemite Falls is one of the main attractions in the park. It consists of three separate waterfalls of varying heights. Two of which can be accessed via trails in the park with varying levels of difficulty. If you prefer a longer and more strenuous hike to get a better view of the other waterfalls we suggest hiking the Yosemite Falls Trail which can be taken all the way up to the top of the falls. This hike takes much longer between 6-8 hours and is 7 Mi (11KM) round trip but allows you to see the top of the falls and the creek that feeds into it along with being able to overlook into the valley. However, most opt to hike Lower Yosemite Falls instead due to its accessibility. These Falls are near the Valley Visitor Center which makes it easy to access either by car or the free shuttle (Stop 6) that runs through the park every 10-20 minutes. During peak times in the park including midday and weekends expect long lines to enter the park, and board a shuttle. This trail is a very easy 1 Mi (1.6KM) hike that is on a paved road which makes it accessible for people of all ages and fitness levels. It takes you up to the bottom of Lower Yosemite Falls which is the last of the three that make up Yosemite Falls. Below there is a rocky waterway in which people often enter to cool off but be cautious of the cold water and strong currents during certain times of the year. This trail often gets very busy during midday and can be hard to get a picture without other people in it. Going prior to 11AM will allow you to enjoy most of it without having to deal as much with crowds and get a better set up for your pictures. We suggest planning your trip months in advance if you plan on visiting during the summer months. Most campsites in the park are reserved months in advance so the sooner you can plan and reserve a place to stay, the easier things will be. If you are a small party who lives within a drive of the park we recommend staying in Camp 4. During summer months they offer a lottery drawing of camp reservations for the following day. For 6 USD per person/day you can have a simple shared campsite in the middle of the park. Visit the parks website for the link to enter the drawing which requires a 10 USD application fee. Since you can only apply one day in advance this option is only ideal for people within driving distance of the park. Although it was rough making the 11 hour drive out from Arizona it was worth coming back to this park for a couple of days!"
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Yosemite Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Wonderous!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Some people whine when the water is not flowing full blast, however I appreciate the way the Creator sculpted these beautiful Sierra and especially Yosemite. I love studying geology, so even when there is no water, there are wonderful things to see that are now exposed. The Valley is great year round, because of crowds, I usually go spring and fall. Don't let yourself be robbed of experiencing a beautiful place just because it's a low water year. I am mobility challenged and that doesn't stop me. I have been visiting Yosemite for over 65 years."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Yosemite Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,majestic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yosemite falls consist of Upper and Lower fall, I think the Upper fall is more powerful, more impressive, but if you just look at the Lower fall, it is also beautiful and fabulous. You can see the falls in many spot, e.g. in the Cook's meadow loop, swinging bridge, Yosemite falls trail, Glacier point, etc. You can view the falls from different angles at different place, and it's worth to see the falls from different view at different place. It has the most water in the Spring and early summer, while the fall may dry out in late summer, so better plan to visit it in Spring and early summer."
Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Yosemite Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Beautiful falls and easy to get to.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visit Yosemite Falls on every trip to Yosemite, as it is a very easy, straight, paved walk from Yosemite Valley Lodge to the falls. We've been there when there is very little water in the falls and we've been there when the water is coming down so fast and hard that you get wet standing on the little bridge watching it. Since it is very simple to access, there are a lot of tourists in that area, so bring your mask (Covid).   Also, on the way to the falls, about midway, on the left are the Spider Caves. You can crawl through from one end to the other.  The path is rather short, but tight and you need a flashlight.  There is no marker for the caves.  We didn't even know they existed, until my kids went through them on a school field trip years ago. In summary, I can highly recommend visting Yosemite Falls."

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Yosemite Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Upper Yosemite Falls Trail Review,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful! Upper Yosemite Falls Trail is HARD and can get very crowded in the afternoons. I suggest leaving as early as possible to avoid this. Our favorite viewpoint wasn't the at the top of the falls but the view of Yosemite Falls after the first round of switchbacks. We hiked in May and the weather was super unpredictable given the elevation gain. Definitely pack LOTS of water and appropriate clothing and hiking boots for the given weather on the day you hike. Lower Yosemite Falls is also beautiful but there is not much of a hiking trail to the base of the falls/viewpoint.

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Yosemite Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Upper Yosemite Falls,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I did the hike to the top of Upper Yosemite Falls 3 days ago. It's winter, but on my way back, there were still a lot of people going up the trail. I started this hike at 6:30 am, sharing it with only a handful of people and also beating the heat from the sun beating down on the trail. It's high moderate to low strenuous, but then again, I'm an avid backpacker, so that might not be a fair rating. I was able to do the hike, round-trip, in less than 4.5 hours. The best part of the trail is the views of the valley & Half Dome and then the views of Upper Yosemite Falls (about half way up). At the top, the views are just OK. But it's an almost constant uphill hike all the way to the top. My calves are still sore. I gave this hike 4 stars, as there were so many people on the trail coming up, when I was coming down. It looked like a line of ants. So, if you want to be on this trail alone, start very early, and you still won't be completely alone, but will have long sections alone."

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Yosemite Valley,Valleys,4.5,Mesmerizing!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The park is absolutely amazing and the sites unsurpassed!!!  We stayed in the little camp, Curry Village  (last minute cancellation), which worked for us.  It is extremely crowded and impossible to park many times.  If there is something you wish to see without crowds, be there when the gates open and plot your sites logistically, otherwise can be a two mile back up to get in at the gate, and so crowded to park and walk around.  We ate dinner two nights at the Ahwahnee which was good.  Highly recommend their cottages to stay instead of hotel, but need to make reservations well in advance of a year out.  I found the park accommodations to be a bit run down and in need of TLC.  Definitely do a dusk loop car ride, see amazing wildlife, bears, deer, elk, etc.  Was also 115 degrees when we went, so hiking was too hard and the waterfalls dried up.  I'm sure Spring would be optimal."

The plus about the water is that the Modesto river is spectacular, and the falls are flowing perfectly. Crowds are heavy this time of the year, so expect delays. The entry fee is $35.00, I have an annual pass and highly recommend getting one. Make sure to gas up before getting to the park. Enjoy yourself and the sites. "

The scenery is spectacular!  However a couple of items surprised me. We stayed in Curry Village in the platform tent which provided a Queen and two twin beds. It was clean and had necessary basic appointments. The density of the tents made for overcrowding at the 2 restaurants there so plan on eating early or late. Two other options for dining were not open this season which accounted for the long wait times. There was a nice cafeteria style breakfast option and a Peete’s Coffee. Bathrooms were adequate.

I understand there is no sewer system there and that the bathrooms are non-flush waterless toilet system called vaults. I get that. But there has to be a way those bathrooms have to be cleaned at least every two to three hours, considering the amount of people that visit the place. Worst bathrooms I've been to in all my life."

And, it's accessible via road before you go through Tunnel View.  In fact, you may want to take the right turn at the entrance as you are driving in before proceeding further into Yosemite Valley.

Yosemite National Park,California (CA),Glacier Point,Geologic Formations,5.0,A good view point to see some iconic features of Yosemite,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Glacier point is a high point so that you can see mostly of the Yosemite features at this points, including the iconic Half dome, you can also see 4 waterfalls such as Vernal fall, Nevada fall, Yosemite falls, they are majestic, you can go along the paved trail to see different view (at least 270 degree if not 360 degree of angle) of the Yosemite. Be aware  that if the parking lot in the Glacier point is full, then the road driving up to the Glacier point may be closed, so better go there earlier, but for the day we went (Monday in late June), there are still several parking space available at 10:30am, not sure if the parking lot will be filled up more quickly in weekends or in July/Aug, but in weekday of late June, still have several parking space at 10:30am. Of course you can hike up to here or from here, hike down to other points, but the trail is a tough one and takes several hours of hike. There are also ranger program in this site, I also post the photo of ranger program on that day, just for reference, it may changed from time to time."

The way El Capitan, Half Dome and Bridal Veil Falls are perfectly framed here makes this an amazing, MUST SEE sight.  I have been fortunate enough to see it twice and both times it confirms the existence of the Almighty.  It is perfect for pictures with people and all by itself.  It is a place you simply MUST VISIT if you come to the park.  It is truly amazing and incredible, beyond an ability for words to capture.

It can be crowded but the parking lot is pretty large and most people don't spend a lot of time here, so parking spots are usually available.

It gets very busy and it can take a few minutes to find parking.  It only took us 3 or 4 minutes because we happened to find someone pulling out.  However, it usually takes longer and requires some patience. The view of Yosemite Valley is spectacular and it provides a panorama of Half Dome and El Capitan and the valley.

We also see people bird watching there but we come for the buffalo.  We try to get there at dusk when the herds are settling down for the night.  We've seen baby buffalo frolicking while mom watches.  The herds could swim across the river to the other side sometimes causing ""buffalo jams"" on the road.  If you get there early, there is plenty of parking.  You can see the buffalo close up as they cross the road but stay in your car and don't get close to them as they are wild.  If you don't see any in Hayden Valley, try Lamar Valley a little farther north.  Happy viewing."

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lower Yellowstone River Falls,Waterfalls,5.0,Strong moderate hike with great views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fantastic viewing area of the falls is the lower falls! Just a reminder that it’s all downhill to view them, which means a pretty stiff walk back up that you will need to be ready for. The views are totally worth it, but some members of your family might find it difficult. Also recommend sturdy shoes because it can be a bit slippery on the way down due to the terrain. Overall highly recommend!"

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lower Yellowstone River Falls,Waterfalls,5.0,Worth the hike down,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The hike was a little tougher than I expected.  But so worth the view. If you see a big crowd coming I suggest waiting at a turn for them to pass. It got congested and some people didn’t have common courtesy to walk single file when passing other people and there are no railings. It was pretty scary since the trail is narrow.
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lower Yellowstone River Falls,Waterfalls,5.0,Worth the hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"WOW! This is a short (1/2 mile) walk down from the parking area to the viewing area of the falls, but it is extremely steep and has many switchbacks. I was amazed at how many people we saw wearing inappropriate footwear, like platform flip-flops. Be sure to wear comfy hiking shoes or sneakers!! And be aware that the steep climb down means you'll have a steep climb back up. There are plenty of places to stop and rest if you need to, but it is a climb."

I felt so close to the rushing water and the volume going past was impressive. I’m sure it’s nice from an overlook, but if you want the full effect, take the trail down. The trail is EXTREMELY steep so it’s switchback after switchback after switchback. I wouldn’t recommend doing it unless you’re  physically in decent shape. I continued on the North Rim trail and hiked up past Crystal Falls and on to the Upper Falls. I didn’t encounter one single person and the views were spectacular, but when I got to the overlooks, they were packed"

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Mammoth Hot Springs,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Room for improvement!!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,This property is amazing. The staff needs much training. I really liked the cowboy guy he is a great operator and I liked the whole cowboy thing he had going on. Our room was amazing. The decor is so cool. The property is well maintained. They had so many things closed due to the pandemic that they really should just close completely. I was sent no less than four emails with info regarding wearing a mask due to the pandemic but said nothing about all the stuff closed or not available to guests. If I had known about the lack of amenities like no coffee maker in the room or offered at nearby restaurant next door due to water being turned off at 10am and check is at 11am. No ice machines operating I would have booked another hotel. Xterra who manages this property is one of the largest but worst companies in the hospitality business.

If I’m going to be honest, it wasn’t my favorite part of Yellowstone, but I’m glad we went and I’m glad it’s one of the first things we saw. I think we spent a good 90minutes exploring both terraces. I would have liked a little more time in this area to go to the Visitor’s Center, so I’d plan a solid 2 hours to really experience this section of the park."

This is apparently the largest high elevation lake in North America. The routine water temperature is too cold to safely swim in for more than a handful of minutes, but fishing and boating is permitted consistent with the park's regulations. You can explore the West Thumb area where hot spots and fumaroles abound and seem to contradict the coldness of the lake. if you're here near winter, this is a particularly scenic snowy location. If you move north from here, you'll pass a number of lakeside picnic spots as well as the serene scenic loop of Gull Point Drive. Fishing Bridge/Lake Village is the commercial center and then you can continue south along the lake's north and east borders. You'll find an overlook point as the road starts to drift away toward Cody. Hikers can follow the east flank south. The park service concessionaires offer guided activities on and around the lake. Take advantage of these if you like."

A knowledgeable guide, Jack was also personable and made the 2 hour trip fun and informative. The guys caught fish and we ladies relaxed on the boat, taking in the sights. We heartily recommend the experience. "

We saw that there were multiple eruptions in a 2 hour window so we booked it there to see them all. We saw Grand, Castle, Riverside, Daisy (from the trail) all before heading to Old Faithful. Old Faithful is the most frequent so plan around the rest and save it for the end. Also lots of shops and food nearby so you can plan a good deal of time here."

Of Old Faithful is the main attraction here but the number of geysers and thermal ponds in unbelievable. We were fortunate to see Beehive erupt as well as watching Old Faithful 3 times.

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Upper Geyser Basin,Hot Springs & Geysers,5.0,"Spectacular, in a different way, in winter",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The basin is spectacular, in a very different way, in winter.  It was like a visit to Jenny Lake (Grand Tetons) or Crater Lake - every couple of steps I stopped and wondered if this was the most beautiful view, then repeated it several steps later.  The geothermal features combined with the basin formation and heavier cold air causes rime on the trees and anything upright, making it look like the entire area has been flocked for the holidays.  Other than Old Faithful, the geysers aren't monitored for timing by the Park Service and the features aren't as striking without snow cover and ice - but the rime adds a wonderful new dimension that I think is undersold by the NPS.  Add to that, the walk around the upper basin is packed down, easy to follow, and solitary.  I encountered just four other people the entire three+ hours I was out on a gorgeous, sunny morning."

We walked from Old Faithful to the Morning Glory Pool because I'd heard it was a must-see. It truly was spectacular, but it took an hour and a half for my kids, ages 5 and 7, to make it there, and then they had to walk back. Take a stroller if you have littles. Bonus is that there is a bathroom near Morning Glory Pool. We saw multiple geysers erupt, steam vents, and gorgeous colors in the hot pools. Definitely a must-see!"

Make sure walk the complete boardwalk and enjoy the geyser features along the way.   Enjoy the education center and watch Old Faithful spout out.  There was even a resting Buffalo by the road as we drove in.   Remember to look from a distance and do not disturb them.
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Upper Geyser Basin,Hot Springs & Geysers,5.0,Old Faithful is the attraction,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Unless you're crazy about geysers and such, I'd skip this except for OF then do West Thumb and go to Mammoth HS to see the terraces. Our fav hike was Fairy Falls (just a really nice hike) where you see Imperial Geyser as well. We did several of the other short geyser walks like Fountain Paint Pots to get your fill with more diversity than this hike."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Great spot ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I went here very early in the morning to make sure I could socially distance.  It’s a truly beautiful spot. The whole park is great but this area is really nice. Great spot for pictures. Didn’t see any artists. 
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Must do viewpoint in Yellowstone.  Pictures are almost surreal!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As far as viewpoints go in Yellowstone, this is a must do.  The colors and the dramatic falls would be enough for the best visual experience and photo op, but when looking at our pictures with the contrast of the river and the canyon walls, they almost look like professional paintings.  (I don't have an expensive camera with multiple lenses, by the way.)"
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,South Loop Splendor ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Artist Point offers up a fantastic view of the falls and canyon. There are multiple views like this on the north and south loop however here at artist point you can really capture that iconic image. Plenty of parking and other trails to venture.
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Yellowstone Lower Falls - My Favorite Spot,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Lower Falls are by far the biggest waterfall in Yellowstone, and the 308-foot-tall waterfall is reportedly the second most photographed attraction in Yellowstone, with Old Faithful being first. There are numerous views of the Falls from both the east and west sides of the river and most require only a short walk or virtually no walk at all to get a great view. Over my lifetime I’ve been to Yellowstone 5-6 times, and I think this is probably my most favorite spot. And yes, I know with all the unique spots in Yellowstone, it’s a hard choice to pick just one. We liked it so much that we purchased a Thomas Moran Giclee Print (reproduction that is painted on canvas) that we had framed and hung right above the sofa in our living room. Moran painted his famous view of the Lower Falls (technically from the other side of the river) after accompanying the Hayden Expedition in a federally funded geological survey of Yellowstone in 1871. The painting came to the attention of the U.S. Government and was very influential when Congress considered the Yellowstone National Park Bill of 1871. Yellowstone was established as the first national park in the United States in March 1872, and Moran's painting was subsequently purchased by the government and hung in the US Capitol until 1950. It was then transferred to the U.S. Department of the Interior Museum where it still hangs. The Lower Falls area is located just to the east of Canyon Village campground which is a great place to stay if you are camping. Don’t make a trip to Yellowstone without visiting the Lower Falls.

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Great views ; easy access,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were here in the third week of October 2022. It’s just a short walk to the lookout point where the artist point is located and you can see parts of the Yellowstone Grand Canyon. There were two painters that were doing their artwork painting the landscape of the Lower Falls while we were there. In addition to seeing the Lower Falls you can also see the many colors of the canyon walls.
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,One of the best spots in Yellowstone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It’s hard to find words to describe how beautiful this area is. I had no idea that this existed in Yellowstone and I’m so glad we took the time to see this part of the park. Give yourself time to take in the beauty around Artist Point, you will not regret it."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Crowded - but worth it,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you can hike from the falls on the south rim trail, do it. But it's long there and back.  We had half our party drive and wait and the other half hiked it. You can also drive to artist point and hike back for about 10 minutes. Great views and you can stop and turn around when the trail gets really steep. "

My wife & I enjoyed the views from here.  Different angles produced totally different pictures.  Easy to get to this awesome spot."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Often photographed view,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My favorite view of the River, canyon, and waterfall. It isn’t called Artist’s Point for nothing. It is the image often photographed of the canyon. It changes color depending on the time of day. Morning light is probably the best. But, it is lovely any time of day."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Artist Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Most popular canyon viewing spot!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The most popular area to view the canyon and falls that everyone in your party can do. You will get out of the car and right to the viewing area, not much hiking at all. This is also the most popular spot to view the falls and canyon, which it did not disappoint.

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Old Faithful,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Impressive but not Awe Inspiring,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Given all the hype surrounding Old Faithful, it would be surprising if it truly lived up to its reputation.  In my opinion, it did not.  It is an impressive geyser but, at least when we saw it erupt, the plume was not as big as some photos I have seen.  Still, it is a big geyser and the big plus is the fact it is predictable and accessible.  We saw it on a sunny morning with about 300 other people in early September.  It was easy to get to and easy to view.  Impressive, but frankly not awe inspiring."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Old Faithful,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Keep your expectations low and you will love it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Because it's the most famous geyser, most people have super high expectations of this geothermal feature of Yellowstone.  Since I had heard it was ""just ok,"" I went in expecting ""not much"" and instead LOVED IT! It's astounding to think that every 75-90 for YEARS, this geyser has spurted 8,000 gallons of water over 100 feet in the air! I thought it was absolutely amazing, and I am so happy that my family and I got to witness it. We heard the first eruption of the morning was at 9:17, so we arrived around 10:15, and someone in the crowd told us the next eruption was estimated at 10:54. We secured a place on the boardwalk for our party of nine (most of the seating was taken), and waited. It was pretty hot that day and there is no shade here.  Make sure to take water and a few smart people had umbrellas. There was quite a crowd, but we packed lunch so we wouldn't have to fight the throngs of people. The thing is... after you watch Old Faithful, you can walk Upper Geyser Basin to see multiple features! If you walk the entire two miles, you can witness the awesome Morning Glory! Just be prepared with water and grit to take this walk there and back.  It was worth it, but I'm not sure everyone in our party was mentally prepared for it. I loved every single site, and we got to see another geyser in the basin erupt as well.  Highly recommend to put on your patient panties and just take your time! Unforgettable!"
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Old Faithful,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,The Quintessential stop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Old Faithful is the poster child of Yellowstone. It erupts every 1 1/2 to two hours. There is not much shade so remember the sunscreen. There are plenty of places to view the eruption. The eruption is also very quiet, not loud like you might expect. Because it is the most popular spot, expect a lot of people and long lines for food and at the gift shops. At this time they are still using some Covid protocols making lines even longer."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Old Faithful,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,What a sight!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"While the eruption times are getting farther between, It's a must see if you go to Yellowstone and the highlight of most everybody's trip. We waited almost an hour and a 1/2  for it to go off, but I got a good 2 minute video of the eruption.  There were several Bison around the geyser so many park rangers had to be around to keep everyone at least 25 feet away. The eruption was amazing, shooting several hundred feet into the air at it peak.  There is a restaurant, bathrooms and a visitors center on the grounds to get more information and maps of the park. During peak times of the day, parking hard be hard to find so get there early. "
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Old Faithful,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,A Yellowstone Right of Passage!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Watching Old Faithful Geyser erupt is a Yellowstone National Park tradition. People from all over the world have journeyed here to watch this famous geyser. The park’s wildlife and scenery might be as well-known today, but it was the unique thermal features like Old Faithful Geyser that inspired the establishment of Yellowstone as the world’s first national park in 1872."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Old Faithful,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Check Prediction Time,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Check the nps website for the prediction times to eruptions for Old Faithful and all the different geysers around.   We also did the 2 mile bike route to Morning Glory and discovered other geysers along the way.  It was paved and easy to get around.  Old Faithful gets really crowded during show time.  We decided to stay in the OF lodge on a cabin with one double bed.   It was super convenient to end the day here and started early the next morning.  We saw OF erupt multiple times because we stayed on site.   Loved exploring the area!
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Old Faithful,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Worth waiting for!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Definitely a bucket list item!  Need patience to wait however!!!

So many pictures as not sure ""when"" it will really blow, is it now?  nope!  lol.  But definitely something to see,  just be patient!  You will know when it is done!   Beautiful park and so much to see!  If you don't have a chair to sit while waiting there are plenty of logs to sit on."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Old Faithful,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Always a treat to see this marvel of nature!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This beautiful geyser is always exciting to see.  During our visit there were quite a few people, so we stayed away from the crowd and viewed two eruptions whilst hiking around to the other features nearby.  Most people were wearing masks, so I felt pretty safe.  The down side is that the visitor center is closed, and there is one main outdoor restroom for the entire place, so there was a wait of about a half hour. We found a one seater near morning glory pool, which was clean and only a minimal wait, but quite a walk west of the Old Faithful visitor's center. Be aware that there is often road work, and traffic congestion this year.  I did note an absence of tour buses, but more RV's than usual."

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,A different year,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a general review about the park during Covid 19.  I have been to the park many, many, times and this  is a totally different experience.  That being said I want to give my general impression about our experience.  It is not your typical experience in the park.  All service are very limited.  Expect huge crowds at old Faithful, and the geyser area.  Not all peopLe are wearing masks.  The old faithful inn, the Lake Hotel, all sit down restaurants, and the  visitor centers are closed.  The options for food are limited, it is all take away, and the lines are long.  August is always one of the busiest months in the park, and with so many things closed it makes it a little more challenging.  The beauty of the park is the same and some of the less popular areas are not crowded at all.  I love staying in the park when things are normal BUT during Covid I would recommend either staying in Gardner, Montana or West Yellowstone where the food options are much better.  I would recommend bringing your lunch I to the park and avoid the food service.  I think it will be less crowded in September or the first few weeks in October.  If you want the true Yellowstone experience I would wait until Covid is under control so you can get the full experience of this wonderful park."

This winter destination is not for everyone. It can be extremely cold, windy and snowy. Planning isn't easy and making sure children will enjoy the experience is paramount; I'm hoping this review will be helpful to others. Reservations open in mid March for the following winter so plan early. When you get lodging, sign up for the snowcoach transfers and make dinner reservations for all nights to avoid standing in long lines or eating far too late!"
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,Must Do ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Yellow Stone NP is much larger than I envisioned. Grand Loop takes you through and by most of the “must see” stops and even then you barely scratching the surface the park. 
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,The animals loved the COVID 19 shut down,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The animals loved the park closure. Two days driving through the park and we saw over 30 animal species!  It was the most animals we've seen on any of our trips to National Parks. Day one the social distancing was decent on the trails. All the visitors' centers were closed. On the second day, the park had tons of people and very few even tried to follow social distancing, and even less were wearing masks. The stores did have an employee at the designated entrance to only allow limited customers in the stores at a time. Tower to Canyon on the main loop is closed for construction and Fishing Bridge construction continues making for delays. Some parts of the park were still closed off due to COVID 19 restrictions but we were not disappointed in what was available to see. We had a great (but sunburnt) time."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,No showers in the campgrounds and no exhibits in the visitor centers.  Thats bison %&$*,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We just spent a week at Yellowstone NP in the Grant Village campground again for a week and what a disappointment.  The second day we were there we asked the person at the desk at the Grant Village Campground how showers work this year at the park.  The gal at the desk said there where no showers avaiable at any of the campgrounds in the park.  She recommended bathing in the lake.  At no point were we notified in the reservation or confirmation process that showers were not available.  She said it was due to staff shortages.  We also went to several visitor centers and NONE of the exhibits were open, but ALL of the gift shops.  The ranger behind a piece of glass said it was due to staff shortages.  I asked if it had anything to do with Covid.  He said, ""Well, that too.""  So riddle me this, I can be back to back with people crammed in a gift shop to buy a shot glass with a bison on it, but I can't see any of the exhibits in the SAME building.  Wow.  National Park Service, you let us down."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,First time visitors,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I finally was able to visit YNP. We visited on their first week of opening in June 2020. The hotels and lodges were still close so we stayed at an air bnb in Island Park, ID which is about 30 minutes from the west gate. The park was not crowded so it was a nice experience. We entered the west gate for 2 days and from the Jackson Hole entrance on the third day after visiting Jackson Hole. Our drive from Jackson Hole was great since we saw Bear and a cub and most of the Bisons and deers are most active since it getting dark at that time."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,National park worth seeing.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nothing to add in regard to the astounding sights others have detailed, but just warnings to newcomers: there is one main road that circles the park like a figure 8 and it is a 2-lane, generally well below 35 mph. It takes about an hour to get from the top of the park to the south end if you drive straight through without stopping and it might take much longer depending on the wildlife. Visitors cause traffic jams by slowing down in the road despite signage everywhere telling you not to do so, just to stare at animals. Most pull off to do their admiring of the wild bison, elk, wolves, bears and massive massive ravens that can unzip backpacks, but a good third just slow down while driving. If that doesn’t congest traffic, the animals can do it themselves: we had several incidents of having to stop to allow various mammals to saunter across the road and once, there was a bison and her adolescent calf walking along the oncoming lane, IN the oncoming lane. The cars behind were stacked up at least 75 deep with more coming every minute so there was a probably 100-car  backup before the bison eventually left the tarmac for a side meadow. So plan ahead! "
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,"Yes, it IS that good!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a place of more facets than you might image. Yes, they haev geysers here, and many different types of them, but they also have gorgeous meadows, enticing rivers, a massive lake that looks like a sea, incredible waterfalls, majestic valleys, herds of bison, elk and deer, and just about any wild creature you can imagine. Expect to face traffic jams as tourists crawl past the wildlife (but DON'T feed them) on the many, many miles or road in the park. Do not come for less than 3 days, and if possible make reservations FAR ahead of time to stay in the park. It was worth the exorbitant cost of staying in an on-site hotel."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,"Nature is always open, even during a pandemic!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yellowstone was as beautiful as ever.  This visit I noticed an absence of large tour bus groups, but an increase in RV's and traffic.  Restroom facilities were limited in some areas, with longer waiting in lines.  On the up side, the geysers perform as beautifully as ever, and the more you stay away from the popular venues, the more likely you are to enjoy the visit.  Grand Prismatic Pool was very crowded, but otherwise we were able to drive around and walk through many beautiful geyser basins. Face masks were worn by the majority of visitors, especially near Old Faithful where it was much more crowded.  Take along some extra hand sanitizer, and bring water and food, as the eating venues are not open at present."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Yellowstone National Park,National Parks,5.0,Absolutely stunning and huge,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You will need a couple of days to be able to travel to North, South, East and West of the Park.  The distances are huge.  We visited mid September and it was possible to do this in 2 days as the traffic was not too bad but it was busier on the weekend.  Queues build up unexpectedly when people spot an animal and then park up on the road instead of in the lay-bys and there is no way of getting past them.  We arrived from Cody to the East and it is quite a long journey before you even get to the park entrance.  We bought a America Beautiful pass which covers you for all the national parks for a year and means that you can join a different queue at the entry point - available online by post or on entry to some of the parks.  Day one we did the East and North and then day two we did the West and South of the park.  My favourite part was the grand prismatic spring.  Bring your own food and eat in designated picnic areas as there are not many places to buy food - but plenty of loos!  A wonderful experience."

Because of its beauty, it is also very busy. 4 years ago we took the boardwalk out to the springs. This time we decided to hike the Fairy Falls Trail part way to view it from above; that is where the pictures were taken. The lookout area from above is very small but we hiked it at 5:30 PM so it wasn't terribly busy. The parking area was still pretty full as was the boardwalk. The AM steam off the water likely pushes the crowds off until later in the day. Grand Prismatic Springs is a must see when visiting Yellowstone NP."

There are 2 ways to see Grand Prismatic Spring.  The easier option is by walking the board walk at Midway Geyser Basin.  The second is by parking at the Fairy Falls Parking Lot and walking the 1.6 miles round trip to the Grand Prismatic Overlook.  We did both on Thursday, 9/3 and I would recommend both because when you see the Grand Prismatic up close, you don't really see the colors and perspective you would at the Overlook.  The Overlook hike is DEFINITELY worth your time and energy."

The overlook platform is often filled with visitors trying to get that perfect photo.  The weather also plays a role in determining if the Grand Prismatic Spring photos are crisp and clear or fuzzy.  There is also a point on the trail before the overlook, where you can see most of the Grand Prasmatic Spring, yet the best view is from the overlook."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Grand Prismatic Spring,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Take the Hike to the Overlook,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Fortunately a national park ranger told us about the Fairy Falls Trail that provides an incredible, worth-it view of Grand Prismatic Spring from the trail's overlook.  We could see people below walking up to the spring on the boardwalk trail, but to have the view from above was truly Grand!  The Spring is gorgeous, colorful, crystal, worth remembering.  There is parking at the Fairy Falls Trailhead. You'll walk a paved path and will be on the same path at that point as others who may be going on to the lower level boardwalk.  Perhaps at .2 or .3 miles you'll see a dirt path that heads to your left.  That's the trail to the overlook.  The elevation is not daunting by any means.  At the overlook there's a nice wood platform with plenty of room for viewing.  If in the Yellowstone NP in the future, we would definitely do this trail again.  On our walk back to the parking lot, we were rewarded with seeing several bison in back of the parking area that we stood and watched for  a while.."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Grand Prismatic Spring,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Fairly Falls Trailhead for Best View,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Grand Prismatic is visually stunning and although the close up views are good you really should take the Fairy Falls trailhead to the overlook for the best view. In addition the FF trailhead parking is far less congested and in my opinion just a better experience of the spring. The trail is an easy walk with just a small portion of the trail being moderately challenging. 
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Grand Prismatic Spring,Hot Springs & Geysers,4.5,Worth the Wait,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Even though we were on ground level with the spring and the steam was blowing our way, I still thoroughly enjoyed Grand Prismatic Spring.  It would be best to have both the view from the ground AND find the overlook, but we didn't have time for both.  The parking lot was very crowded and we had to wait for a spot to open up, but I guess I am a sucker for geothermal features such as this one because to me, it was worth the wait.  Just don't know where in the country you can see something of this magnitude! I highly recommend it and it's nice because you get to see some other features on the way to the Grand Prismatic Spring."

He was at the base of the mountains & you could see him weaving in & out.  We also saw an eagle on the way to Prismatic Springs.  This is the most stunning spring in Yellowstone in my opinion.  The ranger told me that the morning time is generally cloudy, not giving the best view (with the steam also adding to low visibility), but he told me that every afternoon it ""burns off"" to give really nice clear views.  We were there in the morning.  Regardless.....we loved it!  The colors are unbeatable.  Mother Earth is SO BEAUTIFUL!!!  I'm so grateful to live in a country where we have the honor and privilege to ENJOY such beauty.  Priceless!  🙏👌"

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lamar Valley,Scenic Drives,5.0,3day couch tour,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"3 days. Temperature 0 or below. What they don’t tell you is your sack lunch must be eaten outside of the bus. Only snowmobiles are allowed in the heated lodges except Old Faithful. They let us in the there the first day. Days 2 & 3 outside huddle along the highway at a turn off. Swallowing a cold deli sandwich at negative temps is like jugging an icicle. In hindsight a coffee thermos would have been nice. Wear insulated ski clothes. Our guide was fabulous. 1st day Old Faithful, mud pots, geysers, bison pretty good. 2nd day Lamar Valley & back total snooze. At one point we got out of the coach/mini school bus and counted the number of icicles hanging off the cliff. Lunch huddled off the highway. Then nestle your lunch bag in the snow drift while you chew your sandwich & walk to remain unfrozen.  Day 3 stupendous ride amongst the bison. Stop at a lodge with heat & flush toilets. Then dine outside using the coach back grill to eat your food.  I gave up in frozen disgust. Back at Mammoth Lodge by 2:30 - 3 you can only purchase a drink & appetizer at dinner. You can not buy a hot chocolate. You cannot pop microwave popcorn & your darling husband can not get lucky ‘cause his wife is beyond frustrated.   All these charms are yours for $1K a day."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lamar Valley,Scenic Drives,5.0,Our Lamar Valley was blanketed in Buffalo!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent 4 days in the park and, honestly, the second day was THE BEST megafauna day!  We saw Lamar Valley blanketed in buffalo, 5 adult bear, and 2 bear cubs.  We at least drove all of the open major roads and walked almost all of the wooden paths.  I think the best times were between 7 pm and 9 pm when most folks had gone home for the day.  It was nice to have most of a national park to ourselves!  NOTE: This is an exaggeration, but compared to blocks of backed up cars at the West Yellowstone entrance, occasionally passing someone else is almost alone.  Some of the small areas we really did have to ourselves."

She said Hayden Valley is where all the wildlife was.  This year it was Lamar.  Bear, Elk, and Bison standing and snorting in the road.  Be careful!  These dopey things will go from calm to running without caring what’s in there path.  Slow rolling by one in the road is a BAD idea.  I did it and nearly got my rental destroyed."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lamar Valley,Scenic Drives,5.0,Highlight of the trip!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is definitely the highlight of our trip! We rode through at sunrise and saw a wolf pack playing by the river, grizzly bear running around, pronghorn, fox, moose (2 of them), and of course bison... very large herds of bison! The wolf pack, grizzly bears, and pronghorn were barely visible to naked eye so bring your spotting scope!! The next day we rode by again during sunrise and saw all that I previously mentioned but the wolf pack was even further away and the bison were not at the road like they were the day before."
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lamar Valley,Scenic Drives,5.0,Great for wildlife viewing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We'd read that the Lamar Valley is one of the best areas in Yellowstone to view wildlife so we took a detour from Cody to enter the park via the northeast entrance.  In the middle of the week in September, there was no traffic taking this way.   Once past the main gate it wasn't long before we saw a large herd of Bison.  This was followed a few miles down the road by elk.  To get your first fix of Yellowstone or one more peek at wildlife in the park before departing, we can highly recommend this area."

Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lamar Valley,Scenic Drives,5.0,Bison herds everywhere if you get there early,5.0 of 5 bubbles,we had a very early start (5:30 am) from our hotel in Gardiner to reach Lamar Valley before it got busy. Bison herds were along the road grazing. So many calves were playing with each other.  We also saw a lone pronghorn deer and a coyote jumping around nearby. On the way back (around 12 pm) there was a line of cars but the herds of bison were farther away from the road.
Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming (WY),Lamar Valley,Scenic Drives,5.0,BINOCULARS ARE AN ABSOLUTE MUST,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nothing I can say will adequately describe the thrill of seeing the wildlife here. We were staying in Mammoth so we can here nearly every night of our week long trip. We saw wolves on three occasions, black and grizzly bears, elk, bison galore, pronghorns, deer and a fox. Seeing the bison up close is special, getting caught in a bison jam is kind of fun. Don't fool yourself, you need to splurge on those binoculars, get a good pair. The animals are often far off, especially wolves and bears and you'll be out of luck if you don't have binoculars. To see the wolves is thrilling. You'll see bison any time of day, but come at sunrise and sunset and prepare to be amazed. People saying they don't get the hype need to drive slow look up from those darn phones!"

Nevertheless it is a magnificent sight! Best viewed early in the morning (say before 10 am) or late in the day (say after 5 pm) to avoid the enormous crowds which are visiting Artist Point or the observation points on the North rim drive. The views from Artist Point are very good indeed.

We then took the trail to Uncle Tom's point and back. The trail was about 1.75 miles with some moderate inclines. This was one of the definite highlights of our trip to Yellowstone. I am pretty fit for 50 and I felt the hike was enough of a challenge... the payoff of these majestic views were worth every huff and puff.

Nabesna,Alaska (AK),Rambler Mine Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Short but tough,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a challenging hike at the end of the Nabesna Road.  The road itself is fun and interesting to drive.  It’s rough for the last seven miles.  If it’s been wet and you don’t have a four wheel drive you might think twice about attempting to get here.  But once you park at the end of the road you walk on or around the unmaintained extension of the road to the trail head.  Then be prepared for a lung expanding half mile trudge straight uphill to a collection of mining artifacts and buildings and dramatic views.
Nabesna,Alaska (AK),Rambler Mine Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Rambler Mine Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The hike at the end of Nabesna road up to Rambler Mine was beautiful. Actually the trail it's self was ok but once at the mine the view was amazing and if you just walk a little further up to look out over the valley it is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. The trail is uphill and it's short but you gain elevation fast. The information from the National Park Visitor center was pretty accurate. I would very strongly suggest walking a little past the Mine to get the best view of both sides of the valley. We also saw Dall sheep at the top.

It is like having a park ranger with you while you are driving. This road is not recommended for RV's or low lying cars. If you drive carefully you can make it to mile marker 28 on the road (the road is 42 miles to the end) At that point you have to cross the first off three streams and 4 wheel drive is highly recommended. We had an RV and turned around at mile marker 28. There is a great campground inside the park which is free. This road is not often used, because it is off the beaten path, but we loved it. We went on a hike at Caribou Creek trail to the public use cabin (use also free). And loved every minute of it. Next time we will be back with a 4 wheel drive"

However, it is also a road with scenery you will never forget.   The road begins in Slana, a town about 80 miles east of Tok. You travel through flat and mountanious terrain, wile gaping at the incredible sights before you. I have been to the Alps and The Canadian Rockies.

Slana,Alaska (AK),Nabesna Road,Hiking Trails,4.5,The Road Worth Taking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A hidden gem of an Alaskan road --like your own personal tour of Wrangell St. Elias National Park & Preserve. We have been here several times, throughout the seasons and see very few other travelers so you have plenty of room to stop for exploring or taking great photos-- even with a basic cell phone camera. There's a good spot near mile 16-17 for an excellent shot of Mt. Sanford, the Tanada Peaks, and a small kettle lake (reminiscent of Wonder Lake in Denali minus the crowds and bus ride); at mile 18 wayside look for moose in the lake at the bottom of the hill; stop at the Rock Lake wayside for more great photos of the gorgeous mountains that seem to rise from the lakes below. The road is paved the first 5 miles or so and is gravel the rest of the way. Only a few potholes but otherwise good driving in our car to the Jack Lake bridge around mile 37. We have seen so many hawks, eagles, and other raptors flying along the road corridor; and several swans who nest on the various lakes. A curious but shy little fox hangs out near one of the picnic areas and a group of caribou often wander down the middle of the road in front of us, seemingly unconcerned with our presence. The mountains are incredible and seem to get bigger and more impressive the further down the road you go. There's a nice, fairly easy trail at Caribou Creek, and another one to Rambler Mine near the end of the road. The Skookum Volcano trail is a favorite as it winds through the forest up a scenic creek bed and above tree line into some impressive and surprising volcanic formations--red, orange, yellow, and black striations and spires you don't often see all together in Alaska. The view from up top is definitely worth it - keep an eye out for the Dall sheep up here! You can easily spend several days exploring this park which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, without having to take a bus ride or wait in line like Denali Park. Highly recommended for travelers looking to get off the beaten path."

We didn't have crampons or hiking poles and neither of us fell once or felt unsafe. The glacier was easy to walk on and incredibly beautiful. If you have $90, then the safety and security of having crampons and a guide is worth it. But you will be absolutely fine without one as long as you stay away from crevasses and the edges of the glacier. This is an absolutely incredible hike. "

Most people at Kennicott were taking a tour along the Root Glacier Trail to Root Glacier which took from four to six hours.  Time did not allow that many hours for me to do this activity, so did it on my own.  The trail was winding, narrow, and steep in places.  There was a steep area to get on the glacier, but not a difficult climb.  This was a great hike and was back in Kennicott in about three hours. "

As picturesque as the Harding Icefield trail without the 3,500 foot ascent, this trail offers forest, wash plain, mountain, and of course, glacier views as you make your way to the Stairway Icefall.  Trail is well maintained for most of the hike, but it does get more sketchy the further out you get.  There are also several boulder fields to scramble over, so you want to have good hiking footwear.  Besides that, bring a snack and plenty of water.  And, of course, your camera!"
Wrangell-St Elias National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Root Glacier Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Great Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed this hike.  I would rate it as an easier day hike.  I wouldn't step on the glacier if you don't have crampons...too risky in my opinion.  If you have crampons and poles - you will be fine without a guide.  The first part of the hike is somewhat boring, but it gets much better the second half with views.  The campsites along the glacier looked optimal.  Make sure you stop and have lunch and listen...you can hear the ice cracking under the silt/boulder section of the glacier...and occasionally a rockfall will happen.  This was fun.  Would totally do the hike again if ever in the area.  The hard part is getting to McCarthy/Kennicott.  Once there...the beauty is all around!"

There is also a free shuttle that takes you back and forth from the foot bridge to McCarthy and then another that will pick you up in front of the general store in McCarthy and take you to Kennicott for free.  Its called the Copper Center Shuttle or something close to that.  There is another one for $5 which I used the first time without knowing any better.

The National Park Service has bought as much of the town as they could, but there are numerous privately owned homes, cabins, and other buildings intermixed with the public buildings. A self guided tour is available, but spend the $27 and take the guided tour by the park concessionaire (St. Elias Mountain Guides). They have an office at the shuttle stop in Kennicott and are searchable on the web. The concessionaire has keys to the locked buildings that have been stabilized by the NPS and they lead you through, explaining the history and process along the way. You would miss that without the guide. One suggestion- the NPS offers a movie on the hour in the old general store building that explains how the whole mining process worked. The movie covers things the guides don't- watch the movie first, you will understand more. During the tour you climb up a switchback trail to the top of the ore processing building, the wind down 14 stories inside the building to the ground level."
Wrangell-St Elias National Park and Preserve,Alaska (AK),Kennecott Copper Mine,Mines,4.5,Horrible,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"1. In order to get to this National Park they recommend you purchase shuttle tickets and have them pick you up at your place. The road to get there is a two hour extremely bumpy ride. The driver told us that due to budget cuts and since Denali has a lot more visitors, they no longer fix the potholes. 2. We did the mill building tour since it was raining. They are trying to keep the building from falling down. I asked the person selling tickets how difficult it was since I am 62 and experience neck pain. He said the tour was 14 staircases going down so I purchased tickets. I do not recommend this tour for anyone other than young adults. It is very dangerous, you must wear a hard hat, you must walk up a muddy and slippery slope to reach the top. Then the staircases are dilapidated, you are warned about hitting your head on the way down, I am only 5'5"" and the stairs are not lighted (as they were not lighted in the old days), some of the stairs were so difficult we were told we might want to turn around and walk down backwards as if on a ladder. I was in tears and as soon as we reached the road level I left. The tour went down another two staircases."

It's a very scenic drive and there are at least 2 rest areas along the way.  Many places to take photos and view wild life.  We actually saw a lynx along the road.  Plan on spending at least $15 per couple just to get to the Kennecott Mine, unless you like to walk a couple miles each way.  It's $5 to park and $5 per person for the shuttle good for both ways.  Parking is limited at the Mine so you really should use the shuttle.  The mine is cool!  Some of the buildings have been restored by the Parks Dept. and the rest are going to be.  There is a Resort type lodge with fine dining and drinks too.  There are several shops and other places to get drinks or food.  Food is exspensive, $18 for a meantball sub and a bottle of water.  For a fee you can have a guided tour of the entire town but it is not handicap friendly.  We just walked the road and the buildings open to the general public since I use a cane and can't do the real steep hills.

They were a ways off so it wasn’t bad, but really I think the boaters got the better end of the deal. That’s because there was SO much coral, it was hard to find a clear spot to walk out. I think it’d be easier to boat in than to walk in for snorkeling. Also, after the long walk we couldn’t even enjoy a sit on the beach because it’s rough rocks. It was way too far to carry chairs too.  "

It is, bar none, the most beautiful place I have ever visited! When you approach Leinster Bay and look at the water, you are awestricken by the so many different colors--from a very light blue to a somewhat darker blue and the colors increase from there to a majestic darker blue----it is truly a site to behold! Also, it is located directly below the Annaberg Sugar Plantation so a family could greatly enjoy one-half to a full day at this location. To get the full benefit of Leinster Bay, you must either park in the Annaberg section, or to save walking time, slowly take a right at the end of the road and park as far as you can toward the area where you want to snorkle (I would advise this). You have to walk on a pathway for approximately 15 minutes, but when you get there you will enjoy a beautiful bay with plush landscape and, to me the best snorkeling that St. Johns has to offer. Be sure to snorkel out to Waterlemon Cay (approx. 150-200 yds.) where you will see the most beautiful underwater display of tropical fish, coral, sea turtles, barracudas, and a friendly shark or two.

It didn't hurt that the waters were fairly calm and the weather perfect, but the variety and quality of corals and fish were just outstanding... and my niece is now 'hooked' on snorkeling! Yay!"

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Jumbie Beach,Beaches,4.5,Nice beach ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I decided to stop here earlier this week. We liked it so much we returned there today. It is a small beach across from Trunk and a short walk from a small parking lot on North Shore Road. Beach sand is a little coarser than other beaches but the water is like bath water!
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Jumbie Beach,Beaches,4.5,"""Clothing Optional (nude)"", but nice!",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Jumbie Bay, a short ride up the hill and around a few bends from Cruz Bay, is your ""clothing optional, or rather nude beach on St. Johns"". You have to walk down a stairway which leads into a narrow pathway completely covered by foliage in order to get to the extremely nice, small, but secluded bay. Definitely not for the meek or mild, but more for the adventuresome, carefree type couple. Being bold and carefree myself, I even had uneasy feelings about being on this particular bay. There seems to be many more males than females who frequent this beach and the majority of the males are there, it seems, to get a quick look. It is however a very beautiful bay which is also frequented quite often by the tour boats in order for their patrons to get a few, choice snapshots (I don't blame them). Not for the faint-hearted, or jealous type, but exciting for the adventurous type couples. If you are bold, give it a try!"

We live and work on St. Thomas and a colleague had recommended this beach on St. John as we headed off there one weekend last summer.  Unless you're looking you'll almost miss it (although they recently paved a little area for parking :( )...a quick 200 feet down a trail off the West roadway... sweet little beach, fairly protected, not too many other folks,... perfect area for snorkeling (it's small enough that you can snorkel the whole cove/bay!)... it is our favorite and we stop there every trip to St. John!"

Respect the law and the people who live in STJ."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Jumbie Beach,Beaches,4.5,Terrific snorkeling!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Jumbie is another one of the fabulous beaches on St. John, but it's a bit off the beaten path, so it's a quieter beach w/fewer people. While one can snorkel along the bank, we found the best snorkeling a bit further out, along the bank, but around the point. In the deeper water, we saw a nurse shark, Queen Triggerfish, Queen and Gray Angelfish, Jackknife Fish, grouper, and many more. Also more hard and soft corals in the slightly deeper water. Use care though - best to be a strong swimmer. Love Jumbie!"

Jumbie Beach in within the boundaries of the USVI National Park and NUDITY IS NOT ALLOWED.  That said, people on St. John are tolerant of a wide variety of lifestyles, and most will not complain.  But rangers are required to enforce the law.  St. John really has no legally nude beaches that I can think of.  Rent a private villa and enjoy the sun's rays in private, or I suggest you keep your suit on at the beach and be sure of an unharrassed day in paradise!"

The path to the beach is very short (230 feet?) and the beach is nice, particularly if you head left while looking at the ocean since the beach at the entrance is rocky. The day we were there the surf and the current were fairly strong. Less parking means more seclusion. Bring your cooler, snacks and beach chairs. The beach has ample shade, so no reason to pack an umbrella."

The sugar plantation is on a beautiful bluff and is an easy walk (about 30 minutes). I highly recommend picking up the GUIDE paper at the VIsitors Center in Cruz Bay. Ask a Ranger for it. The paper gives an excellent history of the plantation. Without the explanation (or a guide) you won't know what you're looking at."

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Annaberg Sugar Plantation,Historic Sites,4.5,Nice Side Trip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to drive to this place and check it out. It was a good idea. The history of this old mill is quite interesting. It's a little run down and part of it is under repair and not accessible but you get to observe most of it. The placards situated around the property are well written and informative. You only need 20- 40 minutes to walk around and read the history. It was a nice diversion. Be prepared to walk up a long stairway if you walk from the parking area. You can avoid this by getting dropped off at the taxi stand . It's a little rugged so wear supportive shoes . There were on-line warnings and signs at the entrance to be aware of bees. Not sure why, there were none. And no explanation of what kind of harmful bees may be around. I know most ALL bees are harmless and not aggressive unless provoked. But if you're allergic to bee venom, take heed just in case. Enjoy this interesting place. "

There is a picnic table  near the windmill  and makes a great place for a lunch or snack. Keep an eye out for the deer  and butterflies. Late in the afternoon the  bay changes color . So put this on your to do list , Aside from all that it is an imprtant part of the island's history."

It's a great spot to walk, take in some history and enjoy the ruins. Simple enough for kids and there is ample parking. You can also part there to hike/gentle rock scramble over to Waterlemon. "
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Annaberg Sugar Plantation,Historic Sites,4.5,Sugar plantation history,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Annaberg was a short drive from Maho Bay beach and was a nice place to visit because it had ruins that were in fairly good shape and was situated above Leinster Bay which allowed for great views and photos. The ruin of the windmill was in very good shape and the pathways around the plantation were very easy to walk. I am not sure if a person with a wheelchair can access the area because there were several wooden steps to get up to it from the main entrance area below. Parking was not a problem for us, each of the three times we parked there we were able to find a spot; morning, noon, and early afternoon."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Annaberg Sugar Plantation,Historic Sites,4.5,Great visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I stopped here to visit a week or so ago. We hadn’t been here since staying at Maho Bay Campgound a number of years ago. The ruins were in great shape and the views were stunning. A National Park employee and a volunteer were there and they were very friendly and informative. The Garden was well maintained with many local plants and trees.

Its a   5 minute walk up stairs and then a self-guided tour around the ruins. There is a staff member who works in the garden there and he made our trip! Allowed us to try sugar cane, tamarind and coconut fresh off the grounds. He was a wealth of knowledge as well. You can tell he enjoys his job. It's free of charge but there is a donation bin at the entrance. 10/10 recommend!"
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Sea Turtle Delight,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Salt Pond Bay is a lesser visited bay on St. John if you feel crowded at some of the more popular beaches. Head east and keep going through Coral Bay and wait for the sign. There is a parking lot and a trail leading you to this wonderful place for beach fun and snorkeling. The trail is rocky, and downhill - so think about saving some energy for the walk back up on your way out. The beach has shady spots, trash bins and restrooms. The sea grass right out in the middle of the ocean attracts the sea turtles, you can't miss them. I watched a mama turtle and her baby feed for almost 10 minutes before I moved on to other things. Bring water socks to avoid the rocks and burrs away from the shoreline and this little bay can be all yours for the day."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Great Stop at Salt Pond Bay on our Tour with Sonic Charters,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We made a great stop at Salt Pond Bay during our tour last week with Sonic Charters.   It was a windy day, but Salt Pond was protected and the water completely calm.  The beach itself is beautiful, with white sand and some shady areas with picnic tables if you are looking to bring a picnic lunch.  There is a single, public bathroom, but no other services.  We stopped at Lime Out in Coral Bay and took out lunch to eat on the beach.  After lunch, we snorkeled in the crystal clear water and immediately found a stingray and two juvenile sea turtles.  To the right side of the beach, there is excellent snorkeling with lots of fish and some coral.    We definitely will return on our next trip."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Best snorkeling of our trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided to give this spot a try since it's rated as one of the top snorkel spots on St. John. We stayed near Coral Bay and the drive was not that bad. If you're coming from  Cruz Bay it's a long drive. When we arrived around 2 the lot was completely full and we parked a little ways up the road along the side. It's a short hike to the beach and I was glad I brought my sneakers. The beach is on the smaller side but we managed to squeeze in. Now, the most important thing: the snorkeling was excellent. The reef seemed in better condition than those on the north shore, and the water was very protected (no waves or wind on the day we went). There were rays, turtles, and tons of fish. Tip - don't sit too near the trees because there were tons of tiny biting flies. "
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Best beach for snorkeling!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The house we rented was close to Salt Pond Bay, and it turned out to be our favorite beach. Go early for a good parking spot, and be prepared for a walk down to the beach on a path that could be challenging to some. There are a few picnic tables and trees that will provide shade if you time it right. The beach is sandy and we saw a lot of young children playing in the shallow water. You'll see some fish and turtles closer to shore, but the best snorkeling is a long swim out to the rocks. My friend and I used swim noodles (under our arms) for assistance; we also saw snorkelers with life belts. My husband and 20-something sons swam to the 2nd set of rocks without assistance. We saw all kinds of fish and lots of colorful coral that made the long swim worthwhile. Though our original plan was to spend one day at Salt Pond Bay, we enjoyed it so much that we came back for a 2nd visit. We all highly recommend it!"
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Good snorkeling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was a great place for snorkeling, especially for kids.  There are some picnic tables, get there early to get one.  In the center of the beach, we saw several sea turtles.  To the left along the rocks we saw lots of fish.  If you swim along the right side, there is a very nice Elk Horn Coral.  There is a rock a good ways out in the center, but there was so much boat traffic coming & going, we were afraid to make it out there.  You can also hike to Ram's head which has some great views.  It is a little bit of a walk from the parking lot down to the beach.  It is uphill on the way back.  We saw someone walking around looking in everyone's cars, so make sure you lock your doors or don't leave anything in your car."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Hidden Gem,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Accidentally found this beach when looking for Coral Bay. Read reviews that Coral Bay was a spot to visit, didn't really find what we were looking for so we stopped here. There was about a 1/3 mile easy/moderate hike down to the beach. Had beautiful clear water and wasn't crowded at all. The drive was long from Cruz Bay because it's the other side of the island. Saw my first sea turtle! We hovered and watched the young turtle float around and eat. Tried to hit Lucy's for lunch on the way back to town, but it had just closed between the lunch/dinner shifts. I probably wouldn't hit this beach again just because of the distance but definitely worth seeing once if you have the time to cruise around the island."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Secluded start to good snorkeling.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I heard to not leave valuables in your vehicle in the parking lot. The trek down to the beach was not bad at all. It was 0.3 miles down. There was only 1 family on the beach when we got there around 9am. We found a great spot with some shade. We walked behind the beach to check out the actual salt pond. It was a shade of dark pink. There was a deer enjoying the salt. Back on the beach I think one would need to wear water shoes just upon entering the water. There are lots of small stones etc. We snorkeled for a long while because the water was so calm. Lots of beauty to behold under that sea. We saw one lone turtle with a stingray too. By this time the beach was pretty crowded. Overall a great beach though.
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Well worth the drive!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Wow! Visited Salt Pond Beach on St. John’s VI. We took the car ferry from St. Thomas and then headed to the opposite end of the island from Cruz Bay. It was well worth the trip and hike to the beach. There is only a few parking spots in the dirt and then you walk on a rocky trail to the beach, but it’s not difficult. The beach doesn’t have any amenities except a few picnic tables and we only saw 4 other people when we visited on a Tuesday morning. The sand is pristine white and the water calm and turquoise color. Snorkeling was exceptional and we saw various types of fish and some turtles. I highly recommend visiting this beach."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,One of the Best Beaches on St John,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Salt Pond Bay was by far, one of our favorite snorkeling spots and beaches. We rented a Jeep for the week so we didn’t use an excursion company. The underway sea life was incredible. Tropical Fish everywhere, saw a few Octopus nestled on Coral under the sea surface. Squid, Eagle Ray (HUGE), Leathernecks, so much to take in. You hike down a trail maybe. 1/3 of a mile to get to the beach. Wear hiking sandals like Keel. No flip flops. Take your cooler and snacks and plan on an entire day there. We spent two there. Watch out for the Wild Donkeys, they’ll come up and try and get into your things. But not threatening at all. Good for a video."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Salt Pond Bay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Worth the long  drive and swim for the best snorkeling opportunity,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We decided to stop here after reading the reviews about the snorkeling.  We decided to swim the distance to see the reef.  It was probably a quarter of a mile to get there.  The perimeter pales in comparison to this area.

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Hawksnest Beach,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful beach with strong waves!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The beach was beautiful!  I waded out into the water and could feel the undertow.  A big wave hit me and knocked me down and then a second wave came and literally shot me out of the water and onto the beach!

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Hawksnest Beach,Bodies of Water,4.5,Gorgeous and Unpretentious,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Gorgeous and relaxing....the beach was not crowded, had soft white sand, restrooms and picnic areas available. My husband and I got drinks, snacks, ice and a disposable cooler from the local convenience store and spent a whole day luxuriating in the calm, warm waters at Hawksnest Beach. Parking can be a bit of a pain as there aren't that many spots but waiting for one is WELL worth it to spend the day at this free federal park."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Hawksnest Beach,Bodies of Water,4.5,Morning in paradise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Had a free morning after the rest of the family left so spent it at Hawksnest. The beach was great and surf was soothing. Found some shade at the edge and set up camp there. Lots of families but spread out so easy to enjoy my book and some time in the water. Parking was tight as the island is full but some street parking near the North end is easy to use and I find the best place on the beach.
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Hawksnest Beach,Bodies of Water,4.5,A great place to go.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The parking lots at Trunk and Cinnamon Bay beaches were full and we managed to score a roadside, and potentially illegal, parking spot at Hawksnet Beach and we're glad we did.  Its not perfect like Trunk or Cinnamon Bay, but its a great spot.  There are good facilities and places to stay in the shade if you want to and the view is great.  Its a long-ish and semi-wide perfect white sand beach."

The current and waves were very strong, making it too sandy to see much for snorkeling. I am a very strong swimmer and the waves/current were so strong I did not feel comfortable out snorkeling alone though my family was on shore. My young children couldn’t play by the shore much at all as the waves were too strong. Definitely do not recommend for families with young children or for snorkeling. "

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Waterlemon Cay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Located at Leinster Bay and the Annaberg Plantation--plan on 1/2 to a full day there!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have seen this cay referred to as Watermelon Cay, as well as Waterlemon Cay in brochures and pamphlets, and I am still not sure of the correct name, however it is a wonderful place to visit. One must park and walk down an ocean-side pathway in order to get to (let's call it Waterlemon Cay)! It is approximately a 12-15 minute walk which leads to a very nice beach--good for sunbathing, but the snorkeling is absolutely superb. The cay is located approximately 200 yds from the shoreline at Leinster Bay. While swimming out to the small cay, which has many beautiful shells, one can see beautiful starfish, sea turtles, sometimes a harmless shark, and the many beautiful tropical fish which are so plentiful at St. Johns. While swimming to the cay, the water gets rather deep--approximately 15 to 20 feet, but it is not difficult to get there. Absolutely GORGEOUS sea shells are abundant on the rather tiny Waterlemon Cay. Large starfish are abundant around the cay, as well as many beautiful tropical fish. Be careful if you decide to swim around the cay, because the currents can be extremely difficult at times on the far side of the cay---only one of the times that I truly felt that my girlfriend who could not swim but was wearing a mid-riff safety belt and I were in a difficult situation. Swimming to the cay seems to provide no danger, but swimming around the cay can become rather difficult unless you are a strong swimmer. Probably some of the best snorkeling on St Johns. Waterlemon is very tiny, but is a great place to sunbathe, or to pick up seashells. It is probably the best place on St. Johns to see all of the different forms of sealife including a few sharks, some barracuda, some moray eels, who lie mostly underneath the coral, plus the very colorful tropical fish. I would not even think of going to St Johns without visiting this place. The water there is so beautiful that at times it seems that you can see 4 or 5 different shades of colors---absolutely gorgeous! The Annaberg Plantation is also located within a few hundred yards of Leinster and Waterlemon, so it makes for a good 1/2 to a full day's trip."

My cousin and I went here and had the best snorkeling experience of our trip (having also gone to Maho Bay, Whistling Cay, Francis Bay, Cinnamon Bay, Salt Pond Bay and Blue Cobblestone Beach).  There's a LOT of starfish in the sand in the bay.  Also feeding on the grasses in the bay we saw a sea turtle!!  Hanging out with this turtle was definately the highlight of my trip, it had two fish that stayed with it and it just kept eating the entire time we watched it.  Take the short swim out and around Waterlemon Cay to see some great deeper water coral and plants.  It was rather wavy so we didn't see too many big fish but there were plently of little ones around in the protection of the bay.  Great trip!!"
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Waterlemon Cay,Bodies of Water,4.5,The best road-access snorkeling on St John,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Waterlemon Cay is a must-visit site for snorkelers. Since it's at the end of Lienster bay and requires a 150+ meter swim many don't take the time to see it. This is one of the best sites on St John that doesn't require a boat to get to.
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Waterlemon Cay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful Snorkelling,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were able to gain access via a dinghey that we rented in Cruz Bay.  I would highly recommend making a day out of the dinghey.  My wife and I rented one for 4 hours during the week we were there, and it was by far the most fun of the week.  By renting a boat, you will not have to walk or drive to the beaches, and will have fun driving in the ocean to boot!"

Saw lots of rays, large turtles, fish.  You need to be in shape to fight the current, but it is well worth it.  Be sure and snorkel all the way around the island even on a cloudy day.  Don't go all the way around to the short route to the island or you will miss some great sights."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Waterlemon Cay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Dangerous! Exercise Great Caution!,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Be very, very careful snorkeling around this island. Myself, my husband, and our friend were caught in a very strong and dangerous current while attempting to snorkel around the island. We retraced our path to swim with the current, and then were caught in another one while on the return. My husband is a swimmer, and our friend does Crossfit, and both of them were struggling. It was a terrifying ordeal that left me shaken and upset for days. If they hadn't been there to literally tow me in, I'm convinced I definitely would have drown. Afterward, I found this thread on Trip Advisor warning people against the current in new moons and full moons (probably other times as well), and I'd like to post it again here, in hopes of maybe saving someone from a very bad fate."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Waterlemon Cay,Bodies of Water,4.5,Must-see snorkel destination,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just returned from a week long vacation in St. John. Waterlemon (note, it's water-lemon, not water-melon like I was calling it all week!), was our favorite snorkel spot that we were able to get to without a boat. We snorkeled every day while we were in St. John, but this was our favorite spot. To reach Waterlemon, you have a few options. You can park at the Annaberg ruins and walk along the easy shore-line path to Leinster Bay. You can enter the water along the eastern shore of Leinster and then swim along Leinster Bay (good snorkeling here too) all the way out to Waterlemon Cay. Or, you can walk along the eastern shore of Leinster Bay and enter the water close to WL cay. If you go this route, you save yourself some swimming, but do be careful because the water entry there is rocky and there are sea urchins. Another way you can access this snorkel is to hike the Brown Bay trail from the East End of the island (follow route 10 east past the Zootenvaal cottages). Brown Bay trail connects to the Johnny Horn trail, leading you right to WL. It's a bit of hike (and a hot hike at that), but it's a pleasant hike and you can then stop at Brown Bay on your way back from WL if you like. WL is simply a great snorkel, lots of turtles, starfish, schools of fish, healthy coral, etc! Follow the current to save on energy--usually going to be counter-clockwise around WL. Then you can take a rest on the little sand beach on WL before swimming back to shore. If you are only able to do one snorkel while in St. John, this is the one I would recommend. One item of caution: the shores of Leinster Bay are home to the Manchineel tree, aka the Death Apple tree. These trees (leaves, sap and fruit) are all toxic, so be particularly careful not to touch these trees, and to warn others in your party as well. The park service has some of these trees marked as toxic, but knowing what they look like so you can avoid them will help you enjoy your visit to Leinster Bay more!"
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Waterlemon Cay,Bodies of Water,4.5,"Great Snorkeling here; bit of a walk, bit of a swim",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"You've got to do a bit of walking to get to the best access point to Waterlemon Cay (the northeastern side of Leinster Bay), but the work is worth it. Getting to the cay requires about 200 yards of swimming through calm bay waters. Getting to the best snorkeling area, on the western side of the cay, requires more work. Once you get there, though, you'll find an interesting variety of coral and fish life. Very nice snorkel spot, perhaps my second favorite."

Got my passport stamp here. Recommend checking with the visitor center for road conditions before driving into this park. Ranger told us there is a creek that floods and can have a swift current. Told we would be ok due to the height of our truck and we have 4-wheel drive. The roads are rough and you will need to take your time. Please be considerate and stay on marked trails so you are not trespassing on personal property. Unfortunately, the day we visited we didn't spot any wildlife even driving several miles into the park."

The movie with ranger talk is very informative and gives a great overview of the park.

The Visitor Center was good. We did a short ranger walk that was informative and also watched the film about the park that plays every hour on the hour.

The park movie is one of the better ones, and the exhibits, including a 3-d map are good.  You can walk a short distance from the visitor's center and see the Wrangle mountains in the park.  To see more of the park would require driving in on long dirt roads or flying and unfortunately we didn't have the time."

Utilizing pandemic safety measures, some buildings, including the bookstore/souvenir shop were restricted, with merchandise passed out through a window, after selections made from outdoor racks.  The official park film “Crown of the Continent” though, was playing regularly (we found many parks closed their theaters), and provided superb footage of the park’s stunning scenery. The film is available on You Tube for the armchair traveler. The Visitor Center also featured a compact but impressive exhibit hall building, also with appropriate pandemic distancing features, which offered significant history as well as flora and fauna background. An outside deck area a short walk from the main buildings provided exemplary views of the Wrangell-St. Elias core mountains."

It's difficult to see much of it unless you have a high clearance vehicle to drive gravel roads or take a plane. That being said, the Richardson Highway does skirt the western side of it, and there is a free visitor center with information, educational exhibits, a movie, short trails and an overlook. The visitor center and museum/culture buildings were all attractive and informative. Staff were friendly and there were activities for children. The trail to the overlook of the Copper River and distant mountain range is paved and suitable for wheelchairs and strollers. You will have the best views on a clear day. Other trails are footpaths through the forest and down to the Copper River valley. Restrooms are available. The only negative is that mosquitoes were very bad here - some of the worst we encountered in Alaska - bring repellent! You can also see views of the mountains a bit further south on Richardson Highway at Willow Lake."

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Reef Bay Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Don't miss this hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the Reef Bay Trail on our first day on the island, in the rain. The trail mostly goes through the trees, so we were largely protected from the intermittent drizzle. The petroglyphs were easy to see and worth the short spur trail (0.22 miles each way, per the sign). The ruins are largely intact and have informational signs. The beach is small and rocky, but very picturesque. And deserted. I didn't think the uphill portion of the hike was as bad as others have described, but I'm used to hiking in the mountains of Colorado, and there's way more oxygen at sea level! It opened up and POURED as we were hiking up the last 1/2 mile or so, which eliminated the challenge of the heat. Despite being the queen of flip-flops, I recommend real shoes for this trail. I wore my keens, which were perfect. Definitely a must-do on St. John."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Reef Bay Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Come prepared,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We really did not do our homework on this one!  The hike is amazing with views of the mountains, ruins and lots of wild life.  My husband, 18 year old daughter and myself started around 1:30 in the afternoon.  Lesson 1 -start earlier in the day.  The hike back hit the hottest part of the day and areas that were in complete shade on the way down were blazing with sun on the way back.  We went only as far as the petroglyphs trail.  This trail was amazing and really deserves a moment to appreciate the history that you are touching.  We brought two bottles of water for the three of us, which we didn’t feel the need to use until the walk back, but due to the heat and exertion of the incline back we had to ration.  Lesson 2 bring more water than you think you will need.  Although the trail is well kept it is treacherous.  There are patches with loose gravel, wet slippery stones and dry leaves hiding other dangers, the latter resulted in me slipping, twisting my ankle and falling hard to the ground.  Each of us were wearing good walking shoes- Lesson 3 do not try this hike in anything but good walking/hiking shoes.  After a few minutes of rest we continued the two miles left of the hike as my ankle continued to swell and turn purple.  Even without a hurt ankle though the climb back up was very tough.  Concentrating on it however took my mind of my ankle until we got in the car.  Summary:  be prepared and enjoy."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Reef Bay Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,The most amazing hike with a big reward at the end,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of the best hikes we have been on. The trail has about a 24% grade at the top, which is easy to go down but more challenging to head back up. That said, it is 100% worth it to take your time and make your way down to the petroglyphs. Words cannot describe the carvings! They are amazing, and if you are lucky enough for the waterfall to be in action (rain dependent), it's even more beautiful. Take plenty of water (I had a camelbak which I drained during the round trip - 70oz total) and a snack or lunch in your pack and enjoy this hike. Hiking boots, sneakers or tevas will all work as the trail is well groomed. There are some rocky areas so take them slowly. Walking sticks are also helpful for those who don't hike often. Enjoy!"

A taxi to the trail head is $14, and if you do this hike in the week, the VITRAN stops at the trailhead. The start of the trail is at an entrance in a stone wall, and down a few steps. There are storyboards along the trail which describe the trail history, plants and animals in the park. The old stone drainage gutters are an interesting view on the trail, as they still are necessary today to ensure the stability of the trail. "

Pretty steep downhill at the start of the trail, which means its rough coming back up. The petroglyphs are fun to look at...unfortunately there was a dead deer nearby the day we were there. (We did see lots of living deer too which was fun) I loved reading all the trail signs with the fun history facts. The Sugar Mill ruins were fun to look at. The beach down at Reef Bay is not great, very shallow and rocky, with lots sea grass and maybe coral? Don't really know what it was, but I didn't want to step on it. But, I did have a great time climbing on the large rocks at the waters edge at the end of the trail. 100% would do this hike again."
Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Reef Bay Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Definitely worth the effort,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hike . Good idea  to take walking sticks  especially for the walk up  or at least the last half hour .  Most of the time you are in the shade  and sometimes it rains which was actually fun,  The beach itself was nothing to write home about but  if you walk up a bit  there is a mangrove swamp which was special. Definitely take the side trail near the bottom and see the petroglyphs and keep a look out for the lizards and crabs . Don't let  the hype  about  the difficulty put you off . Just keep some cold beers in the car and you have something to look forward to . We decided not to do the guided  tour since we like to take things at our own pace."

Virgin Islands National Park,U.S. Virgin Islands,Reef Bay Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Great hike, tough hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I am a hiker in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, therefore I am familiar with steep, difficult trails. I found the Reef Bay trail very enjoyable, however it is not a walk in the woods and quite steep at sections. The ruins at Reef Bay are very interesting to see, along with the Reef Bay house and the petroglyphs. If you are an experienced hiker, go for it. If you are not and not in the best physical shape, I would suggest skipping this trail. There are many more trails on St. John that are less difficult. If you still want to hike this trail, I may suggest descending the Reef Bay trail, and returning on the L'Esperance or Lamshure trail. Happy hiking."

The only reason for my rating is the cost/value for what you get. PROS: good vibe, good low key people (especially when few children are there. Avoid school break weeks for quiet). The beach is gorgeous and you are steps away. The cafe serves good food and often you can split a meal with someone as the portions are large.

We are avid campers and have camped in the Florida keys as well as Martha's Vineyard and many more rustic areas.  We had a family oceanside tent that was steps from the gorgeous Cinnamon Bay Beach!  We fell asleep to the sounds of the ocean each night. The sites included linens, towel, cookware, propane, stove and a grill.  The on site restaurant was very good and we especially enjoyed the breakfasts.  The store has the basics and the other markets on the island could provide more food if needed.  We found the staff all very pleasant and happy to share their favorite spots on the island for us to visit. We spent our days exploring beaches, snorkeling, parasailing, and fishing.  The only downside was the bites we all got from the no see-ums and mosquitos but that was a small price to pay for an affordable and amazing week!"

Turquoise waters, soft white sand beaches, underwater snorkeling trail park of the National Park, concession stands, and some shade from trees along the shoreline. It doesn’t get better than that!  We went over Christmas/New Years week so it was more crowded then usual but still well worth it. Parking is extremely limited!!!  Come early or prepare to walk a distance to maybe find parking along the roadside. In December weather is usually windy which affects snorkeling visibility and waves. However for those not from Virgin Islands, visibility was not awful. Markers in the water were 8-12 ft deep and you could still find them but it wasn’t “like glass” like normal when it’s not windy. Well worth the trip!!!  "

It can be quite crowded and that can be annoying after being on more out of the way beaches (especially when people are playing ball in the water and taking up a lot of space). It is a real challenge to get parking!  We were extremely lucky to get a space two days in a row, but it required getting there early (or late) and being very, very lucky.

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Pinnacles,Mountains,4.5,Easy Hike to the Pinnacles for Good Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This review is for the hike to the Pinnacles which is separate from the picnic grounds.  The Pinnacles is a rocky outcrop which gives you good views into the Shenandoah Valley.  The easy 2.2 round trip hike begins at the back of the second parking area for Jewell Hollow Overlook.  At the back of the parking area you will find a path that quickly leads you to the Appalachian Trail.  Take the AT North as you will follow the AT all the way to the Pinnacles.  The first part of the hike is through an open area that is directly below the overlook parking.  You get good views down Tutweiler Hollow.  You then enter the forest.  Most of the hike from here to the Pinnacles is uphill.  You know you are getting close as large boulders begin appearing along side the trail.  Continue until you come to the outcropping that gives you the views of the mountains north and west into the Shenandoah Valley.  Take time to enjoy the views and breathe the fresh air.  Note all the lichens on the rocks.  This indicates that the air is clean.  When you are ready, retrace your steps.  The nice thing now is that you will mostly be going downhill.  You should probably allow at least two hours for this hike."

We saw another couple waiting at their car watching a small bear (120 lbs approx) near the picnic area. I saw that the bear stayed about 50 yards from the entrance to the restroom so I went in. When I tried to come out, the bear was right there by the door. Luckily, I scared him away and the others motioned me to come on out. Before we left we watch the bear try to open the restroom doors."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Rose River Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Favorite Hike from Our Trip,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our favorite hike of the trip. I lost count of how many different waterfalls we saw! We did the 4-mile loop hike by parking at Fishers Gap Overlook and then crossing over Skyline Drive to the trailhead. There was a chain link between 2 yellow posts in front of the trail (I think to keep vehicles out), so we walked around that and went to the left first. This was at the advice of a travel blog so that during the hike you see the waterfalls as you approach them (so they're in front of you & it's more scenic), vs. coming at them from the other way around. We did the short .25 mile diversion to Dark Hollow Falls (totally worth it!), and then came back to our car via the Fire Road trail. The hike took us around 2 - 2.5 hours. I would say it was probably ""lightly moderate."" I would definitely do this hike again."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Rose River Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Nice trail but missed the falls,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the advice of a ranger and hiked Story of the Forest trail to the Dark Hollow Falls trail and then continued down hill to Rose River Fire Road. From there we picked up the Rose River Falls trail. We were under the impression that the falls were closer from this way. The trail from that entrance is all down hill, very rocky in parts, sometimes steep and hiking in running water in some parts (a hurricane had been in the area 5 days earlier). The trail is right next to the water with several small falls along the way. When we stopped a family coming the other way they told us these were the falls, so we turned around at a bridge to start the massive uphill hike back to the start of Dark Hollow. I wished we’d kept going! However, to see the Rose River Falls it is much easier to start at Skyline Drive and enter the Rose River Trail from there. "

Nature, waterfalls, wildlife, and a great trail. Not difficult and under the canopies of high trees makes it suitable for summer and rainy days .

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Rose River Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Low water levels,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We were a little disappointed in this hike. The waterfall wasn’t flowing as much as usual because there were low water levels. It had rained a little on our hike there so it was muddy and a little steep getting down to the base of the falls. This same path will also take you to Dark Hallow Falls.

My wife and I had a great time and saw so many little waterfalls in conjunction with the big one. Per the advise of an online reviewer, we parked at Fisher's Gap and hiked the loop in a clockwise direction (start on the Rose River loop trail and come back on the fire road). We are so glad we did, and we very much recommend the same. The fire road is much easier to walk, so it was an relaxing conclusion to a moderately difficult hike. We also went down to the Dark Hollow Falls and that was a worthwhile investment! It took us about four hours to hike. Be sure to bring some water and snacks."

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Rose River Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Rose river trail hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I did the Rose river falls/loop trail.  If you want to complete this approx.4 mile hike you really need to start out by going to the left on the horse trail for approx, .5 miles then picking up the rose trail.  This trail is 1.5 miles down to the falls and beautiful!  We then continued another 1.5 miles back up to the road that is another mile back to the  parking area. the actual hike is moderate in difficulty with lots of rocks and large roots but beautiful waterfalls galore. Some muddy areas. Once you hit the road, that is just a gradual climb on a dirt roadway."

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Rose River Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Do the Hike Clockwise,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Did the loop starting from the overlook parking lot down to Rose River Falls to Dark River Falls and up the fire road. The parking lot is the high point of the hike so the second half of the hike will be uphill no matter which way you go. The fire road is a gravel road with a flat grade so it is easy to do when tired at the end of the hike. Since it was spring the waterfalls were flowing nicely. The trees hadn’t bloomed yet so it wasn’t as scenic as it will be in a couple weeks. Second half of trail has lots of of rock stairs and other scenic items.

We mistakenly took the opposite path than is commonly recommended and I found it to be very challenging. I will say that it was 100% worth the exhaustion. Our daughter loved the hike. There was often active water and falls during most of the hike. Our Jack Russell also hiked with us. He has cancer but did amazingly well despite the very rocky final incline to the fire road. A beautiful hike on a crisp spring day."

My 6 year old really got in to the interactive part even though the trail itself doesn’t have much for experienced hikers (with kids, hiking is not about the miles it’s about the smiles!). Heard and saw lots of birds, so this could be a good one for birding. We couldn’t find the millstone, maybe ask a Ranger for tips before you go for that one."

The rangers are knowledgeable about everything you can imagine...which hike you would enjoy most, the weather forecast, where to see wildlife, etc.  They lead a number of very good programs, some about the science in the park and some about the history of the park.  The rangers are wonderful with kids and make it fun to become a junior ranger.  Check out the ranger-led programs and take advantage of this fantastic resource available to you.

One can always tell when they are on the well maintained and marked Appalachian Trail by the white blazes or the stylized white AT on trail markers versus the blue blazes of the park’s trails or the yellow blazes of the horse trails.

I would rate the difficulty level at moderate.

Super rewarding, excellent views, and really fun. Would definitely recommend going as early as possible. Me and my sister got there at 4:30am on a Saturday and half of the main parking lot was full. 4:30am-5:00am is most likely the best time to go because there were no lines, and comfortable room between hikers. We got passed a couple times as well as passing others but it was nothing crazy. Bring AT LEAST 2 liters of water. It’s a long hike so you are 100% going to need it. Me and my sister aren’t particularly in shape and completed the rock scramble w no problem (just lots of breaks). There are LOTS of narrow sections while bouldering so things will get increasingly harder for you the wider you are and you may have to be creative to finish."

There is a reservation system in place for this hike.  Unfortunately, there were people in line ahead of us who made the drive and were unaware that reservations were required.  It is a nominal charge for the advance reservation.  From the trailhead, the hike climbed quickly which definitely earned it the rating of strenuous.  A lot of reviews discussed the danger of the rock scramble that hikers reach at about the 2.5 mile mark.  This is not a climb, but a scramble.  It is a little adventure around each corner.  Take your time and enjoy the scenery!"

We arrived at the Old Rag Parking lot at 8 AM to give us enough time to get up the mountain. We thought that the beginning of the hike was  pretty hard because it was an incline up over small rocks. When we reached the rock scramble we took our time and had a lot of fun! I think that the rocks scramble and the summit were everyone's favorite parts of the hike. We made it to the top at around 12:30 PM since we took a lot of breaks. We stayed at the top for a while and enjoyed the splendid view, then made our way down the other side. For us the trip down was the hardest, since it was the longest stretch and there were more gravel and rocks than on the way up. We ended the trail at around 4 PM."

I left my Old Rag passes on my dashboard and the NP pass hanging from my rear view mirror because the lot didn’t have anyone there to check for the passes.  There was a Park Ranger checking for our Old Rag passes at the start of the loop about 0.8 miles from the parking area. We had two kids ages 9 & 10 with us.  We packed lots of water, sandwiches, snacks.  It was a great hike for all of us. It wasn’t crowded, only 1 short holdup to wait for someone to figure out how to get up one section of scramble. The kids were just big enough (tall & strong enough) to handle the scrambling with almost no assistance.  Doing the loop from Berry Hollow allowed us to start & end on a woods road.  The water sources were not really where we might have needed them, early and late in the hike (we always carry a water filter)."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Old Rag Mountain Hike,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best of Shenandoah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I googled Old Rag, and found a staged pic of craziness showing the “Leap of Faith” along the Ridge Trail. Given that I’m 68 and was hiking solo, I took the backside Berry Hollow Trail. It’s a beautiful trail in itself, winding through the forest and boulders with switchbacks and vistas. And everyone ends up at the same summit. The summit itself and its vistas on a clear day can’t be matched on the East Coast. The NPS description said to plan for 7 hrs but even with lunch and taking lots of photos, it only took only 5. Having now seen the Ridge Trail pics on this site, I’m game for going back solo and tackling it. This was flat out wonderful."

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Hawksbill Mountain,Mountains,5.0,The Eyrie of Shenandoah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing view with great picture opportunities at the top! I suggest hiking the Hawksbill Summit Loop route to the top.  This loop is 2.9 miles roundtrip and you’ll gain about ~850 feet in elevation.

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Hawksbill Mountain,Mountains,5.0,An easy route to the view exists,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hawksbill is one of the trails, at its viewpoint, where you can get a wide view of the mountains and valleys.  It is listed as the highest point in the park, and the view west is nice, but if you study the trails there are other opportunities for a similar view.  It just depends on where you are staying, how much time you have, and how much you want to hike.  You can reach Hawksbill overview two ways.  The longer and more difficult route starts at Hawksbill Gap parking.  The shorter and easier route begins at the Upper Hawksbill parking lot.  The trail is wide and, although it gains elevation, not too steep.  Unlike a number of Shenandoah trails, Hawksbill from the upper lot is not strewn with uneven rocky footing.  When you reach the top there is a prominent rock formation that offers spots to relax and take in the view."

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Mary's Rock Summit Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Don’t Fall for Mary’s Rock Summit Hike - Alternate,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Entering at Thornton Gap, we were eager to take our first post COVID hike; seeing two options for the Mary’s Rock Summit Trail, one 3.7 miles (6.0k) with 1,250-foot (381m) elevation gain and the other, designated as the “alternate”, 2.9 miles (4.7k) round trip with a 830-foot (253m) elevation gain, we decided to be conservative and chose the latter for our first leg stretcher in over a year and a half.  The only problem was that the alternate summit trail does not take you to the summit or even any view at all!  It ends at an AT camping shelter in a clearing in the woods.  While the hike is not terrible as it peacefully passes through the woods were we saw deer, wildflowers and a few springs, with so many other excellent hikes in Shenandoah to waterfalls or great views, we were disappointed in spending our time on this trail with a misleading name."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Mary's Rock Summit Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Great hike, but stressful due to coronavirus",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The trail is lovely and the views at the top are gorgeous. A good 2-3 hour hike of moderate difficulty. But, it was pretty stressful because there are a large number of people on the trail and many if not most are not wearing masks, nor are they keeping a safe distance. The trail is narrow and so you are crossing paths constantly with people breathing hard and heavy without masks on a foot or two away. And the area at the top is really small - so there were just a lot of people trying to share a relatively small space. If you are concerned about coronavirus and following public health guidance, this trail (and most trails in along the Blue Ridge) will really stress you out as it did us."

Took about 3.25 hours, and we stopped at the top to take in the views and have lunch."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Mary's Rock Summit Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great First Hike in Shenandoah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I started at the Panorama parking lot; it was much harder going up than coming down.  Next time I’ll bring my hiking poles.  Took me ~ 3.5 hours well worth the effort though.
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Mary's Rock Summit Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Tips for hiking Mary's Rock trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great trail for a day hike.  A few tips:  Unless things have changed recently, you can park at the trailhead without a park permit.  To do so, you pass under the Skyline Drive bridge on US 211 (coming from Washington) and turn left directly into the parking lot just at the summit of Thornton Gap.  (The Panorama restaurant used to be here, which is why this entrance to the parking lot remains.)   Second, when you get to the big overlook at what appears to be the top of the trail, you have not yet reached Mary's Rock.  The rock is located along the ridge about 75 yards south of the overlook.  To get there requires a bit of a rock scramble along the ridge.   You'll find a trail of sorts at the base of the rock outcrop.  Keep the rocks on the right and you will eventually come to Mary's Rock.  To make the final 10 foot ascent requires a bit of climbing but can be done without equipment.  The actual rock has room for only a couple of people at a time.  You'll know when you get there because there is a USGS marker on top of the rock.  From there, you get a 360 degree view.   Finally, I'd recommend going in June, when the Mountain Laurel are in bloom."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Mary's Rock Summit Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,What a payoff!  Gorgeous views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took this hike in the late afternoon.  It was 1.8 miles to the summit, so 3.6 miles round trip.  It took us almost two hours to reach the top, but less than one hour to hike back down.  It is absolutely uphill all the way to the summit.  Coming home is easy!  We had a six year old and a nine year old, and they handled it fine.  The terrain is very rocky in places.  This is not a nice, wide, smoothed path; if you have any troubles keeping your footing, I wouldn't try it.  The summit provides a tremendous view of valleys in three directions.  You can scramble over some boulders to the very top, but there are precipitous drops on both sides, so keep a CLOSE eye on children at the summit.  There is a restroom facility with a big parking lot at the base of the trail.  This is accessible off the 211 (just west of Skyline Drive), on the south side of 211.  The turn is not well signed, but it is immediately next to Skyline Drive.  This saves you from having to pay the Shenandoah National Park fee.  Impressively clean hike; I saw no trash at all."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Mary's Rock Summit Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Incredible views for a moderate hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The park rangers will tell you to start this hike at the Panorama parking, next to the entrance at Rt. 211. DON'T! Longer, steeper. Instead, ask them how to access the trail from a parking area 3 miles or so south. 2.8 miles R/T "
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Mary's Rock Summit Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Loved this medium hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Accessed trail off of rt 211 across from Skyline Drive entrance.  There are no signs for this area to park and it has a nice parking area and very nice bathrooms with information etc.  The hike is 3.7 miles roundtrip.  You can do it wearing sneakers, but you have to watch the trail carefully all the time so as to not twist an ankle. I recommend some ""light"" hiking shoes.  It's a medium difficulty and some nice views going up.  It's pretty much shaded the whole way.  The top has excellent views and places to relax and have a bite to eat.  We had a great day to hike (74 degrees at start) and at the top it was cool.  The visibility was around 40 miles.  Bring water as the uphill climb will make you sweat (I typically do not sweat much at all, even when exercising hard).   The return trip was enjoyable."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Dark Hollow Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Crowded,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I took this hike while visiting Shenandoah. There was a lot of cars around it, but I did not think it would be as crowded as it was. Some were wearing masks, but there was minimal social distancing. The waterfalls were nice, but it was hard to get good pictures without people in them. The walk down was fairly easy, though I did slip on a rock once. The hike up, as they do warn, is challenging."

It was beautiful.  The hike is all down hill going and uphill return.  Not for beginners. Seems to attract a lot of visitors.  Small amount of parking.  Worth the hike."

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Dark Hollow Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Crowded Hike by the Bubbling Brook,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our favorite hike while we were at Shenandoah, as the trail offered many opportunities to sit next to a calming brook as it descended the mountain and eventually went over a stunning set of falls in the forest.  The hike was enough to break a sweat, and you should be careful not to lose your footing on the sometimes slippery rocks, but the payoff at the falls was worth the hike down and back up."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Dark Hollow Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,"Lovely trail, along the bubbling waters al the way through!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Was a lovely trail all the way. We had two kids 6 and 3. Having read some of the reviews I was concerned that the hike back up was going to be challenging with the three year old but it was not. You just need to go easy and carry just the minimum essentials. The kids enjoyed dipping gather feet in the icy water, sitting on the rocks watching the waters cascading down. There are quite a few places where you can actually get into knee deep water. Some sections of the trail are wet and slippery so good footwear is a must. Those were the only sections over which we had to carry out 3 year old. "

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Dark Hollow Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Best waterfall hike in the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did Dark Hollow, Rose River, Lewis Falls, and Whiteoak Canyon. Dark Hollow is the best one. The path is steep in places. Wear good shoes, not sandals. Water and a snack are also good to bring along. If you've got the time,  do the whole trail. Many people stopped at the first waterfall and then went back to the parking area. All three cascades are lovely. The walk back is uphill but if you take your time, it's doable. "

It’s quite a ways down, we drank a full 16 ounces of water and a 12 ounce gatorade. Lots of folks with not good shoes, wear hikers or at least sneakers. Flip flops, crocs, tiny dogs in purses and toddlers in flip flops or crocs (or stroller!) will have a very hard to impossible time on this trail.  It was muddy, slippery and very rocky in places with a steep incline. We passed a couple of skinned up knees and elbows and inhappy tears."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Dark Hollow Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Beautiful scenery ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We enjoyed the trail. It was hard to go back because it was up hill on the way back, but it was beautiful and easy to walk. Not too crowded when we went because it rained for a bit that day. Easy to find parking, since the park is organized and has parking and areas to stop for pictures. The waterfall itself was gorgeous and totally worth the 20 min walk each way. Some people were even bathing. We had young kids and we had to carry them on the way back, so if a parent can’t carry their kid, It will probably take more then 20 min to go back. "
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Dark Hollow Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Nice water fall,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dark Hallow Falls is a beautiful hike to a really nice water fall. It's about a mile and a half hike downhill to the falls. (And uphill on the way back). It can be pretty crowded on weekends. Parking can be a problem.

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Bearfence Mountain,Mountains,4.5,My favorite Shenandoah hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike is ~1.25 miles roundtrip and gains ~300 feet of elevation.  You’ll be climbing up and around all sorts of boulders as you make your way to the summit. The trail is well marked with blue blazes. This is my favorite hike in the national park and offers spectacular views/photo opportunities; however, I would not recommend it for those unsteady on their feet or for families with young children and/or pets."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Bearfence Mountain,Mountains,4.5,"Amazing View, fun hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Easy trail with great beginner rock scramble. Nothing scary. Our kids 13,12 and 9 did it easily following the pack. My husband had no issue completing it with our 3 year old in the baby carrier (but I swear he is part billy goat). I am not in shape by any means and had no issues. I tend to be afraid of heights but compared to other hikes we have done this one did not bother me. I would not do this hike in wet weather."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Bearfence Mountain,Mountains,4.5,Great Stretch Your Legs Trail. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is not a long trail, the parking fills early as this trail is popular right off Skyline drive. You can choose either the rock scramble or the bypass. Pay attention to the trail markings, the scramble is well marked. Always watch where you place your hands as this is timber rattler habitat. You are rewarded with magnificent views at the top. Well worth taking the time to do this trail."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Bearfence Mountain,Mountains,4.5,Definitely a Worthwhile Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I loved the Bearfence rock scramble. We are not regular hikers since we hail from flat lands. However, we are rather active people, and it was a workout for us. Climbing up and down the rocks was a whole lot of fun, and the view were astounding. It took us a little over an hour to hike. We went up the rock scramble and came back on the Appalachian trail. It was a fun hike that was challenging but not overly difficult. This hike is not a vertical rock climb. There are no ropes or chains, but you do have to scramble up and down some rocks. If considering this hike, one should realize that you need to use your whole body, have good balance, and be okay with moderate heights.  It is certainly doable and certainly worth doing! Bring water and good shoes too."
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Bearfence Mountain,Mountains,4.5,Rock Scramble to be King of the Mountain,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was one of my favorite hikes - but be prepared for the rock scramble at the end.  It will involve careful maneuvering up crevices and over large gaps, with steep drop offs on either side. You will need both feet and hands at times to get yourself up the rocks to the top, but its a fun exercise and worth the trip to the windswept peak, with 360 degree views. Its a strenuous, but short hike. "
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Bearfence Mountain,Mountains,4.5,"This is ""a bear"" of a hike",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the hike if you want to put away the poles and use more of your body.  The guides call is a ""scramble"", which turns out to mean that you have to go over and around boulders and escarpments to reach the end of the trail.  Fair warning, it is such a popular hike that attracts crowds, but there are some that maybe should cross it off the list.  I found that my balance was not what it once was and it took me a long time and a lot of effort to traverse the trail.  All the while younger and more physically able (there I admitted it) climbers provided encouragement (I could see that it could be done) or discouragement (I can't do that).  I will also admit that climbing up, with my challenged balance, caused a bit of anxiety on the higher portions of the scramble.  All in all, I wouldn't try it again.  There are so many hikes in the park, all with a view as scenic as the denouement of the Bearfence Trail, that the payoff wasn't there for me."

Forget your hiking poles and bring your gloves.  We did this on Thursday, October 14.  Got to the scrambling part of the trail and thought the views were just OK.  Maybe if the fall foliage was popping, it would have been a better experience. "
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Bearfence Mountain,Mountains,4.5,Difficult Rock Scramble,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Tried the rock scramble with two 9 yr olds to make the hike more interesting. Most of it was challenging but doable. There is one spot where the step up was 3 to 4 feet with an exposed drop off of over 100 feet. We chose to go back. Would be nice if they had a bypass trail for this who aren’t able to do some or all of the rock scramble without having to go back around via the Appalachian Trail. 
Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Bearfence Mountain,Mountains,4.5,Rock Scramble,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We were visiting Shenandoah National Park and decided to try this trail. There was a parking lot across the road which made it easy to get to the trail. There is an easier trail on the path and a harder trail with a rock scramble. We chose to do the rock scramble. The path was easy to follow on the rocks as it was marked with blue paint. I am short and some spots were a struggle for me to get up to climb over the rocks but I got thru it. The view on the rock scramble was my favorite part. We really enjoyed this hike!

Our first trip to Shenandoah National Park and we loved it! Would love to come back to hike to some falls and maybe camp. The Skyland visitors center parking lot was being repaved and no room for anyone else to park, so we weren't able to stop there. Seemed busy enough for a weekday, but not overly crowded at all. "

While the views, park design and pretty much everything else was excellent, our precious time together was almost ruined by the 100 or so young motor heads who were marauding though the park in their low, high end sports cars. They were not there to hike or site see but rather to be as loud, obnoxious, intimidating and unsafe as possible: tail gating, speeding, laying rubber, passing in non passing zones. There was not a park ranger in site so they were free to just do their unrelenting marauding through the north section of the park. I called Shenendoah NP about this - left a very terse and specific voice message with them asking them to call me back and also e-mailed but I was ignored on both fronts. I'm shocked that they let them in in the first place, stunned there was no ranger presence and shocked that they ignored my contacts. Wow how so very disappointed!!!!"

Shenandoah National Park,Virginia (VA),Skyline Drive,Bodies of Water,4.5,Unforgettable for fall foliage,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Every year in September and October, throngs of visitors from DC metro and other states come to the Skyline drive for enjoying the fabulous fall colors. The peak would be last week of October for most years. Expect a big line at the entrance as money changes hands for the parking fee to be given to Uncle Sam. The fees have gone up a lot in the last 10 years. The drive, few hours long, rewards the visitors with red, crimson, gold, yellow, violet, pink, did I miss any other, colored leaves straight out of a giant dreamlike poster photograph. There are turnouts where one can stop and take as many pictures as one likes with an iphone or the most expensive DSLR available. Whats more, if you are ready to drive further south, Blue Ridge Parkway awaits with even more majestic views. Oh yes, there are restaurants on the way, so taking a break is easy too. Shenandoah mountain in Fall is rated a top attraction in the entire region. If you are going on weekends in October, arrive very early, as we were turned back by the rangers going around noon."

I could have sat for a long time at each overlook and taken in the beauty and the peacefulness--we actually saw several people doing just that. We enjoyed the drive very much and would highly recommend this scenic drive. I wish we had had the time to do some of the hikes as there appear to be several that are not too difficult, but which are quite spectacular. I did note several things."

From our accommodations outside Luray we entered the national park both at the north end as well as via Thornton Gap. We were never up early enough to savor the views at dawn but we had a couple of spectacular sunsets. Dining opportunities are few on Skyline. We had a late lunch at Skyland on one day. On the other we bought snacks and drinks at Elkwallow at the northern part of the drive.

Look for Roaring River Falls, Zumwalt's Meadow.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Byway largely travels through the Sequoia National Forest, only entering Kings Canyon the last one third of the drive.  Follows the Kings River, visible most of the way.  Grizzly Falls, right on the road as a turnout, is a highlight of the drive.   Can seem maddingly slow if you are anxious to reach Cedar Grove, but actually a better road than Generals Highway in Sequoia NP to the south.   In addition to Grizzly, which is in the Forest, there are scenic or noteworthy turnouts closer to Cedar Grove.  Roaring River Falls, past Cedar Grove, is the most scenic of all falls in the park, with the parking lot on the Byway and a short paved walk to the falls.  Road ends at trail to Mist Falls, with Zumwalt's Meadow a beautiful, serene greenspace and easy walk along the way."

As long as you don't approach the cubs or make loud noise, the bears will leave you alone. The highlight of our Sequoia vacation."

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Crescent Meadow Loop,Hiking Trails,4.5,Easy hike & best photos,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a simple, relatively level hike with lots of great scenery. Parking is close to the trail head, and the trail is paved far enough to see Crescent Meadow (which is really more of a lush, green swamp). After that, the loop is a dirt trail that circles the meadow and passes by a number of incredible living Sequoias, as well as Tharp's Log and Chimney Tree. We stopped for a picnic lunch at Tharp's Log, and only saw three other people during our time there (this was a Sunday afternoon).  We found Chimney Tree less impressive than the apparently unnamed tree nearby, which fell down ages ago and now lies in huge segments that go on and on. The trail continues around the far side of Crescent Meadow and leads back to the parking area, where there is a shady picnic area and bathroom facilities (no running water, just pit toilets)."

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Boyden Cavern,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Worth the drive!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a bit of a curvy drive from Three Rivers but totally worth it in my opinion. It’s not everyday you get to explore a crystal cave. It was very easy to find and the check in process was smooth. I suggest wearing closed toe shoes. Our tour guide Ely was fantastic! He made it humorous while providing interesting facts about the cave and its history. He is clearly very passionate about his job and that’s hard to find nowadays. I would highly recommend Boyden Caverns as I’ve toured other caves and this one is right up there with the rest. Thank you Ely!
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Boyden Cavern,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Wonderful experience and perfect for kids!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I am SO glad we were able to book this tour during our recent visit. At first I was apprehensive just because with COVID, we feel more comfortable avoiding anything indoors, but we felt so safe and would have really missed out if we had cancelled. They are taking one tour group at a time and also sanitizing railings upon exiting the cave. Masks are also required on the tour. Stella was our tour guide and she was wonderful, especially with our kids (ages 5 & 8). The tour is the perfect length of an hour and make sure you check the website so you can be prepared to take the Wild Cave exit where you get your feet a bit wet. Our kids thought this was the best experience of our entire trip. I have been to many caverns before, including Mammoth Cave. Even though this is a smaller cavern in comparison, it is still very much worth the time. We loved it!"

We made a reservation online for 12pm, we got there early to make sure we got parking, use the restroom and to check in. The attendant at the register asked if we'd like to take the 1130am tour instead, of coarse we did. Exactly 1130am they called our group of 29 people and started to send us up the path. The path was a little steep but it was a short walk. Made us hot, that when we went into the cavern it felt really nice and cold. It felt good! Our favorite parts of the cavern was seeing the Christmas and the wedding cake.  My kids loved the blackout and the idea that we may go back before the season ends to camp in there. Lol.  I love that they let us take all the pictures we want and video. They're knowledge of everything seemed legit. We will definitely recommend this small tour of the Boyden caverns to anyone heading out that way."
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Boyden Cavern,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Wonderful experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Visited the cave on a hot summer day, so take your time going up the steep ramp to the cave (the view of the river from the top of ramp were lovely!). Once in the cave area, you can immediately feel the refreshing temperature s from inside the cave; a nice reprieve from the outside temps. Our guide was amazing! Due to the dry conditions this year, we weren't able to see or hear the water gurgling through the bottom of the cave or on the adventure exit. They also did a lights out portion of the tour which was cool! The tour was short but definitely worth the money! Will be going back again."
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Boyden Cavern,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Loved it!!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I don’t know how people can say they didn’t like this tour. I loved it. Stella was our guide and she was amazing, fun, informative. Due to COVID all tours are given with just your group - which is awesome. We had a private, intimate tour and the cavern was really really cool. Especially the ending when we exited thru the creek in the Cavern. I’ve done the Crystal Caverns 2 years ago (it’s closed now bc of COVID) and while that was neat , the hike to the caverns was pretty strenuous and the tour much more sterile. You followed along a concrete foot path. With this tour, some was concreted, some not and you really felt as if you were on an expedition discovering something new. The hike up to the Cavern entrance, while initially daunting to look at, wasnt that bad (Crystal Caverns was far worse). I wouldn’t recommend this tour for families with little kids bc there are areas where I can see them tripping or falling and there is quite a bit of ducking involved. Also given some of the areas we had to squeeze thru , I also wouldn’t recommend this for anyone very heavy. All in all, I highly recommend and this is a definite must do if you’re heading into Kings Canyon. "

My family (husband and 2 children ages 6 and 11) were greeted by the most hospitable Park ranger type woman in a small shack where we checked in. The shack that sold waters and snacks which we bought and we paid with a card, not sure if that machine always works but it did that day. To get to the cavern you travel up a very steep hill for about 5 minutes and that was a lot of fun for the kids! At the entrance we were greeted by our guide and she was spectacular! She got to know our family and made a lot of food related themed jokes along the tour as if the formations resembled cakes and chicken legs. We learned a lot about the history of the cavern. Sitting in the very dark was a really cool experience as well. A highlight was walking through the creek which is optional at the end of the tour. I would definitely wear water shoes or some sort of strappy water sandal  (that’s what we had on for this very reason)   The creek was so cold but walking through the cave as if it were wild was totally worth the freezing feet!

It features stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstone, pendants, and shields.  It is located in the Sequoia National Forest.  It was a steep walk leading to the entrance.  The view from the top towards the entrance was spectacular.  The tour guide mentioned that it closes mid-October through winter.  We made a reservation ahead of time which was highly recommended.  It was 2 days after Labor Day, and there were only 8 of us on the tour.  According to the guide, he had more than 40 per tour during Labor Day weekend."
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Boyden Cavern,Caverns & Caves,5.0,Wild Cave Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great up close and personal cave experience. The steep walk to entrance cave is no joke. Unfortunately we had to get a refund for my older parents as they could not make the walk up. I would say the cave is great for families but hang on to small kids hands as there are low railings. There are spots you must duck under and several spots to squeeze through and might be hard for the elderly or those on the plus size. Even if my parents could have made the walk up they would have had a very hard time squeezing through the openings so just beware. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and taking the walk out through the water exit was definitely fun. Wear water shoes or shoes that can get wet and just be careful of the rocks. It was a great experience and I would highly recommend.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Congress Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Do not miss the Congress Trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is accessible from the path to the General Sherman tree.  If you make it to see the Sherman, do yourself a favor, and spend another 30 to 60 minutes to walk in the grove and see the adjacent giant Sequoias, including those on the Congress Trail.  The walk among these trees is fairly easy and not strenuous.  If camping in nearby Lodgepole, take the free shuttle to the General Sherman upper parking lot.  After seeing the General Sherman tree and walking through the Congress Trail, you can pick up your ride back to camp at the lower parking lot at General Sherman."
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Congress Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,A Must Do if You Are Able,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We parked at General Sherman Tree parking lot. From there, the paved trail heads downward, with some few steps. The Congress Trail is well signed and you reach the turnoff just before the General Sherman Tree, which is just a tad beyond. We checked out that tree then headed out on Congress trail, which is also paved and has a bit more elevation gain. The trees here are stunning, truly awe inspiring. I found the plentiful evidence of fire damage to be, well, humbling and soulful. This trail is a pure jewel. It loops around, back to Sherman, and by then, gotta say, uphill to the parking lot was a bit of an effort. We entered Congress at9:30am, mid week. When we arrived back to Sherman, there were lines of people to take pictures.  "

Maybe the largest collection of the biggest trees in the park (including General Sherman nearby). Easy access from the shuttle stop. In addition to Sherman, saw several others in the Top 20 including the President tree (equally as impressive as GS IMO), Chief, Lincoln, Washington Tree (not technically on the CT) and several amazing stands labeled The Senate and The House. Much of this trail is paved and a gently elevation gain that most people physically should be able to conquer. If you are only up for a few miles and have physically limitations.. do this one!"
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Congress Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Overshadowed by Grant and Sherman but combine with Sherman Trail for lots of interesting trees,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Admittedly the General Sherman and General Grant trees and their trails take top billing, and deservedly so.  But if you want to avoid those crowds and still want to see numerous examples of the prime specimens, the NPS has done a good job of making the trees, or groups of trees, noticeable among their peers with special mark and signage along the trail.  A paved and easy trail, can be taken off the Sherman Tree Trail, so you can combine both and still not have a moderate walk at most."

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Congress Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Best Area for Lots of Giant Sequoias!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Parking for this trail is at the Sherman Tree Parking area (restrooms available here), off of Wolverton Rd (off of Generals Hwy).  We visited the General Sherman Tree (Wow!) first and then continued onto the Congress Trail.  The “Giant Forest Trail Map” we had purchased ($3.50) earlier at a visitor center was extremely helpful for this area of the park with all its many intersecting paths.  There had been a snow storm 2 days before and the Congress Trail was covered with snow/ice/slush.  We were glad to have our trekking poles with us for this hike.  We had to walk slower than usual to watch carefully where we placed our feet.  The Congress Trail was Great as it was so nice and quiet we felt like we had it all to ourselves - maybe because we started fairly early at 8:35 a.m. from parking area.  In addition to the Congress Trail we hiked a bit extra on the Alta Trail to see the Lincoln Tree (route is shown on the purchased map). That was well worth the extra effort as you can stand inside the open base of this grand sequoia tree.  The parking area was much more crowded when we returned at 11:05 a.m.  We spent 2 hours and 30 minutes total hiking in this area, but we hiked slower than usual due to the condition of the trails.  We felt this area of the park had the best concentration of giant sequoias.  If you only have time for one hike to see giant sequoias, be sure to do this one."

We then go to General Sherman tree trail, afterwards, we drove along the General highway to the Kings Canyon national park, there are some overlooks in the Kings canyon portions.

Maybe it was pretty, but I had my eyes shut half the time. There were certainly a few very pretty vista points, but it just truly felt like it took forever to get to Sequoia. The drive back down at night was much better for me bc I was not on scary side and couldn't see the drop offs nearly as well. I guess I should say 180 as a whole and not just the highway was scary and very long and winding. It was almost instant motion sickness as I read about so I came prepared and gave us and the kids gum, which helps mitigate that issue. So glad we skipped the Twin Cities route, which is said to be even worse. It was mainly the length of this road and 180 that was tiring. Saw a very unique and beautiful red colored sunset over city lights on our way down on 180, leaving Kings Canyon though. "

It is a beautiful drive and we did get to see a couple of interesting places like Tunnel Rock and Hospital Rock.  The Kaweah River was flowing very swiftly because of all the snow melt.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Generals Highway,Scenic Drives,4.5,A Long and Winding Road,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The General’s Highway is the main (and only) paved road running through Sequoia National Park from the north to south entrances.  It is roughly 50 miles from the south entrance to the road junction leading to the north entrance/exit (which is actually in King’s Canyon National Park).  The road passes through the Giant Forest, the largest concentration of Giant Sequoias, passes close to the General Sherman tree, the Lodgepole area, and Wuksachi Lodge.  There is a parking area another 10 miles or so north of Wuksachi where many Sequoias are right by the roadway.  It is a beautiful drive in good weather but slow, especially when there is much traffic.  Opportunities to pass are few and far between, and the road is so winding you can’t go fast in any case; although going slow and enjoying the scenery is a plus.  The road is in reasonably good shape from the south entrance to the Wuksachi Lodge (roughly halfway), and for about another 5 miles north until you reach the Little Baldy Saddle.  North of this spot the road deteriorates significantly.  You are in for a bumpy ride from this point to the north entrance, and a painful one if you have back problems.  Also, there is no gasoline available in the park.  There is a self-serve gas station at Stoney Creek Lodge 12 miles north of the Wuksachi Lodge in the Sequoia National Forest.  I don’t know if it is open all the time.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are available at The Peaks restaurant at the Wuksachi Lodge, and they also provide box lunches.  Food is also available in more of a fast food setting at Lodgepole but they are only open during the season – this place was closed when we visited in mid-October.  Food may also be available about 15 miles north at the Stoney Creek Lodge on the Sequoia National Forest.  Otherwise you will have to drive to Grant’s Grove in King’s Canyon NP to the next restaurant (25 miles north of Wuksachi)."

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Kings Canyon,National Parks,4.5,Don’t miss Zumwalt Meadow in King’s Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited Sequoia, King’s Canyon and Yosemite - and loved all 3- but the highlight of the trip was the stunning drive down King’s Canyon scenic byway that was punctuated by our favorite hike at Zumwalt Meadow.  Zumwalt was magical due to the combination of an area of the river at the start of the trail that was protected and Allowed you to have a small swim, followed by a short lovely hike through the forest to a wooden bridge where you can cross the river with stunning views. Then you get to the meadow with a wooden path to cross over and the view of the meadow and the tall steep mountains that surround it is just breathtaking.  You feel like you are surrounded by the Dolomite mountains. We walked just a bit further through the meadow until we reached the river and on our wAy saw a family of 5 deer.  We turned around there and went back after just about 20-30 min of walking.  Perfect and not strenuous, so the kids enjoyed it as well"
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Kings Canyon,National Parks,4.5,"Amazing walk, must do for everyone",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The walk starts with 900 steps straight up, which if your not fit like me, was quite difficult, but with a couple of little stops (there’s a seat half way up) it was manageable. Once up top it was fairly flat & there are arrows leading the way, so you don’t get lost. "

Lots of wildlife including bear encounters as well as mother / cubs too. Keep your distance. but wonderful opportunity. I prefer to do the river walk right from roaring river falls up to Bubbs creek.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Kings Canyon,National Parks,4.5,Gateway to Sequoia NP but still worth a visit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Some of the points of interest are currently inaccessible so there’s not a ton to do inside KCNP. It’s currently the main gateway to Sequoia NP, so it’s still worth a visit. The KCNP passport stamp is available only at the KC Visitors center; there are 2 pressed penny machines in the Grant Grove village, which is adjacent to the park visitors center and store. The General Grant Tree & Grove are really worth a visit. The scenic byway was closed, so we only got to visit the northwest section of the park. There isn’t a big area to pull off for a picture with the entrance sign; there’s a small pull-off area on the exiting side."

You see several large trees on the hike.  There really was not a lot to see due to the road being closed to the canyon itself.  The drive is beautiful, and we did see a bear while there.  It is connected to Sequoia National Park, so go through it.  Actually, you have to drive through it to get to Sequoia National Park since the south road into Sequoia is closed also."

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Giant Forest,Forests,5.0,Uncontrolled chaos,2.0 of 5 bubbles,We have been going to Sequoia/ Kings Canyon for many years. The crowds have been becoming worse every year. There is no attempt to control how many people come into the park. As a result on a recent trip we were unable to view the beautiful trees that we have seen in the past. There were cars parked in the traffic lanes in the area of Giant Forest causing cars to drive down the middle of generals Hwy. No rangers were ever seen. Even though there was little snow the parking lot for the General Sherman was not available.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Giant Forest,Forests,5.0,The Biggest Grove and the Biggest Trees,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes there are other groves of Sequoias, but this is biggest grove with the biggest and tallest Sequoias anywhere.  From the minute you crest the top of the mountain up hill section to the General Sherman tree, you will drive a couple of miles through the most amazing forest anywhere.  There are several trails here like Big Trees Trail and Congress Trail and even the trail to the General Sherman tree, the biggest tree in the world.  However, just the drive alone is magical.  This is why it is my wife's favorite National Park.  There simply nowhere where you can have this time of prehistoric experience, walking among massive trees that are 2,500 year old.  I will say that while the recent forest fires have not impacted the sequoias they have altered the forest compared to what I saw 10 years ago.  So many of the pines and firs are gone.  Still it is the sequoias make this an incredible MUST SEE."

Returned the next day for a short walk to Beetle Rock and around Round Meadow. All easy trails with much of it doable even for folks with physical limitations.

These two national parks are the second old in the national park system and lie side by side in the southern Sierra Nevada. After a hardy lunch at Salty’s BBQ (see review below), we entered Sequoia via CA 198. We had planned our trip to this park in the afternoon because we wanted to enjoy the breathtaking views of the trees, mountains and valleys at sunset during our drive to Fresno. I highly recommend this.  "
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Giant Forest,Forests,5.0,A great gigantic place!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The giant forest with the giant sequioa trees is a sight to behold.

It is also great to know Interesting facts about them too.
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Giant Forest,Forests,5.0,Review of Sequoia National Park,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We're Brits and we found the Sequoia National Park website extremely unhelpful so hopefully this review  will be useful! If you want a few days of big trees then the Sequoia bit of the park is plenty. You won't make it to the King's Canyon or the other bits unless you’ve got more time - the distances are too great and the routes too inaccessible because of the altitude. Once you've picked that bit of the park, the route in and also out is from the village of Three Rivers. There are lots of motels here but they are a good 90 minutes' drive from the park proper. Inside the park you can either camp (we didn't) or stay at Wuksachi Lodge, which has a restaurant. Booking directly was much more expensive than using Expedia in our experience. The lodge is 7000 feet up and surrounded by beautiful forest. It takes a good hour to reach it by car from the entrance to the park because the road is so steep. It costs 20 dollars to enter the park or else you can get an annual pass covering all the national parks for 80 dollars. I thoroughly recommend Wuksachi Lodge. It is a great base to explore the various walking trails round about and the staff will give you maps for trails of different lengths and difficulties. You will need a car to get to many of these interesting sites, but you're only looking at a ten minute drive each time. Slightly further down the mountain is a shop for the campers stocking many more gifts and lots of food items. The Sherman tree is also nearby. The car parks at each of these sorts of sites have basic toilets (bring your own hand sanitiser!) and bear lockers for food. There’s no cafe in the park though which is surely something the National Trust would remedy in no time! We went in late April 2014 and we really couldn’t tell from online information what type of weather to expect. For most of the winter everything is covered in snow and you need chains on your car but apparently this year wasn’t very bad for snow so there was only the odd patch of densely packed snow under the trees here and there. The roads were completely clear. The temperature was near freezing in the early morning but there was blazing sunshine by the afternoon, probably up to about 20 C. We were expecting to need cold weather coats and shoes but we didn’t at all. We may have just got lucky though."
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Giant Forest,Forests,5.0,It was ok,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"First of all, I'd like to let people know things that no one else wrote about. Once you pay your fee ($30 per car), there is a 17 mile almost the whole way there all winding road ( at 25mph) to where most activities are. So if you are prone to motion sickness do yourself a favor and prepare for this. There was about a 10 minute wait to even get to the entrance. Also, there is currently construction on the main road and in one area a one lane road where we waited 8 minutes for a light to change. Once we arrived to the area of general Sherman tree parking area there was no parking spots, so we were forced to create our own.  Also, I checked ahead of time online to see if dogs are allowed, we got to the hiking trail only to find out pets are NOT allowed on ANY trails. Lovely, this would have been a great fact to know PRIOR to spending 4 hours getting there.  The trail was well kept and the tree was nice to see. Be prepared to add about an hour to your journey due to lines, construction and winding roads."
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Moro Rock Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Views for days,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is something you should put on your list, the view from the top is breathtaking. I got there first thing in the morning trying to beat the crowds and I succeeded as I encounter some people but it was manageable. Keep in mind parking is limited unless you are planning to hike from the Giant Forest museum. It's 350 steps to get to the top and it's steep and narrow. Some places only one person can pass through at a time. At the top you can get the most amazing pictures and videos but it still wouldn't do it justice. Not recommended for people who are afraid of heights. There are bathrooms at the head of the trail. Watch your step going up and down. Enjoy!"
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Moro Rock Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Skip the trail and park at the top for the rock.  Not for those with height anxiety.  And only on a low pollution day.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Trail, not just the rock, leads from the Forest Museum to the rock and is a uphill slog.  You can turn that around by starting at the rock and walking the Moro Rock Trail down to the museum.  The trail is poorly marked at the top and not particularly noteworthy given the many options in the park.  HOWEVER, Moro Rock is unique and worth the time.  A small parking lot at the top of the trail eliminates all but a short walk up the 350+ stairway on the rock.  However, I have a fear of heights and only made it, and I counted, 320 steps up the stairway.  The combination of a short railing and windy day accentuated my anxiety.  And I can tell you, from being in the park seven days and getting up 320 steps, there is no view to admire when the pollution covers the nearby mountains and fills the valleys - as it did for our entire visit."

I had read reviews about it before I went. I imagined it as a small rock hike with a view. Didn't realize it will be this awesome. Not to be missed in this park. Moro rock hike was the best part of this park. We were a group of 9 people ranging from 77 yrs to 12 yrs old. All of us could climb Moro rock all the way to the top to enjoy the beautiful views.

But very cool,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are into lots of stairs and amazing views, trek up Moro Rock. There are immediately awesome views all around, and the formation itself is really neat. The steps are solid but the railings feel quite low in places. I stayed to the inside and tried not to look down in many places; if you have little kids you might feel a bit nervous. It is a short and satisfying hike though; you can see 360 degrees and miles and miles from the top!"

It has an exhilarating view  from all directions.  It is a  challenging experience to climb to its top. 350 narrow steps lead to the top of the rock with a handrails  cable to hold to. Not for the fainthearted person.  A sign on the bottom warns you not to climb on a cloudy day or when lightning storm is expected. I did not climb it, just watched it from the first few steps.  The view was awesome."

I counted 8 cars in the parking lot.  We started to hike the longer trail up and saw a bear.  My family was thrilled I wanted to go back to the car because we knew we'd be coming down just after sunset in the dark.  So we went back to the car and drove to the closer parking lot.  It was beautiful and not overly difficult.  Yes, it has steps but not a lot.  People were outside the rails at the top and others tried to persuade them that this was dangerous.  Please people stay on the trail especially at elevation."
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Moro Rock Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Rewarding fast climb,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very rewarding, fast climb. There are railings on the stairs, so there's no reason to be afraid to climb it. When you get to the top, you have an amazing sweeping view of the natural beauty below. It is simply breath taking! In the age of covid, you have to be comfortable with people not being able to stay 6 feet apart. The stairway is taking traffic in both directions, and makes it impossible to maintain social distancing. If you are going to be a social justice warrior about it, best not to go! For all others, well worth it!"
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),Moro Rock Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Must see location,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a MUST see if you plan to do a single or multi day at Sequoia. We walked through the Moro rock trail starting from the Giant Forest Museum. Google Maps said the trail is about 30 min to complete but it took us a hour to the base of Moro Rock. We were pretty tired once we got to Moro Rock. Walking up Moro Rock was tough. The walkways are very narrow but there are areas that it opens up so you can catch your breath. Once youre at the top its an awesome view. Youll be glad you made it. Going back down is pretty easy than going up for sure.  If you plan to walk the entire trail from the museum, its about 4.5 miles round trip.  You can drive to the base of Moro Rock or take a shuttle if available."

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),General Sherman Tree,Historic Sites,4.5,The Biggest Tree in the World - MUST SEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This experience is one of the must sees in Sequoia and it is special but you have to get close to it.  The NPS has done a great job of creating a series of meandering paths that make it to the tree to prevent overcrowding.  I will say when you first see the tree, it can be a little underwhelming as there are trees much taller around it.  However, when you get close the massive girth of this 30' diameter tree is impressive and unreally.  If you look up you will see a single limb that by itself is as large as any in my hometown.  It is incredible and you cant capture it accurately without doing a vertical pano shot with your camera.  So many of the trees on the nearby Congress Trail are incredible but none match this one."

I guess everyone is looking for outdoor ""experiences' these days.  This is a very popular place to visit, with good reason.  There is TONS of parking, but it can still be difficult to find a spot in the summertime on the weekend.  The trail is paved, which makes it an easy walk.  It is a bit steep climbing up, but going down to the tree was fine.  The day we were there, it was very, very hot, about 105 degrees outside.  That made climbing more of a task.  It was difficult to social distance with the crowds, and many people were not wearing masks.  It seemed the larger groups with children were the ones who were not masked.  I  hope none of them got sick.  There were huge crowds in FRONT of the General Sherman tree, waiting to take pictures.  We walked around back and there was hardly anyone there.  Weird.  We also saw quite a few people with dogs, even though there was plenty of signage that said no dogs.  I guess people can't read.  I also did not see anyone cleaning up after their dog.  So sad.  There were signs instructing you to stay on the trail, but again, lots of people did not pay atteniton.  I guess folks want to experience nature, but not take care of it.  It makes me sad."

It's the biggest tree (by volume) in the world, so worth to take a look. by the way, there is a fallen tree truck with a hole, so you can walk through the tunnel, it's quite interesting, and both adults and kids love to go through it. It's a point of interest besides the Sherman tree, so if you go to this National park, it's a MUST to walk this trail and to take a look to the Sherman tree, also there are several giant red wood trees can be seen in this trail"

Trail to get there is easy; I would recommend going in the early hours of the morning so you can have the minimum people around you and that way you'll be able to take all in.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),General Sherman Tree,Historic Sites,4.5,General Sherman,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"At first I was not that impressed with the park (came in from the Three Rivers side); the drive in is a lot of dry brush some rocks and trees that don’t look much different than the ones on my street. That all changes slightly above 5000 ft. where you are almost instantly surrounded by the giant Sequoias. At the General Sherman site there is what is called accessible parking and then public parking about half a mile up the road. There were no shuttles running due to COVID restrictions. I am not a fan of walking, live at almost sea level, had been in the car for almost five hours and struggled with all the all uphill trip back to the main parking lot. The accessible parking is about ten yards from the tree. General Sherman is impressive and everything the books say it is. The paved path to the tree is smooth and there are some benches to sit on along the way. I was extremely disappointed that there were people who chose not to wear masks to protect others and weren’t considerate enough to at, least, social distance and give other people a chance to get close to the tree and other objects to view."
Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,California (CA),General Sherman Tree,Historic Sites,4.5,Prime example of what this park is about,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A must do on a Sequoia visit.  The NPS makes it as easy as possible to see a prime example of what this park is all about.  There is a wide, paved path all the way to the tree and around a loop that you can extend.  Along the trail are informative notes by the NPS.  There is plenty of parking at the trailhead and the Sequoia bus system stops at the bottom of the trail so you don't even have to do much walking.  People with inability to walk can also be let off at the bus stop and still avoid the elevation of the main path from the upper parking lot.  Immediately off Generals Highway."

We hiked several trails in the tundra but this was the only place I saw Pikas.  Yes, the cuddly oversized mountain mouse was abundant at this overlook and this was the only place I saw them in the park.  The views of a beautiful forested canyon between the tow tundra ridges is impressive.  However, I could not keep my gaze for long as spotting the mountain mammals darting in and out of the rocks was our major focus here.  I will say I did not get any pictures of the pikas as they do not stay in one place long; however, if you stop here you will see them.  "

Otherwise, the views are almost the same along the drive if you just want to take photos with your car window down. The little walk to this overlook will provide a some extra spots to see, and if you want to stretch you legs, it is a great place with parking. The best view to me at this overlook, were the numerous cars driving along Trail Ridge Road. That is a fun sight to see. While there may be many over looks that have pull-off parking in this park, few have actual parking lots just for an overlook, so that is nicer if you have kiddos. "

Bring a light jacket, water and hiking stick if your over 40 or don't hike at these elevations.  We saw one very fit extreme skier who hiked up the mountain to ski down, very impressive !!  We also saw several overweight middle aged types asking us ""is it much farther"" on our way out.😃"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alberta Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Harder hike on the return,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Getting to the falls is mostly downhill, so pretty easy. The return trip is much harder, especially if you aren’t used to the high elevation."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alberta Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Lovely waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike can be accessed from either the Bear Lake or the Glacier Gorge Trailhead.  From Bear Lake, you go down and then you have to climb up again to get to the falls, so we wished we had done it from Glacier Gorge, where it is all downhill on the way back (and also a shorter hike).  The trail will be busy, but the falls are lovely.  Beware that the ground squirrels on this trail have no fear and will come right up to you!  "
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alberta Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Easy hike to nice falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a fairly easy hike of about a mile each way, and is one of the few falls that has a way to the top. Quite crowded the day we went, so if you are looking for solitude, this is not it. There were families with kids of all ages hiking to these falls....lots of chipmunks to view and feed."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alberta Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,A great family hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This was a pretty easy hike.  Not too long but totally worth it!  One of our family's favorites.  We had kids (ages 16/13/11/9) to RMNP for the first time and were trying to balance seeing the beautiful mountains without overloading them with TOO much hiking.  Wanted to keep it fun for them and not have them start rolling their eyes when we said we were going on another hike!   This was the perfect hike for our last day.  Not too hard or long with a really neat destination.  Put this one on your must see list for the park.
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alberta Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Picturesque hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We hiked the snow-covered trail on December 26, 2019 to see a frozen, snow-covered water fall. Haha! But the hike was more picturesque than the hike up to Nymph lake. The trail has a couple of bridges and a few stands of the beautiful Colorado Aspens that made it worth it! We are not avid hikers, so I would say this is an easy hike. "
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alberta Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,These falls are absolutely beautiful. We loved being here and connecting with nature. Many people hike around here so no need to worry about isolation. If you are from a lower altitude you might want to wait a few days before going here.

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Lily Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful early evening at the Lily Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an easy walk around the lake, with beautiful views and scenery.  Take your camera, there are great spots for photos.  This also seems to be a good spot for sunsets.  We came after 6:00 PM on a Tuesday, and had no trouble parking.  Signs say you need timed entry passes for this area, but not sure if there is anyone around to enforce that.  We also walked over to the Baldpate Inn to check out the key collection, totally worth a few minutes of your time.  There is no admission charge for the keys."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Lily Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Really scenic!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Pretty little lake, we wished we had spent more time here but it was a quick stop while on this area of the park. It was neat seeing all the paedomorphic salamanders floating around in  the lake! Would be a really great picnic area. Definitely visit this section of the park because it has some beautiful scenery! Parking lot fills up fast."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Lily Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Nice lake outside of main Rocky Mtn park area,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This lake at 8940 feet is outside of the Rocky Mountain Park entrance on the eastern side off Hwy 7. The parking lot is small so finding a space may be difficult. It is a scenic alpine lake with a level easy trail around it. We only went a short distance on the lake. I am not sure if you need a timed entry pass here, but we didn't have a problem in the afternoon."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Lily Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Birds and more,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A flat loop leads around the lake with plentiful bird-watching. We also saw a muskrat swimming, collecting grass in its mouth. We were on our way to Wild Basin and I could have stayed longer. Other people were on the trail, but it wasn't crowded (compared to Bear/Dream/Emerald Lake). Bring a hat-the trail is exposed."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Lily Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Great for older hikers or handicapped!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very level and easily trail.

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Lily Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,"Pretty lake, easy to walk around",5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an easy walk around the lake and accessible to all. The views are gorgeous. Trails branch off the main path if you choose to take them. Picnic spots are dotted throughout the grounds. Parking in the small lot is limited or across the street. No one was in the booth to check our pass to enter the park when we went.
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Lily Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Another Great Lake Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was another short hike recommended by the park ranger at the Beaver Meadows visitor center since it snowed in mid/late May. We came here twice and enjoyed the solitude and views. It's also just along the road as you're leaving Estes Park and heading to Boulder. Restrooms and picnic tables, but not a pay station."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,"Busy, though beautiful",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started by viewing Bear Lake, which we thought was nice but didn't see why it was such a big deal. We then ended up hiking to Alberta Fall since it was less busy than the trail to all the lakes. From there we looked  at the map the park ranger had given us and decided to loop around to Lake Haiyaha (which is the best) and Nymph and Dream lakes back to the trailhead as it didn't look long. I must say it was long - according to my Fitbit we hiked roughly 7.5 miles by the time we were done. What we thought might take an hour or so ended up being 3.5 hours. it was a bit steep at times, but not bad compared to some of the hikes we had done earlier in the week This trail was worth it! We saw so much: waterfalls, lakes, wide open views, gorges, etc. My husband said it was in the top 3 of his favorite hikes we have ever taken."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Hike past Alberta Falls to Jewel Lake!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We started the morning at Sprague Lake to watch the sunrise and fortunate enough to see a moose herd eating in the lake. Then we adventured to Bear Lake and hiked past Alberta Falls to Mills and Jewel Lakes. It’s a 6+ mile uphill hike with some rocky trails but worth the effort. We were also fortunate to see a herd of elk at the tip of a jewel Lake. The round trip hike took us about 3hr and we walk at a relatively brisk pace. The views are spectacular! 
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Gateway to the best hikes in the park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Bear lake trailhead is your gateway to some of the best hikes in the park!  You can take an easy walk around beautiful bear lake itself to get started!  A super easy and accessible walk.  We always parked at the Park & Ride.  Took the shuttle up.  This is your gateway to Nymph, Dream, and Emerald lakes which is NOT to be missed.  You can also hike down to the Glacier Gorge area and directly onto the trail for Alberta Falls too!"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,A very central and popular trailhead,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the trailhead that you should choose if you are short on time at the Park.

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Bear Lake is a must see,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Awesome short hike,  recommend early morning visit either by car or shuttle bus.  We saw some ladies hiking in flip flops - bad idea especially if you take trail to Victoria Falls.  Walking stick was very helpful.  Snow still on trail late May.  It may not melt til late June.  The views of snowy peaks and the lake were awesome😃"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Spectacular!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My hike started at the Bear Lake Trailhead.  From there, I hiked the Dream Lake - Lake Haiyaha Trail to Emerald Lake.  The trails were really busy, especially near Bear Lake.  The temps were in the  mid to upper 20’s F.  There was packed snow and ice on the trail.  I rented micro spikes from a local mountain supply store.  Well worth it.   Spectacular hike!!"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Easy walk around the lake. Great photo ops! ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Enjoyed this nice walk that provides lots of good pictures in the late afternoon early evening.  The flies biting were next level.  Bring your spray even though it’s a quick walk around the lake. 
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Talk to the rangers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you get the chance, talk to one of the rangers at this popular spot.  We met a really nice retired school teacher from northwest Indiana.  He told us to do the Bear Lake hike, then take the trail for Alberta Falls.  From the Falls, take the Glacier Gorge trail, and catch the shuttle there.  It saved us a tough uphill hike back to Bear Lake.  Glad we were able to utilize the shuttle in that way."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake Trailhead,Hiking Trails,4.5,Great hike for anyone,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Nice trail to Emerald Lake.  Uphill quite a bit but some great scenery, some of the best on the east side.  I think Dream Lake is the best in that 3 lake series.  Fairly heavily trafficked."

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Must stop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the best visitor center in the park, there's a pretty big gift shop and a cafe, which is nice if you are taking your time along Trail Ridge Road. Wish we had been able to go back again as they had many items in the store you couldn't find at other visitor centers. The overlooks around the center were closed due to snow but it's a must stop regardless."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Nice view from the hill,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"You will likely stop here to go to the bathroom. The bathrooms are on the left side of the parking lot (vault style bathrooms). The visitors' center has a specified number of people allowed in at a time and Rangers are keeping it at that. The line was long so we didn't go in. The gift shop and cafe didn't have a limited number, but it had a one way path. Nice selection of stuff. Huffer's Hill was quite intense at the altitude, but the views were worth it. The majority of the people on the hill on a Monday afternoon were not wearing masks. It was more or less possible to stay six feet away, however."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5, Posed for COVID,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The building itself is closed for COVID, but the rangers stand outside and answer questions. There are nice restrooms. There is a short but steep hike right there with even better views. Lots of parking so that helps a lot, too. "
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Visitor's Center High Up,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This visitor’s center is at the peak altitude of Trail Ridge Road.  Aside from the usual visitor’s center, there is an adjacent store with a large selection of items and a cafe serving hot food and snacks.  From the visitor’s center, there are nice views into a valley.  Given the high altitude, take it easy and dress appropriately.  When we visited in September, the plumbing had been turned off in preparation for the winter and hence only the vault toilets were available."

The Alpine Visitor Center makes a great stopping point and a great spot to stretch your legs. Traffic was very slowly turning into the parking lot, but once inside there was plenty of parking.  You’ll find restrooms, a large gift shop, and a cafe. We sipped our coffee, overlooking a gorgeous view of RMNP"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Stunning views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This drive includes spectacular views around every bend (on that note, I recommend medication for anyone that becomes nauseated by long car rides or twists and turns).  Once you arrive at the top, there are restrooms (that you will likely want to avoid if possible), a visitor center with a ton of shopping options, snacks, and drinks.  You also have the option of taking the steps up to the highest point.  There are a large number of stairs and it is a high elevation so the walk/hike will not be for everyone."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Obligatory Stop with Food,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yeah, the concept of a 12,000 foot Visitor Center is awesome, and so were the views! But there are other visitor centers that are less crowded, and other bathrooms that don’t have a 25 minute wait. The highlight of this stop was huffer’s hill, a short but strenuous hike for sweeping views. I also enjoyed and recommend having a hot lunch at the Trail Ridge Store next to the visitor center."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Fog,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Completely fogged in both times we drove through. They don’t open until 9:30, which includes the flushable restrooms. There was quite a crowd already at 8:45 a.m., so I was surprised they didn’t open anything until 9:30."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Go up the stairs,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The visitor center is a must to get your passport stamp, rather large gift shop that is much larger than the visitor center.  Unless you really need to go to the bathroom, use a restroom at one of the pulloffs as the lines are long here.  Head up the stairs for a great view and to take a picture with the 12,000 foot elevation sign.  But take your time going up.  I'm in great cardio vascular shape and live in a mountain state, tried to go up at my normal speed and had to slow way down about halfway up, the altitude is no joke"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Short Hike - Nice Scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Alluvial Fan was the first hike we took in RMNP during our April 2022 trip. The day we went it was 19 degrees, Snowing and extremely windy. We bundled up and got out of the car anyway. The entire path is paved. There are two different parking areas that you can use to get to the same spot - just decide if you want a longer path or one with a little steeper grade. This was a neat spot and we were glad that we decided to brave the elements and check it out. This is a short hike/walk and on a beautiful 70 degree sunny day I'm sure its easy but up hill against that wind in the snow even this short hike was difficult at times. I would 100% try it out while in RMNP though."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alpine Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Great Views,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The views here were beautiful, however the parking is a nightmare! I visited for the first time recently from the UK. Visitors were literally battling for spaces, there simply weren't enough. There is a great gift store inside, restrooms and a few exhibits. Definitely a great place to stop if you can find a parking space!"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Take this Hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I'm so glad we took the short hike this time. Because we had driven by this area on a previous trip, I thought we'd seen everything. Not so. This short trail takes you to Horseshoe Falls and you see how large the rocks (created from two floods) really are."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Pretty falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We went early in the morning for photography. The walk is easy and short from either parking lot. Make sure to read the signs at the overlook explaining the fan. There is a nice picnic area from the parking lot. We saw elk and Steller’s Jays in the falls picnic area. From the lot you can walk Old Fall River Road as far as you’d like to go. On that walk we saw a large herd of elk and Magpies.
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Loved this area of the park!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We came in early June and there was a lot of water over the Alluvial Fan.  The hike is easy from either parking area with a wide, smooth path.   On our second trip to the falls, we were greeted by a moose who decided to cross the stream to eat the leaves on the other side.  "
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Worthwhile stop,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Short walk from the parking lot to a bridge to view the cascades of waterfalls coming down over the fallen rocks. You can walk up amongst the rocks to jockey for pic as others were doing as well. Really beautiful area to view without having to hike or climb far. Nice stop!
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Nice easy hike / walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Take the Old Fall River Road; the first part (from park entrance) is two-way, and you can get to the Alluvila Fan, and go back. However highly recommend to continue on the one-way dirt road (Old Fall River Rd.) it gives you more appreciation how people 100 years ago traveled."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Fairly short trail past a waterfall,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This trail is one way with a parking lot at either side. It is fairly short and level so even handicapped people can enjoy it. Parking can be difficult although the lot is a good size. A flood had happened here and 3 campers died.
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Short walk to beautiful falls,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We visited these falls while on our “winter in the park” tour. We parked and only had a 5-7 minute walk to visit the falls. Beautiful photo ops along the way and the walk was quite simple. Not difficult if you are not a hiker. Definitely worth a stop if you were going through Rocky Mountains National Park.
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,"Beautiful geologic wonder, devestating events",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"When visiting Rocky Mountain National Park, be sure and take a few minutes to explore the Alluvial Fan on the west end of Horseshoe Park. To reach the Alluvial fan you must get to US 34 on the west end of Horseshoe Park and take the road that takes you up Endo Valley to the start of the Old Fall River Road. When you turn off US 34 and head towards Old Fall River road you will almost immediately drive past the Lawn Lake trail head. In a few hundred yards you will come to a small parking lot which is on the east side of the Alluvial Fan. Continue on and you drive across the actual Alluvial Fan and reach the west parking lot. The West parking lot is the larger of the two lots and has restrooms and picnic tables. There is no fresh water available in either parking lot. Be warned that the Alluvial Fan is a very, very popular place and the parking lots fill early. On weekends there is very little parking available in Endo Valley and you may have to do some searching for a parking spot or visit later in the day when the crowds subside. If the lots are full, your best option is to go back out on US 34, turn to the right, heading west and drive 1/8th mile to a large parking lot on the left hand side of the road.  Park here. Then you can add a leisurely stroll through Horseshoe Park and Endo Valley onto your visit to the Alluvial Fan. Once you are situated with parking, you can begin your exploration of the Alluvial Fan. Before the Lawn Lake Flood in July, 1982, the emptying of the Roaring River into Endo Valley was quite unremarkable. If you stand in the west parking lot and look into the forest to the west you can see what the valley floor looked like before the Alluvial Fan was formed. Very peaceful valley and forest. Then, on July 15, 1982, an old irrigation dam on Lawn Lake, miles from and 2,500 feet above Endo Valley failed and a flood washed down the Roaring River scouring out trees, topsoil, rocks and boulders down to the bed rock. Three people in the Park lost their lives in the flood waters and the many, many thousands of tons of debris was washed out the mouth of the Roaring River and deposited on the Endo Valley floor to create the Alluvial Fan. Driving up Trail Ridge Road you get amazing views of the destruction when you get beyond Many Parks Curve. Then, starting on September 9, 2013, a low pressure weather system stalled over the Big Thompson drainage and for the next few days, rain storms dumped inch upon inch upon inch upon inches of rain, saturating the soil and causing another flood on the Roaring River. All the trails and bridges the Park had built on the Alluvial Fan were washed and scoured away as thousands more tons of rock and debris were washed down the Roaring River. There is a sign on the west side of the Alluvial Fan that gives a good visual reference of how much additional debris came down in the second flood. The river bed moved to the far west side of the Alluvial Fan as a result of the flood waters and debris. The Park decided to leave the Alluvial Fan in its new condition without and major reconstruction. So what you see today is pretty much what the first visitors saw when the flood waters subsided. As you explore the Alluvial Fan from the parking lots you will be on social trails that bring you up the rock and debris. This can be rough walking on loose and uneven terrain. Be careful. The social trails lead to the river bed and eventually, the cascade where Roaring River leaves its upper valley gorge and spills onto the Alluvial fan. Below the debris field the Roaring River flattens and quiets and gently flows down to its joining Fall River on the Endo Valley floor. As you explore, you will be hopping across rocks and boulders that were once buried hundreds of thousands of years ago and carried for miles from up above by the rushing flood waters. As you hike along the stream bed you come to a very nice little waterfall and closer examination shows it to be one of the old bridges from the trails that were built after the Lawn Lake Flood. When you reach the cascade you will be looking at bed rock that had once been covered for millions of years but has now been exposed and polished smooth by two consecutive flood events. Be very careful scrambling around on this newly exposed rock. Slips and falls have nasty consequences here. Since improved trails were destroyed in the last flood, the alluvial fan is not accessible by wheel chairs and walkers. But families with younger children who love to scramble around on rocks will find an amazing playground here. Make sure you keep a very close eye on the children near the river because the swift water can carry them way and they will have a very rough and tumble experience being washed through the boulders and rocks in the stream bed. While exploring the Alluvial Fan you may also have a chance to see the herd of Big Horn Sheep that inhabit the area. It is a thrill to see these shy but majestic animals in this rugged scenery. There are also many different kinds of birds, including Magpies, Gray Jays, Clarks Nutcrackers,Turkeys, Stellar Jays, Blue Jays, Blue Birds, Chickadees, Hawks, Eagles and Great Horned Owls. Check out times for bird walks that leave from here. You will also probably see Elk and Deer and the occasional Moose. On rare occasions you may also come across a bear and maybe some cubs. For me, the best time to experience the Alluvial Fan and surrounding sites is at, or just after, sunrise. The day is new, many animals are active and the crowds have not arrived yet. Parking is easy to find and not much compares to a quiet breakfast and hot cup of coffee, tea or cocoa, sitting in the forest surrounded by nature. So make sure and visit the Alluvial Fan and enjoy what this relatively new feature has to offer you."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Alluvial Fan,Geologic Formations,4.5,Short walk to interesting feature,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Alluvial Fan was formed when an earthen dam broke up in the mountains, and the water came rushing down the hill.  Rocks, trees, and even big boulders were carried by the water and strewn everywhere in its path."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,A “MUST” at RMNP,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Absolutely amazing! The photos don’t do it justice! You have to see it with your own eyes! We hiked it on June 23, 2020 and there was still some snow on the trail. The hike is easy to moderate at times. But my 3 and 6 year old managed it with several breaks so any healthy adult should be able to make it, too. My main suggestion: go early! After 8am the tailhead parking starts to fill up and you have to take a long bus ride. Also, if you get to Emerald Lake after 10am, it starts to get crowded, even with the COVID-19 reservation system in place. There’s only so many rocks to sit on and enjoy the views. Also, if you get there after noon, the sun angle is not as ideal for photos and you risk getting caught is afternoon storms. Enjoy this amazing beauty!"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Gorgeous lakes, not too bad of a hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful lake hike, definitely recommend going all the way to Emerald if you're able because it is the most scenic. Dream Lake is also very pretty. I struggled with the elevation the whole week we spent in Colorado and the first uphill climb on the trail was a bit difficult due to that (we passed plenty of other people resting as well!). I would say this first section to Nymph lake was the toughest, and everything after was much easier. The trail was packed with snow after Dream Lake, but we did fine with just hiking boots (no spikes). You just have to be careful and take your time going up/down the snowbanks. We started around 9:30 or so and it wasn't too crowded but started to get busy on our descent. This is definitely a must do in the park and there's good reason why this trail is so popular."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Beautiful Hike But Go Early,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful hike. Rated as moderate and most reasonably fit individuals should be able to hike it without much difficulty. Starts at the Bear Lake Trailhead and includes Bear Lake, Nymph Lake, Dream Lake and Emerald lake. This is arguably the most popular hike in RMNP and can get quite busy which takes away some from the experience and is why I didn't give it the highest rating . Begin shortly after sunrise to avoid the crowds. The Bear Lake Trailhead still had plenty of parking spots at 730am on a Thursday morning in early September but was full by 7am on the Friday morning of Labor Day weekend even with entrance restrictions in place. Very easy to park in the Park and Ride and take the 15 min shuttle back and forth which runs every 10 minutes."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Icy trail,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We happened to come here after a cold front hit with snow and ice. The previous day was 90 degrees!! I can’t say I saw anything nice because it was so foggy but I still enjoyed the hike. Of course it was more difficult in the snow and ice but it was doable with poles. Loved seeing the Stellar’s Jay and the Black billed magpies. We were surprised how crowded the trail was...we arrived around 10am and people were still arriving at 1pm...parking lot was packed even with the weather. The other couple we were with found the trail too strenuous and went around bear trail lake instead. Five stars if I could’ve seen the pond. 
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Beautiful scenery on moderately easy hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Beautiful hike! For me I’d say it was a moderately easy hike. I really enjoyed getting the see Nymph and Dream lake as well. It was raining lightly and misting pretty much the whole hike but they actually gave it something extra special. We went in late august and probably due to the rain it was a bit chilly. Although being a native Texan my idea of chilly compared to others might be different. Definitely needed a light jacket and am glad I chose pants instead of shorts! We did this hike at around 8-9 a.m. and it was too crowded. Loved it so much.

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Challenging Hike through Snow but Worth the View!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My friend and I visited in mid-May and the trails were almost 100% snow covered and also most of the lakes (Emerald, Dream, Nymph) were still pretty frozen. Hiking on snow on these steeply inclined trails was pretty challenging, but it made the trek worth it in the end. Even with how snowy the trails were, there were hundreds of people on these trails which did detract a bit from the overall peacefulness of the experience. We were also concerned there would be no parking since we arrived close to 12:30pm but we were lucky to find one of the last spots. If this was mid-May, I cannot imagine what this park is like in terms of crowds during the peak summer season. I personally would prefer less crowds so I am content with having gone during off-peak in May even if the lakes were still pretty solid, the trails were snow covered and the wildflowers and spring vegetation had not yet bloomed."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Beautiful Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent a few days hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park, and this was the best we encountered.  The trail begins at Bear Lake and proceeds mostly at a moderate climb to Nymph Lake, then Dream Lake then Emerald Lake.  Although it's not an easy trail by any means, we did see a lot of older and novice hikers taking it on, so any healthy individual should be able to complete the round trip even if you have to take a lot of rest stops.  The scenery is well worth the effort, especially around Emerald Lake.  As you trek along Dream Lake, look for cutthroat trout swimming along the shallow shoreline.  The total distance is about 3 1/2 miles roundtrip, so I'd commit a half day to this adventure so you can take your time and enjoy the beauty. Bring lots of water!"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,"If you only take one hike, this should be the one!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This has been a favorite every time I visit RMNP since my childhood!  I took my husband and kids (ages 16/13/11/9) for the first time this summer and this was a standout to everyone.  We parked at the Park and Ride.  Hike is strenuous enough to feel like you are working without being too much.  Lots of snow on the ground this trip to hike on so bring a walking stick if you need a little more stability.  Kids thought the snow was so cool, and loved all the beautiful lakes on the hike.  Emerald Lake is stunning...the perfect crystal clear mountain lake.  Dream Lake is a spot on the way and could be your destination too if you wanted.  It is also magical.  But Emerald Lake is worth it to keep going!!  Beautiful vistas along the hike too.  Best hike in the park in my opinion...not to be missed."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Emerald Lake Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing Hike and Scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were at the Park for half a day and did the perfect hike.  I would say that the difficulty was Easy to Intermediate and the roundtrip was 3.6 miles.  What was super nice about it was that at approximately every 1/2 mile there was a beautiful lake for us to see.  The first was Nymph lake, then Dream lake, and then Emerald lake.  And then alongside the lakes were magnificent mountain peaks."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Old Fall River Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Give it a try,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Took this road on the way up to the alpine visitor center. Not a ton of places to stop but great views along the way. It is a one way drive so really not that scary and I think any car would do. Would recommend using GypSy guide for RMNP, provides good commentary and even lets you know when you are getting to the “scarier” parts of the drive."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Old Fall River Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Closed!,1.0 of 5 bubbles,We drove through the park from the Grand Lake Entrance only to find out that the Old Fall River Road was closed!

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Old Fall River Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Historic One-Way (UP) Road,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This historic road was on our must-do list and it didn't disappoint. It's hard to imagine the work that went into creating this more than 100 years ago. The driver shouldn't have a fear of heights! Sit behind the driver if you're the nervous type. Take the hairpin switchback turns wide and you shouldn't have a problem in most vehicles (note there are size limits/restrictions). We stopped to bird-watch in the forest along flat stretches and let other vehicles pass so we could take our time. The elevation gain is impressive. You can't turn around until you reach the Alpine Visitor Center, so be sure you want to go before you start!"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Old Fall River Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Original road to summit,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Interesting original road to Alpine Visitor’s Center.  Drive slowly and watch road carefully as there are many deep ‘ruts’.  My husband drove the Prius capably and neither of us found the drive ‘scary’.  We traveled mid-week in late September entering the park at 11am.  There was not too much traffic and we stopped at many of the turnouts.  The drive took us 1.75 hours with plenty of stops and traveling under 15 mph.  We returned to Estes Park via Trail Ridge Road.  I purchased Gypsy guides which provided interesting commentary
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Old Fall River Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,By far the best way to get up to the visitor center.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Taking this road is by far the best way to get to the visitor center. You can then complete the loop by driving down the paved road and checking out the other sites/views. Being from the PNW, I found the entire park decently scenic, but not breath taking. This drive made the loop far more worthwhile, as we felt closer to nature and more “in” the park than when on the paved hwy. I would highly recommend anyone visiting the park in a vehicle with decent clearance to take this route. We didn’t need 4x4, but in a few spots vehicle clearance helped. Not essential if you’re a crafty driver."

So many awesome views and we loved it.  If you have the time and the nerve, try it.  If you don't like heights and curves, we suggest you forgo this one. We saw many cars doing it also.  I would suggest front wheel drive though.  "
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Old Fall River Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Highlight of the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This one-way dirt-packed road might be intimidating, but it is well worth it! Lots of scenery and views that can't be seen elsewhere. Just go slow and just about any vehicle should be fine. We were in a pick-up and a few switchbacks required us to take two attempts. Don't miss the Chasm Falls near the beginning of the road, up after a switchback while you are heading west. Far better than the Alberta Falls, and far easier to get to."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Old Fall River Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Beautiful drive to enjoy the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The drive was great! My husband drove, so I got to enjoy all the views. Take your time, stop whenever you can and take a walk to soak it in, You can take a short hike in the alpine meadows, before you get to the top, look at myriad of flowers and enjoy the solitude. Take the first hike up before you get to the alpine center, it has much better views, although it is more strenuous.  Go as early as possible in am, the road gets crowded."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Old Fall River Road,Scenic Drives,4.5,Must do when going from east side of the park to west side.  Views you will not get otherwise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Awesome drive.  One way only from East side of the park to the West side/ Alpine Visitor's Center.  It is a dirt road but very hard packed and easy to drive on.  There are lots of switch backs as you climb and climb some more.  You only go about 15 miles per hour (if that depending on who you might be driving behind) but that is a perfect speed to enjoy the scenery.  It is about 10 miles and takes about 1.5 hours so you are going very slow and stopping for the views along the way.  Fabulous views first the greenery and then the tundra as you get higher and higher.

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sprague Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Very user friendly walk with everything wonderful RMNP has to offer in one stop!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was my favorite hike in the park and I would consider us intermediate hikers. I felt like oh this is just a quick stop at sunrise but wow, was it wonderful. Super flat wide path around the lake so more of a walk but it had so many treasures. Parking super close, picnic area. The path meandered over streams, the lake view grew more spectacular with each new vantage point we walked counterclockwise and went to watch the sunrise. A momma moose and her calf were feeding, flowers, trees, Mountain View’s, sounds, smells, breezes. Everything you imagine National park to be in this walk that was very easy and would be great if not up for a hike."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sprague Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Sprague Lake Easy Winter Stroll with Good Scenery,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a very accessible and easy walk for good winter time views of Hallets peak, a frozen Sprague Lake, and the surrounding winter environs. The trail is essentially level and it has several viewing locations with benches. However, walking spikes or crampons are recommended in winter. Great for photography and watching the dramatic weather move over Hallets and Flattop. Allow at least 2 hours for a leisurely stroll. You are unlikely to be disappointed no matter what time of the year or time of the day you choose to go. But winter has far, far fewer visitors. For photography go before noon for the best shots of Hallets."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sprague Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Peaceful Insane Beauty!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My wife and I stopped at Sprague Lake and then came back later to do the walk around the lake.  I was not thinking that it would be very good as the trail is dead flat and its a very short hike.  I typically like the challenging hikes with lots of climbing and amazing vistas.  This hike REALLY surprised me.  It was short and easy but CRAZY beautiful.  We enjoyed an easy stroll- no backpacks, no water and took our time enjoying all the views around the lake.  We talked to several other couples and even watched a young woman fly fishing as she caught a small fish!  I would highly recommend this hike to everyone.  Don't poo poo it like I did.  Sprague Lake is worth the stop!"

In the lake was a beautiful buck elk, and further on up was a young moose!  Picture perfect!  Then, toward the parking lot (we were lucky to find a spot right away) was a herd or family of elk, just bedding down.  I almost accidently walked up on one, peeking through the trees.  Too close for comfort.  "
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sprague Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Great place to watch the sunrise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got up really early and went to sprague Lake to watch the sunrise. It is perfect to watch the sunrise and the lake. Being up early, we saw a mama moose with two calves eating by the lake. It was a great morning. Also, Sprague Lake is less crowded than Bear Lake and was very easy to get a parking spot. No parking available at bear lake. I liked Sprague lake better"
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sprague Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,"Family friendly, breathtaking hike",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We decided on the Sprague Lake trail for our trip to Rocky Mountain National Park after getting the recommendation from my sister, who’s a local. It was perfect for our two young kids who are still working on stamina. The trail was also very even, which was great for my daughter who struggles with physical coordination. The trail loops around a lake, with stunning views of the mountains and close up views of beautiful flowers. Highly highly recommend for families of young kids! There is also a big picnic area, although we did not use it. You should be aware that you do need to order a timed entry pass online ahead of time to gain access to this area."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sprague Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Love Sprague Lake!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was our first time to go to Sprague Lake. It is so beautiful, we went several times. If you go before 5:00 AM you can get in without a timed entry. We got up at 4:00 AM and drove into the park. We arrived at approximately 4:30AM. It was worth it to see the sunrise! There was a family of elk. We were on the boardwalk and one elk thought we were too close and charged me just a little. Wanted me to get away. Keep your distance and you will be fine.  We didn't see a moose as others have said, but we did see one at Sheeps Lake in the evening. "
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sprague Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were told to come early morning or late afternoon to see the bull moose that frequents the lake. Early AM wasn't an option for the group, so we tried four different afternoon/evenings and never saw him. Ducks, chipmunks and field mice were spotted. But it is a beautiful area and a flat level wide path for a nice walk and beautiful photos if there's no wind and the surface of the lake is flat for reflections. Fishermen nearby caught/released small trout. The path is currently under construction (the right side as you enter from the parking lot) so you have to walk partway and return on each side."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Sprague Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,"Perfect hike, even after knee surgery!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail had bathrooms at the trailhead and a parking lot.  The 3/4 mile trail circled the lake, had a clear and open path, and provided spots to sit down or take pictures.  It provided a short hike with great views.  My husband had knee surgery before our trip and had no trouble.  It also seemed to be a good choice for families with young children."

It's a easily accessible and pretty lake, we walked around the whole thing and it was flat, nice walk to stretch your legs. We passed a whole family of geese, including several babies which was nice to see! We saw several people in the lake fishing as well. Nice little picnic spot. Little effort to get there and nice scenery!"

Our guide was Floyd and he went WAY above and beyond what we ever could have imagined. Our 8 year old was experiencing extreme altitude sickness and he was so patient, so kind and even let us use his shower at his home to help clean her up.  Amazing.  After that situation, he got us into the park and continued to be incredibly patient and understanding of our situation.  He got in the snow and taught my kids how to use his snow saw, helped them learn how to make ""pinwheels"" by rolling the snow down a hill and was so empathetic with our need for frequent rests for our 8 year old. I highly, highly recommend this tour and Floyd!!!!  It was a gorgeous hike. The views cannot be beat.  We traveled through several places on our Colorado trip and these views were truly unbeatable!!  Floyd, if you ever read these, THANK YOU again!!!!!  So so grateful for our experience."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Nice Scenic Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Judging from the amount of people and the need for reservations, Bear Lake is one of the most popular sites in RMNP and definitely worth a visit.  The scenic path around the lake is relatively easy to walk around and only has limited elevation changes. If the water is still, you can get nice reflections of the nearby landscape.  At the trailhead by the parking lot, volunteers are stationed to answer any questions and there are vault toilets.  "

I really enjoyed this beautiful location and visited the lake and walked the trail several times during my visit.  Accessed from the very popular Bear Lake Trailhead, if you want to find parking, come early or late in the day, preferably midweek, otherwise you will likely need to take the shuttle from remote parking about 3 miles (4.8k) away."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Go at sunrise!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Bear Lake trails made up our favorite hike at RMNP. We went to the trails our first day and could not find a parking spot at the trailhead so we decided to hike other potions of the park. We went back on day 2 (at dawn) and noticed a sign that said the parking lot was full but decided to drive to the trailhead anyway. Upon reaching the parking lot we could see the lot was not even halfway filled. Going to the trails at dawn had many benefits including open parking, less crowded trails, and excellent lighting for taking pictures. I would suggest getting up early to visit these trails, they shouldn’t be missed! If you must come later in the day, take the shuttle. "
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful and accessible trail around lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Was in RoMo NP for a day trip and Bear Lake was the last stop for us. It is easily accessible from the parking lot and therefore pretty crowded. But the lake itself is large enough people are spread out along the rim. Beautiful scenery, backdrop of the mountains with spruce and rock outcroppings framing the perimeter. It takes about 30 min to walk around the lake and most people go on to the Emerald/Dream Lake trail. Multiple spots for gorgeous pictures. Highly recommended."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Bear Lake,Bodies of Water,4.5,"Iconic, but average",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Every guidebook out there says that Bear Lake is a must do. It's apparently the most visited place in RMNP, and based on the crowds, I believe it. But, at least for our group, Bear Lake was merely okay. It's a small lake with nice peaks around it. We walked around it easily in about 40 minutes. It reminded us of Silver Lake in Utah. Don't get me wrong; it was nice. But if you are willing to hike a bit more, there are other places that are more breath-taking. Also, it is a very crowded path, and only about 50% of the people on this path wore masks. It was difficult to distance. We arrived around 3:30, and the sign at the park and ride said that the Bear Lake lot was full, but we took a chance, and there were about 15 open spaces to park on a Friday afternoon."

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Trail Ridge Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Wow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Got to see this but there is a catch. The park requires reservations to drive this road. There is a limited amount of permits but if you plan ahead you can get the reservation.  We took it all the way through since we were heading onto Montrose and we had all day to get there. Beautiful scenery and great photo opps. Wish we had stayed in Estes Park to give us a little more time here. We will have to come back here and spend a couple of days.
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Trail Ridge Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Great overview of the national park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We entered the park from the Grand Lake Entrance on a mission to drive Old Fall River Road (which was closed when we got there).  We drove as far as the Fall River Visitor Center.  Of course, the road is scenic!  There's many places to stop along the way to do a hike, see wildlife and gasp at the beautiful overlooks.  There are more moose on the Grand Lake park side if that's what you are looking for.  We saw loads of moose and elk each time we went into the park.  This ride gives you a great overview of the entire park.  Along with the park map, you can then determine which sites you want to explore further.  As you drive through the Alpine Visitor Center area of the park, you'll definitely notice a chance in temperatures.  We were there in July and it was windy and quite chilly due to the higher elevations.  Beautiful to see."
Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Trail Ridge Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Absolutely gorgeous but a bit anxiety inducing!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an absolutely breathtaking road (maybe in more ways than one if you struggle with the elevation like I did). It is amazing to see the change in scenery as you go along. We did the whole road from Grand Lake to Estes, and then one evening went halfway up from Estes to the Alpine Visitor Center. Highly recommend driving the whole thing at least once, and it does take the good half of a day if you do the stops. Definite evidence of the fire when starting out in Grand Lake but it got scenic very quickly. I have never struggled with mountain road drives, have done Newfound Gap, Icefields Parkway, and the Blue Ridge Parkway and been totally fine but there are many parts of this road that gave me extreme anxiety, specifically around the tundra. Absolutely worth seeing but do keep in mind if you are scared of heights or just scary roads. Whoever is driving needs to be very careful and mindful. I can't express how beautiful it was though, and I loved seeing the tundra because I had never seen anything like that before. We saw a herd of elk around the top which was surprising! It got pretty cold and extremely windy so bring a jacket. You can stop at the visitor center, which is the biggest and best in the park, and they even have a little cafe."

We didnt see any moose, which is what a lot of people look for, but we did see a small herd of elk and a baby. There are daily reservations you have to purchase prior to going or you will have to wait till 5 pm and purchase a day pass. They have other pass options but if you are only going this one time for awhile just the day will be plenty. There are a lot of people up there at any point and time and they will: pull off the road, pull somewhat off the road, or park in the middle of the road; so they can take a picture of whatever animal they came across. The drive is up one side of the mountain and down the other, so it will be hard on your car and breaks. Make sure to drive in lower gears so you don't hurt either. Take a camera and binoculars! You might find something far off that no one else can see!"

We traveled in late May and there was still snow in the past. I do recommend being all the way to the top of the mountain before 5:00 p.m. because you can buy hot chocolate at a gift shop.

Rocky Mountain National Park,Colorado (CO),Trail Ridge Road,Scenic Drives,5.0,Spectacular,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Driving Trail Ridge Road is a thrilling and spectacular experience. 48 miles separate Estes Park from Grand Lake. It takes 90-120 minutes to drive factoring in making stops at the numerous overlooks. I think the best overlooks are Rainbow Curve, Forest Canyon, and Gore Range. You should also stop at the Alpine Visitor Center and walk the trail. Even better is the Tundra Communities Trail near Rock Cut. Look for the marmots providing entertainment on the south side of the road across from the parking spaces. The Milner Pass area was quite beautiful at sunset and I saw many elk in the area at this time of day. The western portion of the Road is good for moose spotting especially near the Green Mountain Trailhead. The best part of the drive is between Medicine Bow Curve and Rainbow Curve in the alpine tundra zone."

Just drove the road from Estes Park to Grand Lake and contrary to all the reviews saying it is the scariest drive, the drive itself is not scary at least not during the daytime.  At no point was I any more scared to drive this than  any other mountain road.  It is like most mountain roads in that if you were to drive off the edge it would not be a good time.  However, if you are paying attention and driving at or near the speed limit it is very safe.  I read that the road grade never exceeds five percent so it is an overall easy drive to handle."

Beware however, not strenuous does not mean not difficult.  While the trail to the beach, in itself pretty, is not challenging physically, the last 25-50 yards will give pause to anyone that is mobility challenged, less than sure footed, somewhat leery of heights or a young child.  The trails ends on a rocky outcropping, which you descend on sometimes gravelly rocks to the beach.  This last bit has to be overcome to fully enjoy the scenic setting.  A very small parking lot at the trailhead may cause you to circle for a bit or increase your distance from the starting point."
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Enderts Beach,Beaches,4.5,Tide Pooling and Banana Slugs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We always enjoy tide pooling and Enderts Beach did not disappoint.  Not only was the tide pooling very interesting with the many starfish and large green anemone, the rocky coast with the many sea stacks in the morning fog was beautiful, and along the lush trail from the parking area to the beach we saw many wildflowers and quite a few banana slugs; not having visited the Pacific Coast this far north before, these were new experiences for us.

Redwood National Park,California (CA),Enderts Beach,Beaches,4.5,Tide Pool Heaven!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did a Ranger led tour of the tide pools early one morning. My teens were not happy about getting up this early but were so happy they did! The tide pools are abundant with a variety of cool species! We got to feed giant green anemones, touch leather starfish and hold iridescent sea slugs! On the way back from the tide pools we even saw the resident river otter with her two babies. This place is a must see if you love tide pools."

Redwood National Park,California (CA),Enderts Beach,Beaches,4.5,Quiet seclusion and beautiful scenery!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I have been to Enderts Beach twice now.  Once about 13 years ago with just my wife and again recently with our kids.  We loved it both times.  You park up on the bluff and take a short .75 mile trek down to the beach.  If you have mobility issues you may not want to attempt as the hike back up can be a little strenuous and getting down to the beach at the bottom requires some scrambling down rocks.  The beach was not crowded, maybe 20 or so people on our most recent visit.  We went at low tide to visit the tide pools and they were great.  We saw a seal on our last visit and a sea otter this time around.  I highly recommend this beach as a quiet place to explore what the Northern CA coast has to offer."
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Enderts Beach,Beaches,4.5,Short walk to pristine and wild beach (with cell coverage!),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Enderts Beach is not a swimming beach. It's a wild beach that requires a short 1 mile walk. But not only is the walk interesting, the beach has an arch, trees thrown up by the sea, rocks and tidepools teeming with life."
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Enderts Beach,Beaches,4.5,Tide pools,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is the beach in northern California for tide poolIng. At low tide you can walk around and see star fish and giant sea anemone and other interesting things. There are many colors of sea stars and it is fascinating. The beach requires a short hike of about a half mile each way. The day I went there was no one else there and the only tracks on the beach when I arrived were from a mountain lion that had apperantly walked down the beach before we got there.
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Tall Trees Grove,Forests,5.0,Amazing secluded hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had a blast on this fairly secluded hike seeing massive trees, a young deer family, banana slugs and enjoying the peace of the forest!  The hike isn't terribly hard but the way back is steep so take your time - you also drive on a dirt road for a bit so be prepared.  Make sure you get your permit early as they are electronic only due to Covid.  Absolutely worth the effort!"

The awe isn’t lost but subsides a bit and you focus on factors like trail distance, crowds, and mud. This trail has beautiful scenery and pretty smooth trails considering. Lot less mud and roots compared to Boy Scout trail. I’d still say Rockefeller loop has more awestruck moments in less area. But the effort to obtain these views is pleasurable, I like the challenge of the 800 ft. decent to the valley floor but not everyone will."

Redwood National Park,California (CA),Tall Trees Grove,Forests,5.0,Remote but absolutely worth the effort,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"To get to this remote hike, you have to first pop in to the visitor center near Orick to get a free pass and the key code to the locked gate at the mouth of the gravel road which you drive down to the trailhead. 7 miles or so driving from the 101, interior (away from the ocean). 6-6.5 miles from the locked gate to the trailhead. Slow driving but you are going through a special forest so take your time and soak it in."
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Tall Trees Grove,Forests,5.0,Stunning hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This hike was jaw droppingly beautiful. I was born and raised in California and grew up visiting redwood forests throughout my life, but this hike still blew my mind. The difference between old growth forests and secondary growth forests is huge! Not just the width of the trees, the forest here felt so ancient and lush too. Definitely worth the visit!"
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Tall Trees Grove,Forests,5.0,Highly recommend!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The hike is a little less than 4-miles and is shaped like a cul-du-sac (or, as the ranger described it, a lollipop). The elevation change at the beginning and end of the hike is 800 feet, descending at the start and ascending the 800 feet back up at the end. Trust us though—every switchback, incline, and muddy patch is worth the reward of the Tall Trees Grove. "

Thomas Kuchel is the Visitor Center for this park, and it remains open during Covid, although for limited hours. We hiked Trillium Falls Trail, which is a fairly easy trail with good traction, and walked through LBJ grove. The rest of our time was spent at Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park to the north, which has a more extensive system of hiking trails. There were no fees to enter, and both parks were quiet on week days."

There is just something indescribable about standing underneath the massive redwoods.
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Redwood National Park,State Parks,5.0,Amazing National Park with the Tallest Trees and so much More,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It would be easy to simply think of Redwoods as a forest park, as we did hike in two groves with the tallest trees in the world but visiting it exposes that it is so much more.  It is meadows and mountains, creek valleys and shorelines.  It is unique wildlife like Roosevelt Elk and banana slugs as well as whales and sea lions.  It also is not just a National Park but 3 California State parks that protected groves 50 years before the NPS.  Finally it has incredible forest scenic drives but also amazing mountain overlooks.  "
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Redwood National Park,State Parks,5.0,Huge Beautiful Trees,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The huge trees of Redwood National Park really blew me away. Before coming here, I had an idea of what to expect, but I did not know how much I'd love being next to trees that are hundreds of feet old and hundreds of feet high. Redwood National Park is also located next to the Pacific Ocean so besides the trees, it also includes beaches. When we went in mid May, it was very rainy, cool and had a bit of fog too. "
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Redwood National Park,State Parks,5.0,Gorgeous!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Loved this park. What I always do when going to any national park is stop at the visitors center first.

Redwood National Park,California (CA),Redwood National Park,State Parks,5.0,Awe-inspiring Nature,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Redwood Forest is so grand and magnificent it is hard not to be in awe. The trees alone are incredible, and the many trails and small info-stands all around the park make it a interesting and fun area to hike in.

Redwood National Park,California (CA),Redwood National Park,State Parks,5.0,Redwoods and More!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"What an amazing day we spent at Redwood National Park!  There is no way to adequately describe the beauty and splendor of this place.  We hiked through Lady Bird Johnson Grove in awe as we walked amongst these giant Coastal Redwoods.  Besides the trees, there were unusual bushes, lots of wildflowers and the occasional wildlife  - from our car, we were surprised to see a young black bear in the road, probably 300+ pounds, foraging for food. He was so surprised to see us that he froze long enough for us to get LOTS of photos.  What a treat and it made our trip to Redwood even more memorable!"
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Redwood National Park,State Parks,5.0,A Beautiful National/State Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful and incredible all year around, but a winter visit was on the schedule this time.  The winter storm made it somewhat challenging, but were still able to largely get to most places.  Staff at the Visitor Centers were friendly and helpful - esp considering some of the weather related closures.  Bald Hills Road was exciting in 10+ inches of snow.  Lady Bird Johnson Grove was a wonderful walk, as were a number of other trails."
Redwood National Park,California (CA),Redwood National Park,State Parks,5.0,Once in a Lifetime,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My wife and I had went on a trip to California and one thing I requested was see the redwood forest. This was a bit out of the way for us as we hit Yosemite and San Francisco in this trip totally 1500 miles. IT WAS WORTH IT. The drive was to no where but the view was fantastic and when we arrived finally I didn’t have words. Going through the Avenue of Giants was great but does not compare to the redwood forests. Prairie Creek has the best trail and trees. True monsters. I won’t be coming back to California anytime soon as we take a big trip every 2 years somewhere new but I would highly recommended this no matter the distance.

I will not be the same person after seeing this and knowing the magnificent powers of my God to have created so much for us to wonder at and to know his pure artistic genius. It brought tears to my eyes to see so many rocks, colors textures just waiting for me to discover. I'm not by any means an adventurer but i truly wanted to hike into this area and not come back. Please come visit this place it's quiet and very interesting even mind blowing if you need to shake things up a bit and if you are looking for it spiritual."

The path is paved and very easy to walk. I would not consider this a hiking trail. It is more a path to stroll on and admire the petrified wood. There is plenty to see. Make sure to see  the largest petrified   log “Old Faithful” in this section. You do not want to miss it (although that would be hard to do if you walked the whole path, which I would encourage everyone to do)"

Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Giant Logs Loop,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,The Largest Petrified Trees - MUST SEE,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a short trail that contains the largest, petrified logs in the park, including ""Old Faithful"" the largest petrified tree in the park.  Most every tree in this section is massive, even the blocks that have broken apart.  Yes the trail is short and not really a significant source of exercise.  However, the logs are simply massive here.  For me this is a must visit.  While you can see petrified wood in many other places in the southern half of the park, no where will you see logs that are this large.  They are unbelievable."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Giant Logs Loop,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Nice easy loop with several good examples of petrified wood,4.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a nice easy loop near the visitor center.

Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Giant Logs Loop,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Can Skip if you Do Crystal Forest Trail,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"While visiting Petrified Forest National Park, we did the .6 mile Giant Logs Trail.  It is not paved and only took us 15 minutes to do the loop.  If you do the Crystal Forest Trail, you would not need to do this one.  The Crystal Forest was the best spot to see Petrified Wood."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Giant Logs Loop,Nature & Wildlife Areas,4.5,Giant logs,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Like the name says it's a trail with giant logs. The advantages to this trail are that it's right behind the south visitor center which makes it easy to access. But it also means more people are around which is annoying during Covid. I preferred the Crystal Forest as I thought those logs were more colorful and unique.

Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Long Logs Loop,Nature & Wildlife Areas,5.0,Favorite site at the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is my favorite site in the National Park. It's less crowded than the other sites because 1) you have to park a little ways away at the visitor center instead of right at the path and 2) you have to walk a bit to see everything (about 2.5 miles from the parking to the petrified wood house and around the whole long logs loop). That said, it's spectacular and well worth the walk! There are massive petrified logs all around you."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Long Logs Loop,Nature & Wildlife Areas,5.0,Our favorite trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is about a two mile trail on an old road.

Very cool.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"You should combine this with the Agate House for the best experience.  I was a bit surprised that their wasn't parking at the trailhead, so we had to drive back the short distance to the large parking area near the picnic area at the Rainbow Forest Museum.  It is a bit of a hoof from the trailhead to where the long longs really begin, but a very nice trail.  We skipped the last loop of the trail in order to go to Agate House as we were running short of time.  I would say this was my least favorite petrified wood hike in the park, but still fascinating."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Long Logs Loop,Nature & Wildlife Areas,5.0,Once in a lifetime sight,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Seeing the petrified forest and the wood scattered around it is amazing.

It is like viewing old prehistoric artwork where you don't focus on how rudimentary it is but instead look at it and become wowed by the fact that people, just living their lived some thousands of years ago, made these symbols and they are still there now. Go see this while you are there even just for a bit."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Newspaper Rock,Points of Interest & Landmarks,4.5,Untouched.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We seen a lot of petroglyphs.  Most have been scared by previous visitors.  This location seems a bit more untouched.  One can't as close as other petroglyphs so maybe that's why they are nice to view.  A pair of binoculars helps although the rocks aren't too far away.  It's a quick stop on the way through the Petrified Forest and even if you are limited in the time you can stay, this should be on your list of stops."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Devil's Playground,Deserts,4.5,Ask if there is still a permit available,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"They only give out 3 permits per week on a first come basis. Was very surprised permit was available on Easter weekend. Have to drive up interstate a few miles and drive on a dirt road. NPS directions were a little vague to find trailhead after you park car. Just go across the very large wash and near the dirt road opposite of where you park and then you will see the NPS trail markers. Once you find the trail head it is very easy to follow trail. A few ups and downs but mostly flat. Take plenty of water, no shade entire hike. Took us about 3 hours including spending time at the playground. Petrified Forest is awesome but mostly has short 15 minute loops. This hike is really worth it if you have the time and a permit is available. Obviously you will have the whole place to yourself which really adds to the experience. Also lots of Petrified wood to look at near the playground"

Our favorite was the Crystal Forest Trail as the amount of petrified logs and the colors of the stone are so fascinating to see.   The colors are like opening a crayon box (see pic below).   The trail at this stop was easy but there is no shade (like most of the park) so be prepared if the temps are hot.   But this was so worth the stop!!"

Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rainbow Forest,Forests,4.5,A Rainbow Of Stone Wood,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The scenic drive through the Rainbow Forest contains large, colorful petrified wood over 200 million years old - large pieces of tree trunks, even whole trunks - scattered all over the ground with a backdrop of white,  pink and red colored peaks and mesas. The scenic drive begins at the Southern entrance in the Painted Desert and continues through the Rainbow Petrified Forest or vice versa when doing the drive in reverse. After touring the 5 Big Canyons in Utah and the Grand Canyon in October 2016, the Rainbow Forest is a bit more subdued but no less interesting geologically or no less colorful. The landscape is somewhat lunar in places and the wood turned to multi-colored stone doesn't cease to amaze. It's possible to examine the petrified wood up close in certain places but it's not allowed to wander off the designated pathways or trails."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rainbow Forest,Forests,4.5,Come if you have never seen Petrified wood,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited Petrified Forest National Park in Mid-May.  This is something you should do if you have never seen petrified wood before, otherwise it might not be worth the trip.  You can do this park and the Painted Dessert in half a day.  The down side is the park makes you feel like a criminal as soon as you get there.  Signs everywhere announcing fines.  While I understand the need to protect the remaining petrified wood from being taken, I do not agree with their draconian methods.  This place has more rules than a prison camp.  They encourage you to call in to report other visitors and they even have a, rarely open, vehicle inspection station with signs warning it is ahead."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rainbow Forest,Forests,4.5,What You Need to See When You Stop Is....,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Painted Desert Wilderness area. I live near the Petrified Forest National Park and have made many visits. Interstate 40 actually passes through the Park and therefore ff you are traveling through on Interstate 40 you can easily jump off the interstate and right into the park. The visitor center there is worth a quick stop, but there is more interesting things to see if you just go a little farther. The Painted Desert Inn was a Route 66 hotel, but is now an interesting visitor center. If you hike, there is a trail head there at the Painted Desert Inn that takes you down into the Painted Desert Wilderness area. You stay on a trail for about 1/2 mile, but then once you are down in the valley, you are free to roam whereever you want to off the trail. And the petrified wood down there is gorgeous! It is black and you will not see it anywhere else in the park. Enjoy, and just remember to take plenty of water for the 1/2 mile climb back up the trail."

Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rainbow Forest,Forests,4.5,The geography is as interesting as the petrified logs,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Maybe it should have been more apparent to me, but The Petrified Forests of Arizona are not forests but scattered petrified logs strewn about what is now a desert. They are worth seeing butif you are on I-40, it take a couple of hours....although it could have just seemed that way."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rainbow Forest,Forests,4.5,Really Disappointing,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I really had high expectations of this place as most American national parks are quite spectacular. This one was the exception. Basically it's a 28 mile drive past various lookouts and easy to navigate trails.  At the risk of sounding negative, once you've seen a piece of petrified wood, you've seen it. I suppose it didn't help that it was a very cold day with high winds, making walking unpleasant. Perhaps on a warm summers day, the experience would be different."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Rainbow Forest,Forests,4.5,Triassic Treasures,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"When you get to the Rainbow Forest close your eyes and imagine that you are standing very close to the equator on the giant continent of Pangea. Rivers, streams and marshes predominate the landscape. Giant conifers and horsetails are everywhere. Dinosaurs, early reptiles and especially crocodillian ancestors like phytosaurs abound. Now realize that you are in the Rainbow Forest some 225,000,000 years ago. Today you can see examples of those ancient conifers in petrified wood along a paved 4/10ths of a mile Giant Log Trail. Old faithful is the largest of these conifers. Other petrified trees are also spread along the trail. Most are of the Aravcarioxylum arizonium species. Occassional lizards bask in the sun and a diveregent path will take you to the Agate House ( a partially restored pueblo of petrified wood) is only .5 mile from the main trail. There is no shade and the terrian is modestly hilly. The Rainbow Forest Museum offers park maps, Blue Mesa ecology exhibit which includes a mural depicting Late Triassic Life. It's detailed and sets a frame around what you are seeing on the Giant Log Trial and what you would have seen 225,000,000 years ago. Listen to the ranger tour, and buy a few light snacks during the busy season. The museum, Giant log Trail and Agate House is a short distance from the South Gate entrance. Without a pass, it is $5 for vehicle load. The whole park (Painted Desert, Blue Mesa and Crystal Forest and Rainbow Forest, etc.)  is 28 mile road.. With stops it can be done in a half day. They do check for stolen petrified wood at the entrance gates and people are toldto report anyone seen stealing petrified wood."

Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Blue Mesa,Hiking Trails,5.0,"Quiet, pretty trail",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is paved the entire way. It starts by going downhill, then when you get down to the Mesa you will start on a loop. There is lots of petrified wood around. There are a few signs that offer information about the rock formations around. At the end you go up again back to the parking lot. There is no sign by the road that says “Blue Mesa Trail” so you need to know where you’re going. There is a small wall with a stairway where you park for this trail. "

This trail is a 1 mile paved trail with 108 feet elevation gain.  It took us 30 minutes to complete and there is some uphill and downhill.  We visited Petrified Forest on Saturday, October 23.  If you are up for more adventure and would like a hike with very few people, consider the Historic Blue Forest Trail.  You can find this trail on AllTrails.

My wife and I only had about a half day to visit, so one of the decisions that faced us was whether or not we should venture off the main road to see Blue Mesa.  We ended up deciding to do so, and we’re glad we did.  You can reach Blue Mesa via a spur road about halfway through the park; it’s about a 5 mi/8 km round trip."

As you walk the trail, you descend into another world. I have never seen anything like it. This was our first hike in the park. Afterwards, we hiked the Crystal Forest and Logs. Those trails had more petrified wood but did not have the other-worldly landscape."

What an incredible place with magnificent scenery.  When we visited we were able to stop at each of the pull-offs to get better views of everything.  We were very lucky that at the time of the year when we made our visit, there were only a small number of visitors, hence it made for the most pleasurable visit.  We highly recommend to all who are in the area, make a visit to the Painted Desert, you'll be very glad you did."

When you first see it, you are just amazed at the beauty that sits in the middle of this park. It is a desert that dates back millions of years and the fact that only a small portion of the Painted Desert can be seen is still amazing; the natural colors and the many shapes give it its beauty. Although, the Painted Desert is just a small part of the park it still is worth stopping to view it and every picture taken is perfect."

Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Painted Desert,Deserts,4.5,Incredible!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I had no idea a place like this existed. Someone at work show me pictures but down played the beauty so, I decided to check it out for myself. The Painted Desert is apart of the Petrified Forest National Park. And it spans for miles. Enter through the visitors center entrance and on your first stop get ready to be amazed. The beauty of this park is never ending from the Painted Desert to the Blue Mesa you will not be disappointed. Although, the park rangers say the drive is about 2hrs but, I personally spent 7hrs there only cause I did not want to miss anything and I just could not get enough of the beauty that every photo I took was always the best one. From the Painted Desert to the Tepe Rocks to the Crystal Forest all beautiful! My plan is to return very soon to do it all again. This trip was great only cause the desert temperature was perfect 81 degrees and it made the drive pleasant. Make sure to take water with you (cause it is a desert) and always stay on the paths for safety. All stops have a small hike to enjoy the beauty of this park up close. Enjoy, your visit to the park."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Painted Desert,Deserts,4.5,"Beautiful, even on a rainy, windy day",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well worth the drive to see. If you go in the North entrance, be sure to stop at the Visitor Center before paying to go in to the park as you can’t get back to it without exiting the park. We didn’t do that so I can’t comment on the visitor center. The park road is about 28 miles to the south entrance. You can either exit the park there or turn around and drive the road back to the north entrance. (of course you can do it south to north if you prefer). The north entrance is right of I-40. The south entrance is about 20 miles south of Holbrook. There are numerous pullouts for views along the way. The Painted Desert Inn museum was nice. There were some beautiful features inside and you could peek in the windows of some of the old guest rooms. There wasn’t much at the Puerco Pueblo ruins but there were quite a number of petroglyphs in the area. At the Newspaper Rock petroglyph pull off it was hard to see them as they are down a hill. They did have telescopes to look through however. The Blue Mesa Loop drive is worth taking. There is a trail there as well which we didn’t take as it was raining. There are other pullouts/trails that take you close to the petrified wood. There is also a visitor center at the south end."

Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Painted Desert,Deserts,4.5,Long ugly drive to get there.  Still ugly once you arrive. Waste of time.,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Drove 5 hours round trip only to find the country’s ugliest national park.  The petrified wood is interesting and the landscape is scenic in its own so ugly it’s interesting way.  The visitor center was a lot about dinosaurs and not much about the park.  Overall the only high point is I can say I’ve been there.  Other than that it was a waste of gas and time. My wife and I both looked at each other and said, “How did this make it as a national park”?    My guess is it is covering some natural resources that the government wanted to protect (other than petrified wood).  The good reviews here just baffle me. I’ve been to a lot of national parks and this one is at the very bottom of the list."
Petrified Forest National Park,Arizona (AZ),Painted Desert,Deserts,4.5,One Review for the Whole Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We spent about 2 hours here driving through Petrified Forest National Park and stopping at the overlooks and walking a few trails.  This was a very enjoyable visit and we were so glad we chose to stop here on our Southwest trip.  They are doing some work on the Visitor Center and have signs directing you where to go.  There are several gift shops in the park area and a small eatery at the Painted Desert Visitor Center at the north entrance.  There is also a gas station here.  It was all very enjoyable so I am writing just one review for the park as a whole.  Highly recommend a visit here just to see things you cannot see many other places.

The park road just beyond Blue Mesa is closed due to construction.  You can see the first 16 miles before needing to turn around and head back.  Seeing the park from north to south gives you the painted desert viewpoints, the historic painted desert inn,  route 66 site, pueblo dwellings, newspaper rock, blue mesa, and petrified logs ... nice variety and  all great to see!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Kalaloch Beach Trail 4,Hiking Trails,5.0,Incredible tide pools!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We checked the tides and went at low tide on a foggy morning. Lots of parking available. The trail to the beach was easy to navigate but there were some large rocks at the end that you have to climb over to reach the beach. There's a rope to assist with the climb down for those who need it. The tide pools were AMAZING! Lots of orange and purple sea stars, different colored anemones, sea urchins, crabs, fish, etc. We found the best pools were down the beach to the right of the bridge. So glad we went!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Kalaloch Beach Trail 4,Hiking Trails,5.0,The driftwood made it feel whimsical,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We came down from the lodge in the early morning and the sky was gorgeous. Much nicer than the night before so we were happy with that. The beach is gorgeous but it was chilly at the time. The driftwood was really pretty along the sand and made everything feel whimsical. We really enjoyed this morning beach stroll
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Kalaloch Beach Trail 4,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing tide pools!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We hadn't planned to stop here until the ranger recommended it and we're so glad we did.  The marine life in the tide pools was incredible!  You have to check the tide schedules and go at low tide.  We also saw a whale spouting not too far off shore. Great experience!
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Kalaloch Beach Trail 4,Hiking Trails,5.0,Cliff Climbing Required,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"When I read the review of this beach it said “steep ascent” - yeah steep ascent if you mean you better be prepared to climb down some rocky cliffs.  This hike is totally out of the reach of anyone who is too young, too old or too concerned about falling or twisting and ankle or knee.  We would not have hiked down the steeply slanting trail and two sets of stairs if we had known we would not be able to get down to the beach and tidal pools.  The trail ends at on a stack of rocks 30-40 feet high and you'll need both hands and feet to get down them.  Our 40 year old son went down and spent almost an hour climbing the sea stacks and taking photos of marine creatures.  The beach is on the small side with not much in the way of drift logs and only one spine of sea stacks.  Tidal pool creatures were not very varied, our son said, and were mostly accessible if you climbed the sea stacks to the ocean side.  We’ve all seen more diversity and more accessibility at 2nd Beach up the coast.  So if you’re in the vicinity and adventurous, try Beach 4.  If not, give it a miss."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Kalaloch Beach Trail 4,Hiking Trails,5.0,Worth the effort!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We stayed one night at Kalaloch Lodge within Olympic National Park. If you're into seeing sea life, then most interesting time to go to Beach 4 is just before and during and just after low tide. The natural rock formations create tidal pools where you are almost guaranteed to see green anemones and orange and purple starfish (sea stars). These would not be visible during other phases of the tide. "

Mushrooms everywhere in October. Look for them, you can’t miss them!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Kalaloch Beach Trail 4,Hiking Trails,5.0,Really fun beach for hiking and for searching tidal pools,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We almost missed out on Beach 4 because our hiking book didn't say much about it other than it was next to Beach 3. The front desk attendance at the Kalaloch Lodge directed us to Beach 4 for tidal pool observation. There is a rocky area towards the north end of the beach with super tidal pools full of green anemones and many brightly colored sea stars as well as lots of shelled critters. Definitely try to get there at low tide to maximize the views in the pools because once the tide starts to come back in these get covered quickly. We also just strolled the beach for a couple of miles and it is very peaceful. Entry onto the beach was kind of challenging, having to cross a bridge made of driftwood and a descent down a large rock abutment. It was doable but watch your steps! We are so glad that we didn't miss this beach. It is a highlight."

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Olympic Peninsula Loop Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Underwhelming,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"After visiting Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier, the drive along the Olympic Peninsula Loop was rather underwhelming. Some parts were not very scenic.   The exceptions for scenery, though, were the views around Crescent Lake and Hurricane Ridge. The road was rough to drive in certain spots as cars would park on the side of the road. There are a few beaches to stop by, though, the Pacific is a wild ocean, so I'm not sure how good the views will be. You can do the loop in one day, though, it is a very long day."

As recommended as well as common sense will dictate, drive this loop in a counterclockwise direction.  I started from the junction of WA State Route 104 and U.S. Route 101 just south of Discovery Bay on the Olympic Peninsula.  On the way to Port Angeles, one could take detours to see Victorian architecture in the city of Port Townsend, lavender farms in Sequim, and one of your best chances in the world to find out what a sand spit is in the community of Dungeness."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Olympic Peninsula Loop Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Olympic National Park/Expansive and beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This summer my husband had work in Seattle.  My daughter who was home from college and done working for the summer  and I decided to go with and explore Seattle.  Once my husband was done with work, we set off for five days in the Olympic National Park.  I had read enough about the area to know that it was a large area with many different wonders to explore and that 5 days would really not be long enough.  So, we read about the different areas and voted on the sites/activities we wanted to do for those 5 days. Trip advisor reviews and forums were so helpful in choosing housing and things to do.   I already knew that there would be so many things that we would never see.  We spent the first day driving from Seattle and stopping along the way.  We took a ferry to Bainbridge.  The best place to eat in this town was Streamliner Diner.  It does not look like much on the outside, but the food was great.  We stopped later on the drive to Sequim at the town of Poulsbo.  A quaint town on the water with lots of great little shops.  We arrived in Sequim and stayed there at Karen's Guest Cottage.   [--] This cottage overlooked the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  It was beautiful to look out at the sunset and the water.  The cottage was clean and provided a great location for activities in the area.  Sequim is known for its lavender farms and they were beautiful.  Nearby was the Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge.  This is a 5.5 mile stretch of sand that in on the Strait that you can walk on.  The next day we went to Port Angeles and kayak with the group Adventures Through Kayaking in Freshwater Bay.  They were a great group to plan a trip with.  Lots of seals, etc. and great trip.  Morning is best to view wildlife.  Hiked in the afternoon at the Hurricane Ridge area.  It is a must.  You can drive up to the visitor's center and then hike if you want.  Wished we would have alloted more time to hike here.  Day three we went to Lake Crescent area and ate lunch at the lodge, hiked to Marymere falls, and took another hike on the northern end of the lake.  Marymere Falls is a must.  The next day we drove west on 112 toward Neah Bay.  This is a beautiful drive with alot of parks and stops along the way to view the Strait and the sea life.    Make sure you stop in the town of Joyce at The Blackberry CAfe.  Small, friendly cafe with the best homemade food.  Breakfast is served all the time.  Make sure you order a blueberry scone.  They are to die for.  Just before Neah Bay we pulled over to look at the sunset and saw whales close by.  We never made it to Neah Bay as it got to late and we needed to make it to our lodging that night.  Plan an entire day for that trip and to see the museum there.   We were really disappointed that we did not have enough time left to see Neah bay and the museum there.  We then headed south to Brightwater House near Forks.  Brightwater House is a bed and breakfast located on the Sol Duc River close to Rialto Beach.  They also have one cabin on the property.   The B&B was beautiful, clean, hosts were very friendly and accomodating, and many of the areas we wanted to visit were not far from there.  [--]-lodge  From the lodge we spent the next entire morning hiking Rialto Beach to Hole In The Wall area 1.5 miles north of the beach.  Tidepools, sea stacks, beach, water, not alot of people-just wilderness at its best.  We then went into Forks, ate lunch at local sports store deli (which was great homemade food), toured the town,  bought $12.00 rainduck  jackets and pants, and drove off south to the Hoh Rain Forest area.  Beautiful drive along the way.  Spent the afternoon in the rain forest hiking in the rain.  The suits made the hike fun.  Saw elk herds on the way out of the park area at closing time.  Headed back into Forks to eat supper and head to the B&B.  Word of caution--the restaurants are limited so you need to plan ahead.  We really needed an extra day to tour the other beaches south of Rialto like Ruby beach, etc.  Never made it to any other beaches as the next day we needed to drive back to Seattle.  We went to a baseball game that last night at SafeCo field.  Best ball park food selection I have ever seen at a ball park.  We had 5 days in the area, we saw and did alot of different activities.  However, there was so much more we wanted to see/experience that time did not allow.  We got out and explored the area and did not just drive through.  Will need to plan another trip to see the areas we missed.  Wonder if we will still have our college daughter along for the next part of the trip?  She loved the area and the activities."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Olympic Peninsula Loop Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,"Mountains, forests, and beaches",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Olympic Peninsula is one of our favorite vacation places for exploring natural beauty.  There are dozens of side trips off the main highway that will take you to wonderful places to visit and enjoy nature.  While it is physically possible to do the loop in one long day, you’ll only be able to see 2 or 3 sights and you’ll spend most of your time in your car.   Taking two days will let you add 2 or 3 more sights, and spending three or more nights will enable time to explore a wide range of activities.  Starting from Seattle and going counter clockwise, here are some of my favorite highlights:  "
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Olympic Peninsula Loop Drive,Scenic Drives,4.5,Inconvenient but totally worth it,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It is a 5-6 drive to drive around the park but you need to plan beforehand and decide which places you would stop and where you would want to get gas. There are a handful number of spots on the loop where you can get gas: Sequim, Port Angeles, Forks, Aberdeen, and there quite a few other places in the SouthEast. Some of these towns are 70-80 miles away so plan ahead. Also there are so many places to visit you will ideally need 3 days to visit all major attractions on the loop. I visited in April and it was raining almost all day, I would suggest carrying a jacket or windbreaker. Also, you will not find your regular chain restaurants on most of the loop other than in Forks and Port Angeles. My GPS surprisingly worked unlike what I have heard from other people who have visited the park. I would definitely use the map they provide you at checkin. Also the speed limit is around 60-65 on most of the loop and 35 around some attractions like lakes, etc. Drive comfortably because there are a lot of pull out locations all around the drive where you can get various different outlooks of places in the park. I visited Hoh Rainforest, Ruby Beach, Rialto Beach. I really wanted to visit Hurricane ridge but it snowed pretty hard on the April day I visited. 2 other places that are really good on the loop are Quinault rainforest, and Sul doc falls/hot springs. Look at the park website to look for any closures around the loop. Going to the park and completing the whole loop had been on my bucket list for quite a while. Even though it is really out of the way, time consuming and requires a very concrete plan to get the most of your visit - it is worth it! I have been to lots of state parks and a couple of national parks and olympic np is a cut above the rest. There are descriptions and each location giving you the history/background behind each park feature. You can go from snow clad mountain, to a beach, to a rainforest, to waterfalls and rivers all in the same day. I don't remember the last time I visited a place where I had to turn the heat on, switch to A/C, and turn the heat back in my car; all in the same day."

As you enter the beach, if you go to the left, you may be able to walk out to the rock further out. We saw this later, so did not go in case the tide came in. "

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Second Beach Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,One of Earth's best places,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is truly one of Earth's best places.  This place has deep soulful meaning to my wife and I.  It's in the top 5 best bang for your hiking effort buck locations anywhere.  I actually love the fact that it takes about 20 minutes from the parking lot to the beach. Otherwise, I think 1000's of people would be there every day even though its a pretty remote location.  I could sit and stare at the sea stacks for days.  A sunset at this beach can change your life, if you are lucky enough to have the weather cooperate to provide you a sunset, and the sunrises are as good if not better.  Don't fret the full parking lot, remote location, short hike, and frequently difficult weather, just go to this place.  If you were a 20 minute walk from the Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China, Pyramids, or Mt Rushmore would you stay in the car?  You shouldn't here either and this is better than all of those."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Second Beach Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,A must do while in ONP!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We went here last week while in ONP. We arrived just over an hour before low tide which was perfect. The hike through the forest is another beautiful ONP hike. The fun part is when you pass through the trees and see the pile of driftwood to climb over and the beautiful beach and seastacks. Amazing view! Our day started cloudy with rain in the forecast but apparently that is true of most days there. As we reached the beach the sun came out and we had awesome weather. We visited the tidepools and saw a variety of anemone.  We live near the Atlantic but this was a beautiful beach not to be missed!
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Second Beach Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Don't get the love for this place!,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"There were a lot of reviews that absolutely raved about this Beach, even some of the locals recommended it as their favorite.  One place (AAA tourbook? Don't remember) said it was .8 mile hike ""mostly level with some stairs at the end"".  Wow.  In whose universe?  Maybe athletic 20-somethings!  Yes, we're in our early 60's but we go to the gym 3x/wk, walk the dog 2 miles every day and yes we'd already hiked the Hall of Mosses Trail in the Hoh Rainforest and down to Ruby Beach before we hit this.  BUT STILL the trail was up hill, down dale over rocks and roots with a steep descent on giant steps and a logjam obstacle course at the end!  Yes it's a beautiful beach which is the only reason I don't give it a ""terrible"" review.  WORSE YET was the single unspeakably NASTY port-a-potty with no paper and no sanitizer in the parking lot at the head of the trail.  Not to mention that the parking lot was mobbed and the overflow parking was up yet another hill some distance away  Then nearly a mile hike back, all uphill.  Ruby Beach was so much better - shorter hike & really nice facilities, just less parking."

A bit of a drive once you Pay the fee for national park ($30/day or $80/yr) until you get to the parking lot for the falls hike. There are several hikes for all age groups. We took the one to the falls just over 1.5 miles each way, with a 2 & 7 year old who navigated the whole thing both ways. So much lush green things to see! Perfect place to scavenger hunt for nature. (Of course only for sight not touching or taking) The falls are so beautiful! It is a bit loud close to the falls (on the bridge over the falls). As you walk farther down the river the noise becomes nature. The rocks, water, moss, trees, everything is so amazing. Wonderful place to take photos and explore the nature of a rainforest in WA state. Highly recommend !! "

Just past the Sol Duc Hot Springs, the mostly level trail winds through the forest along a creek.   While most of the trails is well groomed, there are a few spots with roots and rocks to navigate, but easy enough to do in tennis shoes.  At about 3/4 mile, you are rewarded with views of the falls plunging into a slot canyon.   The forest is cool an lush.   This is a well traveled trail, so you will meet plenty of people along the way.  During our hike most people we masked up for COVID when they passed people.   "

It is the uniqueness of the waterfall that really makes this a quality attraction in the park.  The hike is relatively easy through a beautiful, mature forest but no real significance until the falls.  Rather than a cliff face drop, like Marymere, here the landscape in the forest is level with a fissure in the rock that drops to the create a sideways fall.  You can look at the pictures, but this is one you really have to visit to see in person.  It is the unusual nature of the falls that makes this a great attraction for Olympic and one I recommend.  "

Then back to the lodge for a quick change into bathing suits and we tried each of the pools. My husband even went into the regular swimming pool with is very cool. ,Life guard is on duty and he answered questions about the water source etc, Had a picnic lunch outside at a table near the cabins and purchased beverages in the lodge entrance."

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Sol Duc Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,Better Than Marymere,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you are pressed for time and can only pick one waterfall to visit, Sol Duc is the better experience than Marymere. Sol Duc is a little less crowded because it sits at the back of a few mile road off the main path and it is behind a fee station. It is also a more visually appealing waterfall. Pictures don't really capture the views you'll get in real life. It is a high volume waterfall and cuts a uniquely narrow chasm from the falls. Marymere is a more conventional looking falls, but you probably haven't seen many quite like Sol Duc. You'll also find a few other trails to explore and a hot springs resort."

Allow yourself lots of time, wear comfortable shoes, bring a bottle of water, and enjoy your day."

We hike many National parks, including Yellowstone last year. The thing to remember with Olympic National Park is the trails have VERY few trail markers. If you're on a 6 mile path you may not see a trailmarker for 4 miles.  Have a good map, GPS etc Wear comfortable shoes,  bring water and a snack. Good luck! "
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Olympic National Forest,Forests,5.0,Great hiking and waterfalls.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved the park and the surrounding areas. Bring your hiking boots!  Tons of trails, waterfalls, lakes and beautiful forests. Some pretty coastline as well. Cute towns here and there but mostly a place to explore nature. Give yourself three days at least."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Olympic National Forest,Forests,5.0,Super Beautiful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We loved going to Olympic National Park. We had the best time in the Hoh Rainforest and hiking those trails. I would definitely go again to explore more of the Olympic National Park. We took so many awesome photos there.

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Olympic National Forest,Forests,5.0,EAST side of Olympic Nat'l Park/Forest - WOW!!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"After numerous trips to the west, north, and east sides of Olympic National Park over the years,  the EAST side along Hood Canal receives our vote for the most to offer for  the Olympic Nat'l Park and Forest region for many reasons.  The views of Puget Sound, Rainier, downtown Seattle, the Olympics and Cascades are unlike anything we've seen in our world travels. Truly breathtaking with Mt Rainier in all its glory. Hood Canal is loaded with fantastic seafood such as crab, shrimp, oysters, clams, and geoduck (look up a photo of a geoduck!).  Fabulous finds in the way of restaurants in the Brinnon area, along with amazing hiking, kayaking, wineries, distilleries, swimming without the worry of an under tow, and wildlife like no where else we've been on the water of Hood Canal. especially near Dosewallips State Park. This area is also waterfall heaven!!  NOTE: Olympic Natl Park does NOT allow dogs, and they will turn you away if attempting to enter with a dog.  Olympic Nat'l Forest DOES allow dogs, so if bringing a canine family member Olympic National Forest is much more easily accessible than north and west sides from our experience.  It's also SO much closer to Seattle and Tacoma.  Not much in the way of hotels, but some vacation rentals available under Olympic National Park on TripAdvisor. I hope you have as much fun and amazing relaxation as we've had, as it is definitely not to miss!!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Quinault Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Must have missed something...,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"We took the road on the southern side of the lake and it was much more developed than the northern side.  We drove down to where there is a small parking lot on the right for the ""World's Largest Sitka Spruce.""  It was a short walk to a gigantic tree with a short description.  Then we drove back to the main road and drove on part of the northern side but it's pretty much 100% residential, with no trace of things to do for people visiting."

It was wonderful!  The rain gave a memorable atmosphere to the trees, moss, streams, waterfalls, wildlife,band birds.  The rain brought out subtle colors.  Plus we had the tour guide Paul to ourselves, and there was hardly anyone else around.  Paul was very knowledgeable about the area, its history and creatures.  Also Paul was very attentive and accommodating.  We had a wonderful, memorable tour."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Quinault Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Peaceful and not crowded,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Quinault Rain forest was beautiful and not crowded the day we visited. Wanted to visit the High Rain forest but it was so rainy the day we wanted to visit so we thought we would settle for Quinault. Well we were not disappointed with our visit! It was so awesome and very few people were there. We felt like we were in Jurassic park and were waiting for the dinosaurs to come walking out! Saw a couple of banana slugs and some folks that we passed said a bear crossed in front of them. Unfortunately, we didn't see it!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Quinault Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Nice quiet trail trough the rain forest,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is a nice quiet trail into the rain forest. This place is located further from other more frequented place ad therefore is a lot more quiet. The main trial is fairly easy and can be completed in  a short period of time.
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Quinault Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Great Alternative to HOH,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We opted to try Quinault instead of HOH and were not disappointed.  I would recommend the Maple Glade/Kestner Homestead trails.  Completely flat, easy hikes, where you feel transported to another place.  We arrived on a Friday morning at 9:39am and had the trails to ourselves.  Nearby, I would also stop at the July Creek Picnic Area.  There are some large fallen trees there and a great view of the lake."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Quinault Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Easy Hiking,4.0 of 5 bubbles,It's worth a stop over to hike some of the short trails.  Most of them seem to be loops following the stream.  Thick vegetation and so green.  Hikes are easy but not handicap accessible.  Parking is available at the trailheads.

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Quinault Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Loved!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I will be going back! I loved this place. Very easy to navigate through places and not horribly crowded. We took a few short trails around and enjoyed the beautiful scenery. The Rangers were very knowledgable and helpful. If you are a hiker you do not want to miss this place! 
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Quinault Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Not worth the detour,2.0 of 5 bubbles,I found this to be a total waste of time. The scenery is not much different than you see from any other highway in the area. The ranger station was also closed in the middle of the day in the middle of the week. Restrooms were available with running water and very clean.
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Quinault Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,A quiet place compared to others in the area.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We parked at the small visitors center and it was closed that day.  We took the noted trail and really enjoyed the views in this second temperate rain forest.  Also a great view across the meadow with huge broad leaf trees.  We did not circle the lake as we wanted to visit the historic lodge.  Take you time of this road
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,Didn't know what to expect.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Got up early turned west out of Port Angeles, headed for the Pacific Coast. Had my heart and mind on that coastline. I had no idea that one of the most beautiful sights I'd see that day would be this incredibly tranquil lake. And I got to see it from so many different viewpoints on the drive! So lovely, so in awe I was just standing on the shore watching the wisps of the morning getting airborne. One of my favorite spots from my trip to the Great Northwest."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,Good place for relaxation,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Lake Crescent was one of the highlights in Olympic National Park even travelling time from Seattle was quite long.  The lake was tranquil but had fabulous view with beautiful trees and gorgeous surrounding mountains and the water was clean and clear.  Good place for relaxation.  Highly recommended on it.
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful Lake,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We thought it would be fun to kayak here and I called the lodge to make a reservations.  We were told it was first come first served and that kayaks were nothing special and did not offer good back rests.  AS we are in our late 70's we decided to pass.  Later when we visited the lodge and lake we saw only a few kayaks and it was very windy on the lake..  Glad we passed on this one.  However exploring the various parts of the lake is worth the drive as this is a very large lake with cool clear water.  
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,Lots of Good Hiking Around a Stunning Lake,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I visited Lake Crescent as part of a West Coast trip we did, which included hiking Olympic National Park. Lake Crescent is so beautiful and expansive. We drove around it and stopped for some hiking including the Marymere Falls Trail, which was an easy trail that wasn't long but gave us plenty of trail to enjoy all of the greenery, the creek, and the falls. I would definitely recommend stopping at Lake Crescent as part of your Olympic National Park visit!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,GORGEOUS!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I love crystal clear glacial lakes, and this one didn't disappoint. Plenty of recreation room, peaceful, massive, beauty from every angle. My youngest son braved the freezing waters for about a half hour, my oldest said it was too cold.

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,Beautiful Lake Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We spent an amazing couple of hours at Crescent Lake. It's a beautiful drive around the lake with lots of pull-offs for taking in the view. We parked at the Crescent Lake Lodge and walked around and then hiked the trail to Marymere Falls, which was stunning. The giant trees and then the beautiful waterfalls made the hike worthwhile. The trail was very well maintained and clearly marked and not too difficult."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,"Deep blue lake, scenic drive, and hikes",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We always enjoy the scenic winding drive along the south shore of the lake.   There are spots to pull off the road to enjoy views of the lake surrounded by forested mountains.  When the sun is out, the lake is a deep blue color.  About halfway along the southern shore is Lake Cresent Lodge with cabins, restaurant, and beach area with canoe and kayak rentals.  This also the starting point for the beautiful easy hike to Marymere Falls.  "
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,It feels like you're in the Alps,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We had the good fortune to spend time in Halstatt, Austria, the lakeside town which was the homeland of the Celts.  It absolutely blew us away how much Lake Crescent reminded us of it.  This large lake, lined by the road on one side, beckoned us to spend time on the shore, just staring at it, taking in the silence.  Being from drought-stricken California, it filled our souls to be near someplace with so much fresh water."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Lake Crescent,Bodies of Water,4.5,Great,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beautiful lake, it take long time to drive around it, road is windy and you can observe the lake from all points. There are multiply stops along the lake so you can enjoy the view. There is a hike nearby, people swimming in boats. It is a nice spot to go one vacation."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hurricane Ridge,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Spectacular Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The weather is so unpredictable here, even in the summer. We lucked out, warm, clear skies! Lots of hiking on paved and well-maintained gravel trails. Lots of wildlife. The park rangers do a great job. There's construction happening at the HR visitor's center, but you can still drive through to Hurricane Hill trailhead. "
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hurricane Ridge,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Beautiful hike.  Go early.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We wanted to avoid the crowds.   We have 5 kids and they love it when we drag them out of bed at the crack of dawn on vacation!    They grumble a bit at first but they are always thrilled when we have some peace and tranquility.     We arrived in the park at 8 am on a Tuesday.    We recommend driving past the visitor center about 1 mile and go straight to the parking lot on hurricane hill.  It is a small parking lot (about 30 cars with an overflow lot down the hill)  that fills quickly.   When we arrived by 8:30 it was about half full.   Between the visitor center and the hurricane hill lot we saw a black bear and several deer along the road.    We hiked to the top of hurricane hill (5 kids age 8-18).  The hike is about 3 miles round trip and it is fully paved (a few small unpaved paths you can wander on).   The last part on the way up is a bit of a challenge.   We needed to stop for a few breaks.   The mosquitoes were heavy and swarmed you when we stood still and as we walked.    We tried to avoid using it but after about 15 minutes we were covered in mosquitoes.  Bring bug spray!!!   The paved path was nice but I prefer unpaved paths to make it feel more natural.    I guess it was recently paved.   We finished the hike in about 2 hours and it never felt very crowded.   Probably my second favorite hike ever, after the hike to Hidden Lake in Glacier."

There are several viewpoints along the way and a few tunnels too.  A large parking area is the staring point for several trails along the ridge.  The trails near the visitor center are paved, then turn into regular dirt trails as you move out of the area.   We hiked the Klahhane Ridge trail to a viewpoint with views in all directions. "

It is a long, slow drive up the visitor's center. As the visitor's center parking was nearly full, they were slowing us up at the entrance which made the wait about 30 minutes. The view from the visitor's center offers you stunning views of the Olympic mountain range. Restrooms and gift shop were open at the visitor's center."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hurricane Ridge,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Beautiful views & wildlife!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hurricane Ridge was our first stop on our few days at Olympic National Park and we arrived in the late afternoon. We were thrilled that the gift shop was actually open (as so many in our national parks aren't yet). We shopped a bit and hiked a few of the shorter trails. It was incredible that from one area of the park you could see mountains and glaciers on one side and gorgeous views of the Strait Juan de Fuca on the other. We saw lots of wildlife, including a ton of deer and a few marmots, which was exciting! The deer weren't scared at all and wandered right into the parking lots and mingled with the cars. Even the drive up to the top were beautiful!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hurricane Ridge,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Wonderful views on the hurricane hill trail,5.0 of 5 bubbles,One of the highlights at Olympic National Park. We did the hurricane hill trail which provides excellent views of the ridge. The trail is uphill but is completely paved so it's not too difficult. There are amazing views of the ridge and on a clear day you can see the city of Port Angeles and beyond that to Canada. There are also marmots and deer you can spot along the trail.

However, for me, this was my favorite place to visit in Olympic, simply amazing.  We hiked here on our last morning of the group trip.

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hurricane Ridge,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Terrible experience,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Travelled far to get there only to find d out that the park had reached its daily limit of 375 cars.  The daily limit is usually reached at 10 am forest ranger Jane-doe told us.  We only wanted to drive up to the top to take a photo as there is nothingbup there to do.  The center at the top burned down so there are no washrooms or food or drink available.  It would have been nice if the park rangers could figure out how to advertise tgat there park closes down to the public around 10am each day.  Extremely disappointed to have traveled all the way there to be rejected at the gate.  Its unfortunate they cant figure out how to keep the park open to everyone while they rebuild washrooms.  That is alotvof revenue that they are losingveach day. Revenue tgat could be used to fund the building of new washrooms.  Too bad no one in charge can figure that out. We will not be returning and we will be sure to share this terrible experience with everyone we know.
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hurricane Ridge,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Worth going to! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Worth going to! The hike up the trail isn't too steep (if I can do it, most likely you can too). While we were on top of the first ridge my phone ""Welcomed me to Canada"". Lol. That's right! You can see Canada from the top of the trail. "
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,One of the great diverse areas of Olympic National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is something you just have to see.  You would not expect this in the Northern United States.  The trails are easy to walk and anyone could do them.  The different things you can see and the way the trees grow with all the moss and ferns is amazing.  If I can make one recommendation go very early.  This is a one road in one road out place with very limited parking.  We went early and spend the entire morning walking around.  We saw some elk and even found a couple different slugs.  But if you don't go early you could be waiting in line for hours because as a certain point they will only let a car in if a car comes out.   Don't miss it but go early.
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Enchanting experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We loved walking through the Hall of Mosses. Beautiful drive getting to the parking area and only a short walk to the trails which are to the right of the visitors center, which isn’t open due to Covid. Restrooms are open. There were a lot of people, but most wore masks and gave each other space on the one way trails. Only the Olympic National Park $30 entrance fee. If you’re going to Mt. Ranier National Park also, you may want to get the $80 pass that gets you and anyone with you in for free at any national park nationwide for a year from your purchase date."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Couldn't get in,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"As I approached the entrance, I was stopped by a line of vehicles that stretched further than I could see.

So, I left."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Not sure it was worth the wait to get into the park,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Although I would recommend coming to the rainforest, the wait outside the park was really long! When I got there I spent about an hour walking along some of the trails and then left. Unless you’re going to go for long hikes within the forest, it’s really not worth the long line. It’s just OK."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Just beautiful,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We did the Hall of Mosses Nature Trail 0.8 mile loop.  It was a very easy and very beautiful hike.  We were there in late September in a drought year and it was still fantastically beautiful.  You can imagine in a forest with everything covered with moss.  Check out the attached photo.
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Wow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Unfortunately it was a three hour drive from hurricane ridge and with construction it was closer to 4 hours.   We made it and we’re not disappointed.  We took the spruce trail.    It was an easy 1.8 mile loop.   The signs throughout explained the forest.    The river was a slice of heaven.   I don’t want to leave.   I could have spend hours.    You need at least a day to explore this area fully.     Just beautiful.  I’ve never seen the kind of beauty the Pacific Northwest has to offer.  Plan to spend some time here.  2 hours just wasn’t enough.
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Olympic but not a winner in multiple areas,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the most interesting part of the park. Was it worth traveling 2,000+ miles to see during a week of endless rain? Debatable. Olympic National Park is not easy to get around. So you are forced to literally go to one site a day due to the lack of connecting roads. Major areas of the park are not upgraded and offer little interpretive information compared to other Canadian and US properties. Antiquated is not the right word—beat up, sparse and lacking investment are the best words to describe Olympic. There are so many sites that are more accessible and offer more bang for your buck in North America. Really look at other park options before making the trek out to the West Coast."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Tolkien’s magical world in real life,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got there at 1pm on June 22nd. After 1 hour of waiting in line, which was fine and expected, we found parking easily and headed to the Hall of Mosses for some magical views. There’s a lot to see here, and it’s definitely worth it for the magically fuzzy redwood trees. Take any detours along the trail that you see, they do have an end to them shortly and usually it’s something amazing. "
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Greenest Section of Olympic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hoh Rainforest is one of the longest detours from route 101 in the national park, but is well worth it. I got there early in the morning, so parking was not an issue, but it appears parking can be a nightmare during busy times. I'd suggest shooting for an early arrival. I did the Hall of Mosses and Spruce Nature Trails on my visit. The Hall of Mosses is a hike through some of the older growth forest. I saw some elk near the path during the early hours. The Spruce Nature Trail is definitely worth doing as well and shows folks some of the newer growth by the river. This was my second favorite area of the park behind Rialto Beach and should be on any Olympic itinerary. You don't have to stay too long as you can get those two hikes done in a pretty short amount of time. There are some longer hikes, but I didn't have the time to venture out."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Hoh Rain Forest,Forests,4.5,Not A Single Ewok In Sight ,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"The kids said Hoh Rainforest was like walking through Endor, without Ewoks.

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Parking was DIFFICULT,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were driving from Astoria Oregon to Port Angeles on Thursday, 7/29 and wanted to stop at Rialto Beach along the way.  Because we also visited Ruby Beach before that, by the time we reached the parking lot for Rialto Beach, it was around 11:00 am and boy was it PACKED.  They have an overflow lot that we went into.  It was sketchy with large rocks and there were no spots.  So we went back to the main lot.  We waited behind a couple of cars that essentially were waiting for a car to pull out.  It took us around 30 minutes before someone left and we were able to get a spot."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Must see sunset,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sunsets are a must. We walked the 1.5 mile to the hole in the rock and it was completely worth it. Tons of amazing pictures were taken from so many angles. After sunset at 9:20, it was just as pretty walking back and at 10 it was still bright enough to see. Best part was all the otters grabbing dinner at the waters edge!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Highlight of Olympic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You might think that if the weather is not nice, a trip to the beach would be a bad choice, but the opposite was true for us.  We went in the evening, hoping to watch a sunset, but the fog had already rolled in and there was no sun to be seen. But the fog combined with the enormous driftwood logs and pebble beach to create a surreal landscape that was AMAZING.  Giant sea rocks loomed offshore, and the fog created a quiet an intimacy to the scene that you would not otherwise find on the beach.  I'm sure this is a cool place on a nice day, but don't write it off because of the weather."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Leave This Stop for Late in the Day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The sunsets here are a highlight you won't want to miss.  Even if fog rolls in, this beach is exception.  The driftwood alone is gorgeous and the makeshift shelters have made from the driftwood are fun to explore.  The tide pools teem with sealife if you are fortunate to visit at low tides.  The sea stacks are gorgeous and you really should hike out to see the hole in the wall."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Probably my favorite beach in Olympic,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose to go early in the day to coincide with the tides and giving us the ability to visit the hole in the wall and stay for a while to explore.   The walk up the beach in the morning is peaceful.  With the exception of some overnight campers, we pretty much had the beach to ourselves.  We stopped at multiple places on the way up the beach to take pictures and do some tide pooling.  After reaching the hole in the wall we walked to the other side and did a lot of tide pooling and saw many starfish and anemones and crabs.   After spending some time at the hole we began to work our way back down the beach.  The tide started coming back in which made for a different experience walking back down the beach.  We spent most of the day here just exploring and enjoying the area.  Just an FYI around 9 - 10 while we were there people really started showing up so it got more croweded."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Fun for early low tide,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was probably my favorite thing to do at Olympic National Park.  Low tide was -2+ at 6:31 a.m. on Sunday, July 2nd.  We left our lodging in Port Angeles at 4:30 a.m.  It was an easy ride with very few other cars on the road at that time.  There were several cars in the lot at Rialto Beach when we arrived at 6 a.m.; however, there were still plenty of spots.  There were several other families making their way to the Hole in the Wall area.  Everyone was spread out and this felt like the least crowded thing that we did while at ONP.  I imagine that it would have been much more crowded if low tide had been later in the day.  We arrived at Hole in the Wall at 6:30 a.m.  We had so much fun searching the tide pools and taking pictures.  We wore hiking boots, which were appreciated.  Don't try to climb on the rocks in flipflops or sandals.  I definitely recommend a visit to Rialto Beach for low tide...and don't be afraid of an early low tide."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Rialto Beach,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I went here because the Chamber of Commerce recommended to go to this beach instead of Lapush. I went early in the morning so that I could see the hole in the wall before the current got too close. This literally took my breath away! It is so beautiful! It was a bit foggy, but it was still so gorgeous with the ocean and the beach and then right next to the gorgeous forest! It was just absolutely amazing! If you are in this area, this is a must see!  But even if you are not in the area, it is definitely worth the trip. To see the hole in the wall you have to get there at the right time, walk down the beach about an hour, you see it, and then you have to make sure you walk back in time before the tide comes in! Visit the Chamber of Commerce for the correct times. So beautiful!"
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Beautiful even on a rainy day,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The day we visited it was pouring rain. We simple put on our rain gear and kept going.

Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Rialto Beach,Beaches,4.5,Best Shoreline Experience in Olympic NP,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Olympic NP has several great beaches and trails.  However, for our group, the premier one to visit is Rialto Beach and the hike to the Hole in the Wall.  For me, Rialto is the stereotypical beach of the NW Pacific in the US.  It is a rock and pebble beach with forest and driftwood and large rock formations protruding from the ocean that fluctuates with the tides.  It is both cold but inviting with a sense of exploration as each step exposes something more unique.  There is also a lot of wildlife here, birds of all types and the most amazing experience with a seal swimming just offshore in the surf.  "

Finding a way over or through is your first challenge. The beach itself was nice, but again we had a misty/foggy day. Sun was trying to come out but never did.

Since it was early in the morning, we had no issues finding parking and it was quiet when we first got there.

The many rock formations erupting from the beach and the water would be perfect for the creepy atmosphere needed in that film.  The fact that the smoke and fog covered much of the landscape just added to the ethereal feeling. "
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Ruby Beach,Beaches,5.0,Stunning Beach and Rock Formations,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Ruby Beach is one of the prettiest beaches on the West Coast.  There's plenty of parking and you follow a walk path from the parking lot to the beach.  Go at low tide if you can time just right.  Several huge rock formations that are stunningly beautiful.  At low tide you can explore in the tide pools for sea creatures.  The beach is covered with drift wood that several visitors gather to make small structures that are fun to play around.  Millions of smooth rocks are everywhere.  Visitors like to make cairn statues that are on display to enjoy and photograph.  It was a bit overcast when we arrived but it cleared while we were exploring.  Worth the stop.
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Ruby Beach,Beaches,5.0,"Beautiful, rocky/pebbly beach",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ruby Beach is incredible. The beach is a pebbles and rocks polished smooth by time. The rocks are rich colors and mottled greys. It's generally easy hking with a few driftwood logs to cross along the way. We hiked to the Hole in the Wall but didn't try to access it as the tide was too high. Still, a beautiful and unique site. It rained, typical of the Pacific NW. One just puts on their raingear and keeps going. We didn't see ""ruby""--apparently it is best at sunset."
Olympic National Park,Washington (WA),Ruby Beach,Beaches,5.0,Beautiful and Peaceful,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"We got here pretty early in the morning and unfortunately, the tide was on its way in, so we weren't able to fully experience the rock pools.  That being said, this is a beautiful beach with lots of rock formations.   It is quite pebbly and there is tonnes of driftwood around which adds to the beauty.  It was too cold -and too early - to swim, but we enjoyed our short walk down to the beach and the time we spent there.   "

A nice little walk down to the beach not too long but can be a little taxing for some coming back up.    We walked the beach for about an hour and a half early in the morning.  By the time we were leaving so many people were coming onto the beach and into the parking lot.  If you really want to enjoy the beauty of this beach go early and avoid the crowds.  Either way, this is a must-stop and see in Olympic NP."
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Ladder Creek Falls,Waterfalls,4.5,"First Stop, Easy Walk",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you enter the North Cascades Highway from the Concrete end, one of the first major features you'll come to on the Hwy 20 is the Gorge Dam. you can see the dam and bridge from the highway, but take a few minutes to park and take a cute little walk up the falls and read about the construction of the dam inside the dam building itself. Apparently the trail was built as proof of the wonders technology (power) could bring to the woods. There are spotlights and sprinklers dotting the trail, almost invisible to the hiker. Supposedly they still light up at night to showcase the plants and trees that line the short walk up the falls. The walk is short, but the view of the creek is very pretty. Definitely recommend this quick stop for a break to stretch your leg and as a walk that young children or less mobile adults can handle."

The trailhead is next to the Gorge Powerhouse and is reached by crossing the Skagit River via a suspension footbridge to a small garden where Ladder Creek flows into the Skagit. From here, follow the signs for the trail that climbs through a gardened landscape, up along Ladder Creek, to the small overlook for the falls."

It is gorgeous and peaceful. We went on Labor Day so my husband was very disappointed that the Gorge Powerhouse visitor center wasn't also open which means we'll just have to visit again!

We really did not expect much so were pleasantly surprised at the nice walk, pretty views, cool information center, and clean bathrooms. We went during a rainstorm so the waterfalls and streams were particularly beautiful but I think it would be nice any time of year. I enjoyed seeing how the how the dam works and looking at old photos of it being built. Neat experience. I'd recommend stopping if you have an extra 20-45 minutes on your way through. Next time, we'll stop with the kids and at night so we can see it lit up."

During an unfortunate visit to the area for his funeral services, we found a little light at the end of the tunnel.  The North Cascade Forest is so serene and beautiful.  We went to check out the falls during the day, but the next night, I had to be nosey to see if the falls were actually lit, and they were.  This little gem in the mountains is well worth the short walk across the bridge.  The colors at night are spectacular.  Go up at around dusk to check out the day and night views.  Catch up on the history of the falls before entering the area.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  I can't pick a favorite color of the falls as they all were breathtaking!"

Beautiful lodge-style center.  The educational display area has much to offer about the park's fauna and flora.  Big topographical display of the park.  Rangers are friendly and helpful.  Nice little gift shop.  Wonderful boardwalk to view of snow-capped mountains is short and easy for any age or mobility.  Also, use this opportunity to get out of the car and stretch your legs on a very enjoyable 2-mile hike right out the back door of the visitor center down to the river (note that this hike involves some steep inclines and is not for those without good mobility).  Center offers a free 25-minute movie, but can't really recommend it.  It's rather abstract and not the historical overview you'd expect, given the diverse audiences.  We did, however, have fun mimicking the movie's creepy whispering throughout the rest of our trip."

You pull in, find an empty site that you like, set up and then go pay for your spot. It also happens that there are sites on both sides of the main highway. We chose a spot on the opposite of the ""main"" area to pull into and instantly knew we had made the right decision.  We found a spot right next to the river that runs through the campground.  We could hear the river from our RV...it was awesome! If you don't enjoy that sound, there are plenty of sites that are not next to the river. "
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Colonial Creek Campground - Stehekin Valley Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Can't wait to go back!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was the first time we tried a ""no reservation"" campground and are kicking ourselves we didn't do it earlier.  With all sorts of kids stuff going on we don't tend to plan camping weekends out too far in advance and due to only going to State park or KOA types in the past that often meant we didn't get to go when we all of a sudden had a free weekend due to lack of availability.  This past weekend (Labor Day w/e) we suddenly had an opening and decided to try Colonial Creek on Diablo Lake.  We were worried about driving up there and not getting a spot but it was no problem at all!  We arrived around noon on Friday and had our pick of spots but there were spots open through Saturday mid day.  At $12 a night we got 2 sites so we could spread out (2 tents).  We brought kayaks and a paddle board and loved being able to just leave them on the beach overnight and put in when ever we wanted to.  The lake was basically empty, a few motor boats and other kayaks/canoes but often you felt like you had the whole lake to yourself.  Next time we want to try one of the 3 boat access only spots!"

Off hwy 20.  No reservation, arrive early, recommend 09-10 during high season, as most campers leave park around 08-10 am.  Even that, many riverfront camping spots will be taken by long term campers.  There are ""designated & reserved"" spaces for handicapped.  There are walk-in tent sites along riverfront close to the park entrance, but less privacy.  Sites toward the far end of the entrance are fairly private and quiet.  Flushed toilets (with electrical 1 electrical outlet) are conveniently located.  Activities: walking, hiking, swimming, fishing or just relaxing.  Loved the birds singing in the early morning.

North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),North Cascades National Park,Mountains,4.5,Park is a disgrace,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The location to pick up backcountry permits is on a one lane road and traffic conditions are terrible!  The road is too narrow for the amount of traffic, there are little kids running around playing as it seems to be a quiet dead-end rural home area, and the speed limit is 25 then drops to 15 so it takes forever to get there.  The staff may be nice and helpful, but they are rude and disrespectful to their neighbors who are upset with them.  I saw one man get threatened with a ticket when he told someone going 50 in the 15 to slow down because his grandson was playing there and he is 2.  I mean, what kind of park is this?  Oh that's right, it's actually NOT a park!  it is a Forest Maintenance Center and they moved the permit place up from Sedro Woolley and don't use their Newhalem or Darrington locations.  So now you have tons of people in a small little space with pissed off neighbors, rude park rangers, and little kids who could get hit and killed by cars speeding because what do visitors care.  Would love to see what dipstick came up with this plan."

North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Maple Pass Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing hike.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing hike. We did the loop counterclockwise and it was definitely the correct way to go. Would be a challenging hike for someone who is not in good shape. There were wildfires nearby so there was a fair amount of smoke but the views were still amazing. There were a decent amount of wildflowers in the lower portions of the trail. We started about 8:00 on a hot day and it was a good decision as over half the trail is above the tree line. We hiked on a Thursday and the parking lot was less than half full when we arrived but about 80% full by time we left at noon.
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Maple Pass Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Spectacular Hike in North Cascades Mountains,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were looking for a great day hike in or near the North Cascades National park in Washington state and found Maple Loop Trail on Tripadvisor and several other online travel forums. The 7.1 miles round trip did not sound challenging but we had to think twice about the elevation - up and down 2000 feet in those 7 miles. We checked with the lodge receptionist who encouraged us to go saying she has done the trail not too long ago and she was retirement age. The hike started from Rainy Lake area parking lot and we decided to go anti-clockwise (following the signs) so that we would go up more gradually and handle the steeper part on the way back. The incline was not bad and we soon started admiring wonderful views of the surrounding mountains. After going a bit further, we saw wonderful views of Lake Ann that we kept seeing repeatedly throughout the hike. After passing the Heather Meadows, a wonderful view of surrounding mountain ranges opened up and we could see a lot of colored bushes and trees and chipmunks running around. We hiked further up to Maple Pass (elevation 7000 ft) and were able to admire Frisco Mountain up close. Another view to a valley a bit further away opened up before the trail turned back and we started descending to the valley. Huckleberries along the way and beautiful glimpses of Rainy Lake made the descent fun despite the more challenging terrain. We were really excited about all the wonderful views that we could admire on this hike. Even thought it might be challenging for couch potatoes, everyone can do it if they take their time and it is one of the most beautiful mountain hikes in Washington."

I did Maple pass on day 1...I started early to beat all the foot traffic (go to the parking lot at the crack of dawn..it gets quite busy late morning). there were a couple more people. I did the clockwise loop (in hindsight I should have done anti-clockwise) will come to that later.

North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Maple Pass Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Beauty of a hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes it is indeed gorgeous.  The views looking down at Lake Ann should make you stop more than once as you make your way up the mountain.  Frankly the hike to Lake Ann was meh to me.  Muddy and I'm short so I couldn't see the lake from the ground.  Too much water under the driftwood and way too many black flies to want to hang around anyway.  The colors of the lake don't come into full color until you are above it with the sun shining anyway.  But we did hike to the lake first and then started the long climb up to Maple Pass.  I had not read any reviews prior to hiking but we always carry layers and I even had my wool hat/gloves/winter coat.  A lot of the trail I was very hot and sweating when I was exposed to full on sun.  Hiking on big rocks that retain the heat doesn't help!  When we got about 30 minutes from the top we met a forestry worker who engaged us in conversation.  In learning it was our first time hiking she advised we only go up to the ""border sign"" as the views are essentially the same as all the way up top.  Conditions were still snowy to that point and even worse beyond.  When we climbed up through the snow we realized going any further made zero sense as we did not have clamp ons for our boots, so we did as she suggested and came back down the same way.  Beautiful up there but the black flies were still biting so we were unable to sit and eat our lunch.  From that point our round trip was 5.5 hours."

North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Maple Pass Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,One amazing view after another - a MUST HIKE!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"You can hike this loop either clockwise or counterclockwise.  If you choose to go clockwise, you'll have the majority of elevation change in one large chunk at the beginning of your hike, but I would highly recommend going counterclockwise (which I think is the way the trail is marked) - if you hike this way, you'll have a nice view...followed by a nicer view...followed by an epic view...followed my a more epic view, etc etc (I think the views slowly motivate you as it's a challenging hike for those who are a bit of couch potatoes!).  This is one of the most beautiful hikes I'd ever done - absolutely love it and cannot wait to share pictures with friends and family.  Take your time on the way down as it can be hard on your joints (and be sure to wear good footwear to avoid blisters)."
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Maple Pass Loop,Hiking Trails,5.0,Stunning views!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did this hike mid-July and made it to Heather Pass, but couldn't continue due to snow.  It didn't matter though because the hike to that point was incredible. We went counter-clockwise, which is a more gradual elevation gain. You start out going through beautiful old growth forests, pass a pristine alpine lake (Lake Ann), and continue with amazing views of mountain peaks all around you. I can't speak to the 2nd half of the loop, but the first half was well worth it and probably the best day hike I have ever been on (and I have been on many!). I would recommend going in early August or later if you want to be sure the full loop is passable. We saw beautiful wildflowers on the trail also."

Leg-stretcher time and a quick snapshot.  But, this Overlook at Washington Pass was delightful!  You could walk around on a trail-a couple different options-and take in the scenery all around you.  You absorb the atmosphere of the mountains and feel their magic, right there off the highway.  There is a spot where the trail goes over a rocky area and makes you feel like you are actually on an adventure more than just a quick stop to take a snapshot.  A very well-done overlook---thank you, State of Washington."
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Washington Pass Overlook,Mountains,5.0,Hold your jaw up so it doesn't drag on the rocks,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"For anyone traveling the North Cascades Loop, the most jaw-dropping views are at the Washington Pass Overlook. It appears that there used to be a very nice facility but it is now closed and only an ordinary toilet replaced it. There wasn;t a sign so we had to find our way, but the trail leads away from the parking lot in the opposite direction from the closed building. For those of us who get a bit squeamish with hights, be assured that the views are just as spectacular several steps back from the railing. The main viewpoint is a barren rock jutting out from the mountainside with just a straight drop down. Be sure to follow the trail around for views in other directions, also."

The first 2 miles or so is a switchback climb through the woods but once you level out, the views are breathtaking.  We intended to stop at the end of the Cascade Pass Trail but another hiker who was there advised us to go at least a mile up the Sahale Arm Trail.  It was another strenuous climb but absolutely worth it!  Between the mountains, meadows, flowers, dear, glaciers, and lake, we were in awe.  Its a good hour drive on the gravel/dirt road to get to the trailhead but don't let that stop you. "
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Cascade Pass,Hiking Trails,4.5,If I Had Only Gone A Day Earlier,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one awesome hike. This was my most anticipated activity on our trip. If I had gone the day before, I would have had more sunshine and it would have been even more spectacular. Even without a lot of sun, the trek is still worth while. Make sure you have good hiking boots. Mine died a few days before and the trek up with tennis shoes made it more challenging. The views from the parking lot are worth the drive up even if you don't hike up. Restrooms and a picnic area are available for day use visitors. You can actually see the area of the pass from the lot as well. The trail is a 7.4 mile (round trip), 1700 foot elevation gain trail. The first couple of miles or so are switchbacks through the trees. Most are easy to moderate and there about 30 something to go up. After the trees, the trail levels out before one final push to the pass. With the weather we had this year, I did encounter some some snow in mid August, but that is not the norm. There is a patio type area at the pass where you can have your lunch and enjoy more views of the mountains. If you are more adventurous, the trails continue into the mountains, but with my shoes, I stopped. One can walk to Stehekin if they choose, but thats a long walk.  Keep an eye out for wildlife too. A couple of marmots made an appearance on the way down. Overall, this area is worth the 23 mile drive (13 unpaved) from Marblemount. The North Cascades at it's very best."
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Cascade Pass,Hiking Trails,4.5,A very nice day hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I guess quite a few people are confusing ""Cascade Pass trail"" with the park itself.  Cascade pass trailhead is located at the end of Cascade River Road at Marblemount, off Hwy 20 at milepost 106, next to a Shell and a Chevron gas stations.  It's a 23mi drive to the trailhead, however, be aware that there's 12mi of gravel road and it takes about 1hr to drive in or out.  Passenger cars are fine though.  The trail is 7.4mi round trip with 1700ft elevation gain, but with easy switchbacks in the woods, so it's mostly shaded and not a difficult climb.  Rangers say the trail is good for kids and that's quite true.  The mountain views are stunning--some say it's better than the Alps :-)  Not sure if I would agree, but the hike was totally worthwhile.  Don't worry if it's fogged up in the morning--once you're above the tree line, you'll see peaks surrounded by fog and clouds, making you think about paradise.  Such a surreal experience!"

They are very steep, sometimes one lane, slippery, windy and narrow, along with numerous potholes. Make sure you have a good car to get up this mountain. You won't regret it after you get up. There is a gorgeous waterfall just past a bridge right before the upper parking lot.  If you don't want to hike it, the view is spectacular right from the parking lot. "

North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Cascade Pass,Hiking Trails,4.5,Give this hike a pass,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"With all the great reviews of this hike as the best in North Cascades National Park we decided to give it a try. We drove from Winthrop over Washington Pass and to the west end of the park and found the Cascade River Road to the trail head. The first ten miles are paved and two lanes. So far so good. Then the road turns into an axle busting rutted dirt and gravel road for another seven miles to the Park gate. Then the real fun begins. The rest of the road is as bad as the previous seven miles but it narrows to barely a one car width. So if you meet another car in the next seven miles you either have to back up or down this torturous road to one of the few spaces where two cars can squeeze by. When we finally got to the end the parking was filled so we had to wait for someone to leave so we could do the hike. Lastly, Cascade Pass is on the cloudy and foggy west side of the Park, so while east of Washington Pass it may be sunny, here it will most likely be foggy.The hike had way too many switchbacks and bugs for the payoff. When we finally got down the road we all agreed it was not worth the effort. We've driven on some of the most hair-raising roads in the West but this one really stressed us out. There are literally hundreds of fabulous hikes in the National Parks (we've taken many of them) that have trail heads at accessible places. For this hike we didn't think the stress on the car, the driver, and the passengers was worth it."
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Cascade Pass,Hiking Trails,4.5,Awesome hike,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well worth the long drive into the deep forest. The road is mostly paved until the last 8 miles are gravel turning into a narrow winding road, took an hour to drive it. We did it in a small sedan car but an SUV would have been more comfortable. The Hike has tons of switchbacks, probably 30 or more, and lots of flies. Use 100% Deet to deter the flies, some people wore nets. They didn't bite a lot but terribly annoying. Once done with the switchbacks, the forest opens up to a jaw-dropping view. You'll cross 2 small snow fields, easy with good boots & trekking poles. The pass has lots of large boulders in a circle and some of the best mountain views you'll ever see. Great spot for lunch. There's an "" out-house"" for use and other trails to explore from the pass. Ran into a black bear on the way down so carry some bear spray, it ran away more scared than Us! Super day Hike, took about 4-5 hours with a lunch. Best hike in the Cascades!"

North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Ross Lake National Recreation Area,National Parks,4.5,a few thoughts on ross lake trip,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Just back form a wonderful week on Ross Lake.  What would I have liked to know before we left for our trip?  1. Canoeing gear rented from Ross Lake Resort is of high quality and appropriate for the conditions. Though they do not rent dry suits.  Traveling with young-ish children, I do recommend them.  The suits also made for much more pleasant and longer-lasting swimming sessions.  2. I estimate that for every hour you canoe up-lake, it will take you three hours to canoe down-lake (back to Ross Lake Resort and the dam). We had fair and pleasant weather, but still, even the moderate breeze was enough resistance to give one a good workout.  3. The poop shacks (aka outhouses) are right next to the camping spots. Be prepared for a pungent odor unless you are lucky enough to land a spot at a distance, or upwind.  Also, just because you reserved a ""group site"" be prepared for not enough sites to set up your tent. We spent a night at a ""group site"" that had two tent pads.  We were a gorup of seven with a total of four tents."

I felt a little intimidated at first by how complicated it is to get there, but it was really not bad.  There's a designated Ross Lake parking area at the Diablo Lake ferry dock.  You have to carry all your stuff down the steps to the ferry dock, but it's pretty easy after that.  The twice-daily ferry takes you to the other side of Diablo Lake, where you're met by the friendly people from Ross Lake Resort.  They drive you and your bags in the back of a flat-bed truck overland to Ross Lake.  There, you're met by another boat, which takes you directly to your cabin at Ross Lake Resort."

Ross Lake NRA includes Gorge Lake, Diablo Lake, and Ross Lake.  I enjoyed a couple small hikes and took in some overlooks during my visit, but the NRA also offers plenty of paddling, fishing, camping, and better hiking opportunities."
North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),Ross Lake National Recreation Area,National Parks,4.5,Where Most North Cascades Visitors Actually Visit,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Driving the scenic North Cascades Highway (WA-20) through the North Cascades National Park complex is by far the most popular way to visit; however, the highway actually passes through the Ross Lake National Recreation Area which bisects the national park into two sections north and south of the recreational area.  The reason for this is that the area was already developed by Seattle City Light with three dams, and the reservoirs they impound, and the still operating company town of Nehalem; this development conflicts with the mission of a national park to preserve and even return an area to its natural state.  Clearly this was not an option for a complex that provides Seattle a good portion of its electrical power and for this reason, this sliver of a recreational area, with a large area encompassing Ross Lake extending north, was established through the center North Cascades National Park when it was established."

The trail is about 4.5 miles RT and ends at a beautiful blue lake surrounded by mountains. There is a bit of climbing involved but it’s completely worth it! You can hike right down to the lake and there was a mountain goat on one of the lower ridges overlooking the lake. Once you’re at the lake, there’s a side trail called Tarn Loop that looked like it would take you possibly closer to the area where the goat was but we didn’t hike it.

But this hike was very pretty from the very start.  Right at the trailhead, being in late September, colors were beginning to show on the ground (like the tundra in Alaska).  That gave me hope as the prior day I had been somewhat dismayed walking through a lot of dark green forest with not much else.  Although the day was still rainy off and on, it was a beautiful hike---the forest itself was very pretty, with various types of shrubbery bordering the trail,rocks of various sizes and shapes and occasional views of the mountains along the way.  At a few spots along the way, you come round a corner and boom---there is a rainbow of colors!   And all this was even before getting to the lake :)"

Mid 60s with some moderate rain on the hike back. Hiking up, it feels like you're going the wrong way and its tempting to turn back. But its definitely worth it. The trail is beautiful with great views of the snow capped mountains. The only thing I regret is not bringing anything to protect against bears. An airhorn, pepper spray, or even a gun is a must. You could hike the four miles without running into to anyone, so protect yourself. Once I got to the lake, I brought a change of clothes so I decided to jump in. Coldest water I've ever been in, but it was worth it. The water was crisp and blue, I definitely recommend taking the plunge if you're up to it. "

We enjoyed cheese and crackers while soaking in the view. Magnificent. An A+ hike cause its vigorous but with an outstanding payoff. My feet were sore on the way down so I walked part of it in my stocking feet. I saw a 10 year old boy doing this and asked his name.

North Cascades National Park,Washington (WA),North Cascades Highway,Scenic Drives,4.5,Amazing Beauty,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We visited North Cascades National Park as a day trip from Seattle.  It was about a 3 hour drive to the park from our location in the south of Seattle.  Part of the trip was on major interstate and part was on Route 20 otherwise known as the North Cascades Scenic Highway.  A couple tips for this part of the trip:  gas stations are few to nonexistent as you get closer to the park so be sure to have enough gas in your tank before you enter the park area.  Also. if gas is hard to find.....food is harder to find.  There is absolutely no where in the park to buy food and no where within miles of the park to find it either.  Luckily we had a bag of Doritos and a bottle of water with us!

Parking is in a small lot but we didn't have any issues getting a spot on Tuesday 8/3 at around 2:30 pm.  This trail is 2.2 miles (roundtrip) with 446 feet elevation gain and the elevation was up and down which made it more difficult.  There were quite a bit of mosquitoes on the day we visited.

Unfortunately we underestimated the difficulty of this hike--there are really many steep ups and downs on the way and we did not feel it was suitable for kids unless they are part of experienced hiker family (which our kids are not).  My 6 year old son turned around after the first lake and, although my 10-year old daughter and I did get to the end, she did get upset several times and lost hope.  There was still snow in many places and we had to also walk on it for a few hundred feet (which we also did not expect).  While the views along the way were indeed beautiful, I was really underwhelmed by what I saw at the end, because I could not even find a place to get  to the lake easily and touch the water.  There was a sign pointing to campsite and restrooms, but we found neither when followed that arrow.  So, I would certainly NOT  recommend it for basic casual hikers, like ourselves, because what you see, especially at the ends, is just not worth the aggravation and time and nerves you will lose during the walk."

Rainier,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"If you're in the mood for the outdoors, fantastic views and not a lot of people at Mt. Rainier National Park, the Bench and Snow Lakes Trail is a definite must see.  The trail leads to two beautiful lakes.  After hiking up, down and up again through The Bench (area between two ridges with fantastic views), at 0.7 miles reach the side spur to Bench Lake.  The view of the lake with Mt. Rainier peaking in the background is best viewed from the top of the trail.  After a bit more hiking (another 0.5 mi) reach Snow Lake, a true glacial lake.  Even with all of our hot weather, there was still a bit of snow in the rock fields behind the lake.  Save lots of time for exploring because every few feet you discover something new.  And on the way back, you're treated to some of the most amazing views of Mt. Rainier without the crowds of Paradise or other popular sites in the park."

About 2/3 of the way around, you will come up at Faraway Rock, which gives a spectacular view of Reflection Lake and Louise Lake.

Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Reflection Lakes,Bodies of Water,5.0,A fantastic photography location,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"During our recent two days trip to the Mount Rainier National Park, I made an earlier enquiry from my guide, places that would make great photography locations and one of the location is the Reflection Lake. I googled it and was immediately taken aback with the beauty of this place and the various composition of this amazing place at different time of the day. I wanted to hopefully captured some shots during sunset and my perspective of this amazing place. On the day, I arrived at the Packwood Hotel where I stayed for the night, I asked the hotel the distance and time needed to get there. I was told that it would take at least 40 minutes. The sun is forecasted to set around 9pm. After a short rest, I took off at 7:30pm and got there by 8:20pm. With GPS, the place was easy to find. It was still very bright and as I got down to the lake, I was a little disappointed as the water was choppy with the wind blowing, blowing any chances of a reflection. But the sight is still amazing nevertheless. As I set up the camera and started to compose my shots from different angle and position, the wind died down and slowly but surely, the water in the lake started to calm down and the reflection of Mount Rainier started to emerge from the depths of the lake as it were. I was also lucky that there was little clouds that evening and hence, Mount Rainier was clear and unblocked. As the skies darkened, the wind died down completely and what a reflection it was on the water. Words cannot begin to describe the serenity and the beauty of this sight. By the time I packed up my gear and headed back to the hotel, the sun has set. It was a long drive back in the dark but it was worth the trip. A strongly recommended location for a good picture."

Rainier & the Olympic Penninsula,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an absolutely breathtaking hike in the first week of August. There were abundant wildflowers, magical misty lakes, looming mountains, and snow. The recommendation to take the loop clockwise was a good one for us, as most of the wildflowers and beautiful scenery were in the first half of the trail for us. We would have gotten a nice view walking towards Mt. Rainier on the second half, but it was obstructed by the weather (per usual in our 3 trips to Mt. Rainier). There weren't as many wildflowers or points of interest on the second half of the trail without that mountain view (although still pretty and misty & magical looking), so we could have gone back the way we came and been just as happy.  This was our one hike at Mt. Rainier this time (because the weather was miserable in Paradise and there were no parking spots at the visitor's center) and it was a good trail--it had a little of everything. It was also sparsely visited, which was a bonus. I would allow at least 3 hours if you really want to enjoy it and maybe have lunch on the little rock on the 2nd lake. Not too strenuous, but not flat either. Our 3 teens loved it--no complaining. I'd recommend having a map, but FYI there is a little lake (Tipsoo lake?) at the start of the trail, then hike clockwise a ways uphill and you'll get to another lake with a tiny little peninsula with a little rock you can walk out to, then walk a ways longer uphill and in the distance you'll see what looks like 2 lakes (Dewey Lake). Soon you'll see a trail marker for Pacific Trail/Tipsoo Lake/Dewey Lake, and you'll keep right and head back west and north to the start of the trail."

The trail offers good views and photographic opportunities of Mount Rainier at sunrise and dusk if weather conditions are friendly.  In addition, the drive between the intersection of highways 410 and 123 to the parking lot for the trailhead offers some excellent views as it winds up and down.

Rainier is in front of you but we simply stopped and turned around any time we wanted to see it. Not a problem. By being the only ones going in this direction we had the first half of the hike to ourselves which was fantastic. The tranquility of the wildflower filled meadows, the snow capped mountain vistas, the perfect rock outcropping for lunch overlooking Dewey Lake, it was all magical and peaceful. On the other side we met a lot of hikers struggling up the snow covered sections while we were coasting down them. Beautiful from end to end, but don't listen to the ""experts.""

It is so different than the Rockies, or the mountains of Vermont, Heavenly Valley in Lake Tahoe, or any of the other mountains I have enjoyed, close in greatness to Mt.Shasta in California, but more beautiful and easily seen from almost anywhere within miles of its tremendous peaks. The drive up even on a snowy day is worth the trip. Seeing it from a distance is unbelievable, but actually heading up is exciting, thrilling and hard to keep your eyes on the road for want of taking it all in but once you've made your way up it becomes breathtaking, not for lack of oxygen, but for the views. If you are ever lucky enough to visit the beautiful state of Washington you must make it a point to take the drive up the mountain. As I stated, seeing it from almost any distance is a rare pleasure, but actually seeing the views from above the clouds is a site that you, your children, grandchildren, or any one else that you share the experience with will never forget it, and thank you forever."

Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Mt. Fremont Lookout Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Beautiful & amazing scenery of tall trees & mountain cover with snow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,WE drove from Seatac Seattle to the national park . WE enjoyed the driving all the way to the gate. The park ranger @ the entrance gate was so niced & told us the visitor center is closed buy we can drive all the way to the center. WE are so grateful that they cleared the snow road & can drive without tire chain. WE are blown away of the scenic beauty of the tall pine trees & mountain covered w/ snow. You can get a full view of the mountain when you reach the top 5000 ft plus.
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Mt. Fremont Lookout Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,I Love Mt. Rainier National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"One of my favorite places to visit is National Parks.  We went up there from Spanaway, WA on a Monday.  The road is very winding and narrow, so plan on giving yourself plenty of time to be safe.  Along the way, there are several pulloffs where there is something of nature exciting to see, such as a waterfall coming down the mountain and under a bridge.  Additionally, we stopped at what I will call Rainbow Falls.  I am a senior citizen and have had recent foot surgery, but I did not come all the way from Texas not to walk down to the ""seeing"" point.  I kept my hand on my son's back going down because I feared slipping on the loose gravel, but I needed no help going back up. The falls come down the mountain and with the sun shining, there was a rainbow in it.  Very Nice.  After this, we drove on up to the National Park Lodge.  Very typical of a National Park Lodge like at Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, (but not as big as the one at Old Faithful).  But it was very nice, great ambience and good gift shop.  My son in law and his kids took a hike up the mountain there.  They saw fields of flowers and the girls loved it and wanted to go further.  We were on a limited time frame, but all 9 of us liked it and I would really like to revisit again and take that hike to see the flowers.  This is really nature at its finest--like Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, etc.--just great to see the natural wonders of this world."

All others should not miss this impressive stand of mammoth Douglas fir, cedar, and hemlock.  The trail to the grove is one of the easiest in Mt. Rainier National Park, and most people should have no difficulty in making it.  The largest of the trees is across a hanging bridge.  Don't miss the ""twin giants"" (two incredible old Douglas fir trees growing side by side).  Interesting to observe the trees in various stages of life, from the massive mature trees, to the fallen giants that provide a rich ""nurse bed"" for new seedlings growing in rows along the rotting fallen tree trunks, or in groups on rotting stumps.  If I could make only on hike in Mt. Rainier National Park, this is probably the one I'd choose."

I got out to hike the easy 3 mile walk. Dave tried to join me for a short while but soon returned to the parking area where he rested his back and knees staying in the shade at a picnic table. The east walk (little ups and downs but a bit rocky at first) was quiet and peaceful. I had the trail mostly to myself. The tall Douglas Firs provided cooling shade and created a cathedral-like atmosphere on the winding path along the river. I crossed a suspension bridge over the clean, clear turquoise Ohanapecosh River rushing over colored stones. The same stones out of the water were not colorful but simply gray. The path continued on the other side of the river for a few hundred feet before turning to sand and then boardwalk entering the short Grove of the Patriarchs Loop. The tall cedar and fir gave a serenity to the grove and luckily I was able to experience it all alone. It took me over an hour, stopping along the way to reflect and photograph, before returning to find Dave had banged his head on the car again. This man needs a full time nurse!"

At the last minute we decided to go up to see the Sunrise Visitor Center, i'm so glad we did!   The drive up to Sunrise is easy, the roads are fine. We stopped at a few amazing viewpoints then headed up to the top, 6100 feet. There was still some snow left over from plowing the lots, after oogling the mountain we threw a few snowballs at each other then went in for dinner at the cafe/gift shop.  Had some tasty burgers at this clean well run place then headed back down the mountain to find a camp spot . The prices are a tad bit higher in the cafe because of the remote location but there is a full menu of favorite cafe items. Lovely evening, As mentioned earlier, the pictures cannot do justice to the beauty of this area!"

We drove up to Sunrise and enjoyed the inspiring scenery.  If you can't hike, it's worth the drive anyway.  You can enjoy tremendous viewpoints accessible by car.    If you can hike, do it.   We chose the Burroughs trail due to limited time.  We went at a leisurely pace and took several stops along the way to soak in the beauty.  Glacier View Point was amazing.  We stayed there for about 40 minutes and had it all to ourselves. We took that time to enjoy the beauty and praise God for His majesty and creativity.    Our only regret is that we did not spend more time at Mt. Rainier during our vacation."
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Sunrise Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Breathtaking Views and Lots of Snow,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the highest point on Mount Rainier that you can drive to in a car. You don't even have to leave the parking lot to get magnificent views. There are plenty of easy, short trails for families with young children or for those who don't want a long hike. If you plan on taking the longer trails (like Burrough's Mountain), be warned. There is much snow in summer and 2011 was an exceptional year for late snow. Talk with rangers before heading out on backcountry trails as there will be steep snow fields requiring ice axes in some areas. Only the experienced hiker should go. Inexperienced and unprepared hikers should stay on the lower trails. Also, do stay on the marked trails to avoid trampling the delicate alpine meadows."
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Sunrise Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,An Early Morning Wildfile Bonanza at Sunrise,5.0 of 5 bubbles,I visited Paradise on Saturday and Sunrise the next day.  I got to Sunrise Point about 3 miles prior to the Visitor Center about 20 minutes before the sunrise.  Sunrise Point is a good location to obtain a good view of the mountain as the first light strikes the mountain and walks it's way down since the sun is directly behind you as you face the mountain here.  To obtain the best sunrise shots you will need a tripod.  I arrived 20 - 30 minutes before sunrise to set up and get ready.  It was a bit disappointing that a large number of people arrived just prior to sunrise and moved into the area of my shots.  I jumped in the car and drove a little closer to the Sunrise visitor center and simply pulled off on one of the pull-offs and got great shots of the actual sunrise.
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Sunrise Visitor Center,Visitor Centers,4.5,Outstanding Views and Day Hikes,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We visited Sunrise in Mt. Rainier National Park on a beautiful, clear Friday in July and found the experience to be fantastic.  I would highly recommend this trip to anyone seeking outstanding scenery, a memorable picnic, and/or a day hike.  There is a winding road that takes you to Sunrise, and while not all that harrowing, if you are afraid of heights you should probably not look down at some points during the drive.  Sunrise Point will be the first parking lot you come to – it has beautiful views (we were lucky enough to see Mt. Adams clearly from there) and some signs identifying the mountains.  From there it is a short drive to Sunrise, which is where you can talk to rangers in the visitor center to help plan your day; they were very happy to help us select our hiking plan and provided us with tips and a map.  You can also look through a telescope there and see people climbing the mountain!"

It is a two hour drive from Seattle and the last 15 miles from the Park entrance on the northeastern flank of the mountain is a memorable mountain road.

Paradise,Washington (WA),Paradise Valley,Mountains,5.0,Magnificent even without the fields of blooming wildflowers,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the jumping off (figuratively-speaking) spot for first-time visitors to Mount Rainier National Park and as well as the tour group day-trippers from nearby Seattle. In other words this place can get packed, especially during the high-season of summer wildflower blooming (July-August).  Overheard while waiting in line to dine at the Paradise Inn restaurant: in July the traffic from the Nisqually entry to Paradise was bumper-to-bumper. We were here on the off-season and the road was an easy drive but the main parking lot by the inn and visitors’ center was full before noon and we had to drive back down a bit to the lower parking lot. Not a major inconvenience by any means but it is easy to imagine how crazy it must get in the summer.  So here are some suggestions after which I will describe our time at Paradise in more detail."
Paradise,Washington (WA),Paradise Valley,Mountains,5.0,Paradise Valley should be on your bucket list,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is by far the most popular area of Mount Rainier and surprisingly has no reviews. Paradise is located at the 5420' level of Mount Rainier and is one of the snowiest  places on Earth. Every year they get an average of 700 inches of Snow. This past winter they had much more  and when we visied  last month there was still 12 feet (not 11) of snow on the ground. This was our third visit to Paradise and the second on a sunny day which is a prerequsite for a beautiful view of Mt Rainier. Anyone visiting Mt Rainier on a sunny day may look around and above and actually believe they are in Paradise.

The drive from the entrance up to the valley was really beautiful and helped cleared my mind. It was relaxing and scenic. Really worth driving all the way from Seattle to here. We also visited the easy trail from the visitor centre (nisqually vista trail) and it was really nice 
Paradise,Washington (WA),Paradise Valley,Mountains,5.0,Just breathtaking,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A trip to Paradise will change you, especially if you are lucky to get a clear day and full view of the mountain. Hiking up to Pebble Creek is not an easy climb, but well worth it. I found the top of the high skyline ridge better for panoramic views than the panorama view point. If you have the time you can take both in as part of the skyline trail. Recommend walking the entire loop in a clockwise direction. Views of the mountain make it easier to forget the climb. Deer, pika and marmot were in abundance today. The only downside to today is I now want to give up my desk job and live in the mountains. This place is amazing. The pics show you MT Rainier in perfect splendour. "

We woke up early on our second day at the park after spending the night at Paradise Inn and hiked this trail.  The weather was great and we could see the peak the entire time.  By the end of the trail, the sun had come out and the meadows were magical.  Whether looking out at 3 other volcanic Cascades, Adams, Hood (in Oregon) and St. Helen's, from Panorama Point or viewing the glaciers and peak from below, this hike is amazing.  "
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Skyline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Lots of snow on this trail so crampons are helpful!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is one of our favorite hikes on Mt. Rainier except this year there was 85% snow on the trail when we hiked on July 22.   The ranger told us that Mt. Rainier had 130 inches more snow than last year so lots of snow on this trail.  We had hiking boots, trekking poles  and our micro spikes. Several tourists were in sneakers and slipping and sliding along the way.  I'm sure their feet got  wet from the slushy snow. Please consult Mt. Rainier's website to check on snow levels so you can be prepare to hike on this trail.  It isn't an easy hike. The clouds were covering Mt. Rainier in the morning but cleared up by the time we reach McCure rock. You could see Mt. Adams also.   Stunning  views of the mountain and waterfall.  We like to start at the end of the trail (near Paradise Lodge) by going down the trail instead of going up.  There is less people this direction.  When we were coming down from Panoramic Point there was a bottleneck along one  narrow section of the trail as many tourists are coming up this way."
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Skyline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing trail!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We started at the visitors center but it doesn’t show here because we accidentally ended the hike on the app.  Tips first: Get there early.  We arrived at 7:30 and the parking lot was packed.  It was a Sunday and the weather was perfect.  That could’ve had something to do with it.  Starting early will also keep you more in the shade and cooler.  Go clockwise.  Use your sunscreen!  The sun can be brutal.  Walking poles are a plus too.  Bugs weren’t bad at all.  Slow and steady is the way to go.  It’s a tough incline at the start and the finish.  It took us 4 hrs 9 min and we did lots of stops just to soak in the beauty.  Plenty of snow can be seen still but very little on the trail.  The snow that is on the trail is super slushy and slippery.  We slid down with garbage bags which was a hoot!  Trail is well marked.  There’s plenty of wildlife and we saw a sooty grouse, lots of marmots and chipmunks too.  There was a lot of wildflowers too."
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Skyline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Among the best of the best,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We have hiked many NP trails and this one gets into the top three trails of all time (so far!). If you are only going to do one thing at Mt. Rainier, this is it. It IS strenuous but little kids and adults in their 70s were doing it—just at a slower pace. It is so beautiful you will forget all about the effort to get to the top once you are there."
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Skyline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Highlights of Rainier in 4 hours,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I visited on a clear Sunday at about 7:30am. The main lot was almost full and the overflow was about half full. The hike is not terribly challenging. It gets labeled as strenuous, but that's probably due to its popularity and wanting to instill some kind of caution in the crowds. Clockwise is the way to go on this one. If you go on a clear day, you will have view of Rainier for almost the entire hike. You will also spot glacial falls, wildflowers, marmots, chipmunks, Myrtle Falls, Mt Adams and St Helens in the distance, and probably snow in spots. It's a great overview hike that gets the best of Rainier, but the crowds would likely steer me away on subsequent trips. Most high elevation hikes will get you views of Rainier if the weather cooperates. On the way back, there were several parking spots open around 11:30am. It seems like 8-10 or 11 is probably the worst time to arrive, but otherwise I think you are fine. Definitely one to do for the highlights of the park, but you may want to venture off the beaten path on future visits."

Rainier. This trail is very crowded be early (before 8 am) to get a parking spot. We made a short side trail ( out and back 2 mile extra) to Paradise Glacier Trail; that is fun as where the maintained path ends, the glacier starts and you can walk (safely) on it."
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Skyline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Experience winter in June,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Skyline Trail would not be an especially challenging trail but for the fact that it is covered in snow, even in late June.  And since the trail traverses steep hills and cliffs, a slip or a misstep can be a big problem.  Hiking boots were barely sufficient and I wished I had poles or spiked shoes.  The trail itself provides magnificent views of Mt. Rainier and the surrounding mountain ranges, picturesque Myrtle Falls, and wildlife viewing (I saw mountain goats and marmots).  This is Mt. Rainier's most popular trail for a reason, and it's highly advisable to get there to start before 10 am when the crowds arrive."
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Skyline Trail,Hiking Trails,5.0,Amazing views but hard work,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"We were here in June and a lot of this trail was still covered in snow.

We took a tour with a group of 15 people and our guide was pretty amazing. He made every effort to stop where we can take a few photos and just enjoy the beautiful view. It definitely has to be in one of your list to do if you're ever here in Seattle. It's also not far from the city which makes it more worth it. I promise you, you will not be disappointed.

It was about 30-45 minute wait to get in. It was a beautiful drive that it very slow and windey. The drive is a bit scary, though, as it has no guardrail and your car could got tumbling down a steep cliff with one wrong move. Despite the scary drive, this park features stunning views of Mount Rainier which is the highest mountain in the Cascade Mountain Range. We saw numerous stops along the way for hiking trails and stops at waterfalls. To finish off the trip, we drove to Sunrise Visitor Center which unfortunately closed before we made it. Even though it closed before we made it, the drive up to Sunrise gets you to the highest stop that you can drive to at 6100 feet."

A true gem is Mt. Rainier."
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Mount Rainier,Mountains,5.0,The most luxuriant and the most extravagantly beautiful of all the alpine gardens I ever beheld in all my mountain-top wandering,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Paradise Washing is one of the most beautiful places in America. It has some of the best views of Mount Rainer which is not only the highest peak in Washington State, but also the highest peak in the Cascade mountain Range that stretches from British Columbia, Canada to Sonoma County, California. There are many great trails you can see from here, the most popular being the skyline trail. You get the best views from here and can hike up to Camp Muir, which is the base camp for those who wish to summit Mount Rainer. Camp Muir, named after John Muir the father of the National Parks, who said this about Mount Rainer, “…the most luxuriant and the most extravagantly beautiful of all the alpine gardens I ever beheld in all my mountain-top wanderings.” What a quote from the man who has pretty much seen every major mountain top in the USA. Whether you are spending a day or a month in this area, you will not be disappointed. Also be sure to go to check out all the nearby falls. "
Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Mount Rainier,Mountains,5.0,Glorious,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Why am I even bothering to write this review, when of course you already know that this is a stunning, magnificent place, filled with magic and wonder!  If only I could, I would come back in July and August and stay at the Paradise Inn and head out in the night to see the stars!  And the wildflowers!  Now at Paradise when we went, there is a sign in the Visitors Center stating that ""there are no paths that are free of snow"". lol!  People just a few days ago are still skiing at Paradise.  When you enter the park via the Paradise entry, make sure you stop at Longmire - so much history here!  You'll visit Ricksecker Point, Narada Falls, stop at all of the gorgeous falls along the way.  Even if you have only one day (which is all that we had), you have the opportunity to take this mystical place in, to feel the solitude, the glory - spectacular!  If clouds are covering the peak, wait, be patient - the clouds and mist generally lift.  And wow, the volcano emergency exit signs as you are leaving!  Rainier is an active volcano, it's been several hundred years since it's last eruption, but it is still active!"

Mount Rainier National Park,Washington (WA),Mount Rainier,Mountains,5.0,Good planning...great trip!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is an amazingly beautiful and awesomely exciting park to visit. Views of mount Rainier are spectacular and views of the surrounding areas are sweet. BUT, if you want a good experience, you need to plan carefully. First, don't try to see too much in one day. We visited Sunrise only, and did one hike only (the Mount Fremont Lookout Trail) because we only had a few hours. Certainly we could have done more than we did had we stayed the whole day, but I would suggest not to visit multiple areas in one day as it can become too stressful. Second, make sure to arrive early to avoid the crowds. We arrived by 8:00 and were able to drive right in with plenty of parking, and at that point, there was not much crowding on the trail. We tried to come here once before in the afternoon and they would not even let us in the gate because of the crowds. Third, be sure to pick a day (or days) that is NOT a weekend or holiday. We chose to visit on a Wednesday...maximum enjoyment. Finally (and this may be the hardest part) go the the park on a clear day. For most people, this is hard to plan for, and I know people who visited the park and never saw the top of Rainier because of clouds. At the end of the day, with good planning, this is clearly one of the most wonderful National Parks in the USA."

Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Square Tower House,Geologic Formations,4.5,Yes ... you can take a tour!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I've seen Ia couple of posts that say you can't see Square Tower House except from the overlook.  Not true!  There is a special hike that goes down to the site.  Its well worth the trip, though its not the easiest descent to the site.  If you are afraid of heights, or have any concern about your upper body strength, don't try this one.  I am 57 years old and in reasonably good shape and made it fine, but the hike out (or UP) will test your lung capacity.  Otherwise, don't miss it.  You can see a lot more of the site from ""ground"" level than from the overlook."

It was amazing. We had to buy it in advance on the NPS website & it cost $25/person, but it was a small, longer tour of a long past place. Like  stepping back in time. We learned so much about the site & the history of the Ancestral Puebloans. Also the nature & environment of the area & relationship with other cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde. Worth every dime & more. Head's up - it's a steep climb up & down so make sure you're ready for the challenge. Very fun experience!"

Not many people seem to do this trail as it is perceived as difficult.  I am in my sixties and did it in less than one hour!  Had to, dinner was calling…  Enjoy it."

Do this hike first.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the first real hike you come to after entering the park. The trail begins in the campground and takes you to the top of the mesa for wonderful views to the north, west, and east. The trail guide says two hours but an average hiker will complete the round trip in less than 1.5 hours. The trail is clear with easy switchbacks. Just remember to pace yourself if this is your first hike of the day at this elevation. And of course bring water - and more water. Sunscreen too. And a hat."

In fact, it was a lot closer than our other views of Cliff House, Oak House and Square House. The archeology center and museum was closed, but the main visitor center by the park entrance had limited hours. I would recommend you go to Spruce Tree House before Mesa Top road due to some of the one way streets. The picnic area was really nice, but be prepared for some tight roads and some mud."

Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Spruce Tree House,Ancient Ruins,4.5,Not possible to walk inside but beautiful from outside.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is the third largest dwelling of Mesa Verde. It is located at the end of the Chapin mesa. It takes over an hour to arrive to this site from the Park entrance. There is a very good parking area. The Spruce House is not open to the public. It has been closed for several years. Years ago, it was possible to visit the dwelling on your own. The area is unstable and currently under restoration. You can only see it from the distance. Nevertheless, it is not too far from the view point at the Mesa Top; subsequently, you can detail the dwelling very well.  The best view is from behind the Ranger's house; there is a bench there and the views are stunning.  It is easier to notice the dwelling details in the afternoon."

They easily view and accessed from the main parking lot here.  Unfortunately, they are closed to visitation for falling rocks from the roof.  In some ways there are bigger and better ruins in the park.  However, what we heard from the ranger what is the real value to Spruce Tree House is that the roofs remain in-tact, meaning only here you can see the  ruins as they were meant to be seen.  Despite the closure I was able to get some pictures of the Spruce Tree house, from the return of the Petroglyph hike at the end."

You get to climb down into an actual Kiva, the roof has been reconstructed so you don't need to imagine 80-100 logs, you actually see it.   It was not crowded when we went so I stayed down for a while....  I get how it is such a spiritual place.  There are 2 Rangers down there and they answer questions and tell stories.  "
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Spruce Tree House,Ancient Ruins,4.5,"A smaller dwelling, but one you can explore at your own pace.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"After seeing Balcony House and Cliff Palace, you may be a tad disappointed with Spruce Tree House.  However, it's still a very good dwelling to visit and shouldn't be missed.  One reason is that it's the only dwelling that has a covered kiva that you can take a ladder down into to view.  Since you aren't on a tour, you can explore it at your own pace.  It has some wonderful dwellings/open roofed kivas to see.  You're also able to view the back of the dwelling where it's a bit darker and is away from the crowds.  For a moment, you sort of get a feeling of what it was like to call this place ""home""."

Most of the sites here require guided tours so this is also your place to start if you want to visit one of the archeological sites.

The monument in general is confusing without this place explaining who was there why how and when it was occupied.  Interpretive displays really make sense of it.

Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Park Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Astounding Views in Every Direction,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Park Point is the highest point in Mesa Verde N.P. at 8,427 feet, and its 360-degree views were cited during Congressional debate to establish the park in 1905.   The distance you can see will depend on the weather, of course.  I could see Shiprock, 32 miles to the south in New Mexico, the San Juan Mountains 45 miles to the north, the LaPlata Mountains just east, and the Sleeping Ute Mountain just west.  The turn off for Park Point is about 10 miles from Highway 160 or 6 miles from the Morefield campground turnoff; as the signage is subtle, just look for a right turn a little ways after the tunnel if you're going into the park or a left turn just after the Geologic Viewpoint if you're leaving the park.  It's worth turning around if you miss it the first time!  Once you reach the parking lot, there is a short paved path uphill to the fire lookout and you can walk all the way around that station to enjoy the views.  I think a wheelchair could be pushed up the hill but have no personal experience with one yet.  There is a booklet on Park Point available at the information desks for 50 cents."

It includes the Mesa Top loop and the Cliff Palace loop. We visited in October and the Cliff Palace road was closed; it closes during winter. The Mesa Top loop is actually quite nice; you need to have a car or ride a bike as it is long. It has many stops and to find a place where to park is easy This was our experience on an October afternoon. There are several villages and pit houses with a lot of written information; there are several view points from which you can see the Navajo canyon, the Tower House, the Cliff Palace (you can see from several view points), and many other small dwellings.  At the end of the loop you will find the Sun Temple with the classic ""D"" shape that has astronomical interest. If you don't have tickets to see a dwelling, don't worry; this road offers you a lot of information and wonderful memories. You may need two or three hours to drive the Mesa Top loop to appreciate everything it has to offer."

If you just want to drive and stop at viewpoints, allow 3-4 hours. If you plan on taking either of the two tours or hiking any of the trails, it's a full day experience."

A stop at the visitor center-museum-park theater will give the visitor plenty of background.  And a quick trip into Spruce House will give the onsite ruins experiene.  So if the tours are all-sold out or don't fit into one's itinerary, then drive Ruins Road East and West (about 12 mi total) and experience the ruins from the rim, the thunder and lightning shows, and the parking lot congestion.  You can definitely say you were at Mesa Verde from Ruins Road!"

I'm not used to driving something like this.  Take it worse they let people towing and driving RVs go up this way.  Add to that the tandem trucks bringing stone up for some road improvements and you can have some sticky situations.  Maybe people who live out west are used to this, but not me!"

The Petroglyph Loop Trail, about 3 mi., is very cool & followed an ancient foot path along the edge of the canyon cliff, passes by a small cliff dwelling & then to the panel of glyphs & then just a little farther there are steps up to the top of the cliff & then an easy walk back. If you want an easier version, you can make a left turn at Spruce Tree House & walk along the top till you get to the stairs down to the glyphs but they are a bit steep. The canyon views along the way are breathtaking!"

The hike is mostly on narrow trail, with lots of big rocks, and you have to pay attention despite the magnificent scenery distracting you.  Bring water (and your camera).  You really do have to scramble up rocks to reach the return trail, although, again the view from the top is rewarding.  Also, the return trail is much easier, flatter, etc.  You get a close up view of the rock carvings, and they are easy to view (not in a dark cave or anything like that)."

Has a portion that is pretty tough and not a place you want your hand full of stuff.  Take water as you get a unexposed part most of midday.  Interlinks so you cn do a circle around big ruins and see some views only in shape hikers are going to get.  Best hike in park for us will make this top priority if we go back.

It starts at Spruce Tree House, and makes a loop. We evidently went ""the wrong way"", and did it clockwise, while it's supposed to be done counterclockwise, but no one really seemed to mind. Some tough spots, but not too tough at all. The NPS folks did an INCREDIBLE job of creating ""steps"", carved right out of the existing rocks in most instances. Very very very cool. You're in the shade some and in the sun - be sure to take water! Enjoy the beauty and history, and get in some good exercise! We saw older folks (70s? maybe early 80s?) and kids (youngest was probably 5 or so, I would NOT take a child younger than 4!)."
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Petroglyph Point Hike,Historic Sites,4.5,Well Worth The Hike!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We are from Florida and this was the first time my two boys (11 & 7) had gone on any type of hiking.  We originally were just going to see the cliff dwellings but when they saw the sign for the hike they were adamant about going.  The bottom half of the hike is absolutely beautiful.  It is mostly shaded and the trail is not flat.  There were plenty of rocks to climb and a couple of narrow points between rocks to get through.  Before making the climb up you have to climb a very large rock which was about three foot or more with nothing to hold onto.  Thankfully there was a young man that had passed us and stayed to give me a lift.  The climb up was strenuous for us but beautiful which helped take our minds off of the workout.  We got to the top which was flat but directly in the sun.  The views from the top are breath taking.  Head others warnings and take PLENTY of water.  If we ever get back up here I will definitely do this again.

The first was a woman and was very snippy and in my opinion rude. I know it must be monotonous answering the same questions over and over, but that is why she is there. Each person that visits her desk probably asks the same questions. The second ranger was impatient as well... not letting me fully ask my question before he interrupted with what he thought I was going to ask. So I needed to repeat myself. AS FOR THE TOUR... it is excellent! The rangers down in the dwelling were informative and seemed genuinely interested in telling the story. The mile walk in is paved and pretty level. The walk down into the dwelling is more challenging because it is downhill, therefore uphill on the way out, but it is not very long. Bring water! The rangers have you set your backpacks, walking sticks, water bottles etc. at the bottom of the ladders so you don't need to lug them around during the tour."

I'm so glad that we got tickets and were able to visit it, since Cliff Palace is currently closed. It is quite the drive from the park entrance (about 45 minutes) with lots of switchbacks, no guardrails, etc, so mentally prepare yourself for the drive you'll have to and from the location. But once there it's great! From the parking lot, there is nothing to see. You have to walk approximately 10-15 minutes to where the ""tour"" starts. It's not much of a tour, just a park ranger checking your tickets and telling you a couple of things about the dwelling. From there you then walk another 5-10 minutes on a trail to get to the Long House. You'll get great photos as you come up on it and then you get to climb a couple of ladder to get ""inside"" it. You're never actually inside since everything is open to the air and there is no roof or fully enclosed walls. There are a few rangers stationed about that will tell you about different parts of the house. It's really up to you as to how long you hang around and look at things before treking back. The walk from where they will check your tickets to the parking lot is full sun, so wear your sunblock/hat. From the same parking lot you'll be able to access the Step House without a tour ticket. It's quite the hike in the full sun too. (Step house is ok, but really unimpressive if you've already visited Long House.)"

However, do not miss this one as it is so much less crowded and more accessible.  What it lacks in a perfect picture spot like Cliff Palace, it makes up in buildings and access.  Here you get to climb behind the structures and see a real seep that would have supplied water to those living here.  For me, the access into the dwellings allow you to see so much more.  Additionally, you can actually purchase a ticket to see these dwellings on the day of Sunday visit as opposed to Cliff Palace and Balcony House that sell out the first day they open.  "

The nice hike switchbacks down the mountain until you come around the corner and see the spectacular Long House. After taking pictures from afar, we moved closer and   got to explore individual rooms and meander around the place, wondering what it was like to live there. Rangers are there to answer your questions, or you can just￼ gawk and enjoy the views. My wife has limited mobility with knee issues, but was determined to do this trail, and did so despite the uphill return, just going slow and steady and taking breaks. Truly anyone can do it."

Once there we were greeted by a friendly ranger that gave us some information. We began the hike down the stairs and switchback. Half the group was in a hurry to get down and we had an older gentleman that was having issues so I stayed back and luckily I did as I had to help him when he fell climbing down some natural cut stairs. The tour was great as you got back and in the houses and saw the natural springs and the wood that was cut centuries ago. Our guide was very informative and helped us understand daily life there. On the hike out the monsoon started and it was a very wet hike back.
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Long House,Ancient Ruins,5.0,An experience you will treasure,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This was an incredible experience, but be aware that it is a nail biting, curvy, switchback filled ride to the Wetherill Mesa. It took about an hour to go 12 miles. The reward is a breathtaking walk back in time to an ancient village tucked into the alcove of a cliff, dating to 1200 AD. The walk to the trailhead was easy and paved. The hike down the cliff is steep, narrow and sandy so wear good hiking shoes. Take a lot of water and keep your kids under a close eye because the cliff has sheer drops. The two ladders were easy, so don’t be afraid. They have a landing in between so you can catch your breath if you need to. The rangers were knowledgeable and answered your questions, rather than giving you a lecture. You could move about the site at your own pace. There is a steep staircase on the way to the cliff. I wouldn’t use a pole so that both hands are free. The experience was unparalleled. To think there is such ancient history in the U.S. is mind blowing! We also saw wild horses on a nearby trail after the tour."

I visited Mesa Verde many years ago and loved our return.  We signed up for the 11am tour with rangers which is a perfect time.  Its not too hot and we have plenty of time to get to the trail head.  The hike in is not taxing unless you're really elderly or in really bad shape.  You get to climb a ladder up into the ruins,  but are reminded not to touch anything.  The 3 rangers that we met were wonderful,  informative & friendly.  Skip the food in the park.  Its aweful.  I wish we brought a cooler with food."

Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Balcony House,Historic Sites,5.0,Made it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I am claustrophobic and a plus-sized woman, and I was really nervous about the tunnel at the end of this tour. I am writing this review to give folks information that could be helpful. I am 5' 7"" and 240 lbs. I got through the tunnel pretty quickly. I felt slightly stuck during the first half, but was able to propel myself through without a problem. It opens up in the middle before getting narrow again, which helps. Also, I was able to get through on my hands and knees... I didn't have to try to go through sideways. The test tunnel at the visitor's center near the park entrance was a good indicator of what the actual tunnel was like, even if it was smoother than the actual tunnel. Since it's so hard to get tickets, I would suggest you do what I did: log on the second tickets go on sale (two weeks before, I think) buy them, and try out the test tunnel at the visitor's center. If you decide not to go at that point, there will be someone at the center without a ticket that would be happy to use it instead. It's only $8, so it could be worth a shot! I felt elated afterwards that I made it through and overcame my fears. Happy exploring!"

The tour involves a lot of steps, first down and then up, climbing up ladders, and crawling through a short tunnel.  Just enough to make the tour memorable and fun.  The ladders do get really hot to the touch so if you have sensitive hands, bring some gloves.  Of course, Balcony House itself is the star, but the journey to and from makes it more memorable than the equally fascinating Cliff Palace tour."
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Balcony House,Historic Sites,5.0,Lots of fun and interesting.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"I really enjoyed this. You have to get tickets at the visitor center. It was four dollars each. You have to climb three ladders about 10-15 feet in height and pretty steep. Also, you have to crawl through a tunnel about five feet long. If you have compromised knees you may want to pass. The tunnel is not long but the floor is solid rock, and you can only fit through by crawling. OK, that's the fun part. The interesting part is the presentation by the Ranger.  Very interesting and about 20 minutes long. If I ever get back to Mesa Verde I will be doing this again."

Yes there are many ruins in park and tours of several; however, this is the largest and most in tact site.  Thank goodness they offer several tours so while everyone wants to see, you can likely get a ticket for some time during the day.  Still order your tickets from the NPS site before you go.

Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Cliff Palace,Historic Sites,5.0,The Main Attraction,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is what you're in Mesa Verde to see.  This is the spot you see on brochures, websites, etc.  You can get solid views from the overlook above (Cliff Palace Loop on the park map) and from across the way on the Mesa Top Loop (near where the Sun Temple is labeled on the map).  We paid an extra $8 per person to do a Ranger-assisted tour where you get to go down to these cliff dwellings and see them up close.  It only takes about 25-30 minutes and was well worth it, as it is much less crowded and you are literally standing in/around the Cliff Palace.  One caution, the steps to get down are a little steep in parts and you do need to climb 4 ladders in total while on the path (1 on the way, 3 in succession to get back out).  The ladders are sturdy and easy to climb, but I could see some people getting nervous if you're not a fan of heights or tight spaces.  That said, I'm a big guy and had a minor knee injury at the time and was still able to do it pretty easily."

We took the tour, which required descending some steep and narrow steps to the level of the ruins and after the tour required climbing up some steep steps and at least three, steep ladders. As a senior, this was difficult and strenuous. You should make sure to take water with you if you elect to take this tour, which requires that you have advance reservations.  You can however view the ruins without taking the tour from a viewing platform which is an excellent place to take photos."

One wonders how anyone found this spot, as it is literally out in the middle of nowhere, with few apparent resources to support life. We were fortunate to visit in early November during Covid, so we had the entire park virtually to ourselves. Unfortunately, the normally available tours were not offered due to covid restrictions. However, the loop drives and overlooks, normally crowded with cars and people, were deserted, greatly enhancing the experience. Also, the weather was mild, in the upper 60's, which was also welcome."

I was surprised that there were so many cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde,  not just the few big ones. The area of Cliff Palace is like the “downtown” area with many of them close together."

Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Grand Avenue Tour,Nature & Wildlife Tours,4.0,Too rushed to enjoy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,The cave is unquestionably beautiful and this route is amazing. Unfortunately we were not given the opportunity to appreciate it because the guide was just trying to get it over with as quickly as possible. He was also demeaning and sexist.

Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Grand Avenue Tour,Nature & Wildlife Tours,4.0,"Lots of cave to see, but not a lot of different cavescapes",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The tour is 4 miles over 4 hours.  hey warn you ahead of time to not go if you have any health issues, but you cover the 4 miles in 4 hours and get to stop and rest after the uphills and stairs so it's not that difficult.  The tour is mostly just mostly walking and looking, with not much info from guided except at a few spots.  There were 2 guides on our tour with just less than 80 people, but only the lead guide did the talking.  The 2nd guide just followed in the back to be sure everyone kept going. If you are imagining 4 hours of pretty rocks, stalactites and stalagmites, you will be disappointed.  While the gave in general is cool, there are only a few different features throughout this tour, some just last for a mile or two, for example the gypsum deposits.  The last 20 minutes is the portion with stalactites and stalagmites, so if that's all your looking for, this tour is not for you. The allure of this tour is to cover 4 of the 420 miles of cave, as  I believe this is the longest length of cave you can cover in 1 tour . There are 2 bathroom stops along the way, approx. 1 hour in  and 2 hours in. You can bring water but no snacks.  They say you don't need a headlamp or flashlight, and you technically don't, but a bright flashlight would be nice to look at some features as you walk by.  The cave is 55 degrees F year round, but we went on a 80-ish degree day and while some people used their sweatshirts, many others were just fine in their shorts and t-shirts as you keep moving most of the time.  If you are doing this during a cooler time of year and aren't entering the cave already hot you will likely want long sleeves and probably pants as well.  The guide names a lot of the areas in the cave things like Cleveland Ave, the Grand Canyon, etc... and offered to highlight where we went on a map afterwards, but the maps were sold out at the gift shop.  A map ahead of time would have been nice."

As we waited for the bus to take us to the entrance the rangers warned us of the dangers; let us know it would be a long walk and if we weren't in shape this was not a good tour to be going on; and educated us about the area and the decline of the bat population and how we could make as little impact as possible.

If you are going for stalactites and beautiful formation just take the Frozen Niagara tour or go to a different cave because Mammoth is know for it's size, not it's formations. That said, Mammoth is a very cool place and just goes on forever! This tour takes you through places like the slot canyons out west and is really impressive. The rangers were excellent. I would recommend a head lamp because there are spots were there are huge pits that are not lit. This is not a photography tour and while you can get pics during the stops it is hard to get them on the go with the shutter speeds necessary, def need a real camera with a high ISO. There are two bathroom stops. There is one spot with a steep almost ladder like stair. As far as difficulty, we are in the 26-35 age range, pretty active and would not call this strenuous at all. Even the hills did not have us breathing hard but make sure you eat before this if you have any blood sugar concerns. Some areas are slick. The number were were told was 470 stairs, about 40-50 flights, over the course of four hour, with the option to leave at the snowball room."

Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Grand Avenue Tour,Nature & Wildlife Tours,4.0,Another part of Mammoth Cave,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This tour works well as a duo with the Historic tour as it takes you into a different part of the cave than the Historic tour. This one is longer and a bit more strenuous at 4 miles/4 hours. But while it claims to be the most strenuous tour outside of the wild cave tour, it really isn't bad. Lots of downhill walking and steps that while easy, made my calves a little sore the next day. If you're claustrophobic, which I am a bit, this tour is pretty open - just one relatively narrow canyon to walk through, but other than that nothing to worry about. Ranger Sue was great as she was very informative and passionate about the cave. The grand finale was fantastic as you end with beautiful stalagmite formations. You get a lot of bang for your buck on this tour as it encompasses the Frozen Niagara route, Domes and Dripstones route and the Snowball route. So lots to see in one all inclusive trip."
Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Gothic Avenue Tour,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,No Fear Cave Exploration!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This tour of the Rotunda and Gothic Avenue is an excellent introduction to caving for those like me with fear of being underground.  These cave sections are huge - dare I say mammoth!  Seriously, they are way bigger than you can imagine!  No stooping or squeezing by anything!  No wet spots so no slipping.  No visible bats or insects either!  Just plain cool!  And yes, that means the temperature, too.  About 55 degrees.  I wore shorts, sweat jacket, and tennis shoes.   Most of the steps are located at the entrance/exit, but there were about 5-6 others joining the main cave with Gothic Avenue.  I am 60 yo and have two hip replacements, and I did absolutely fine. The tour guide did a great job; the social history of the cave was totally fascinating.  The tour was scheduled for 2 hours, but we ran about 15 min over which was no problem.  More time enjoying this natural phenomenon!  I included some photos, but it was really difficult to get good photos due to the lighting.  I recommend the Frozen Niagara tour after this tour which is still rather open, but you do need to stoop for a short distance and you do need to watch your step a little."
Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Gothic Avenue Tour,Sightseeing Tours,4.5,Great tour!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My husband and I really enjoyed this tour. We have been in about five caves before this, and this one was different than our previous caving experiences. There aren’t as many formations as other caves (at least not on this tour), but the passageway you walk through is large and unique. This tour would be perfect for someone who is uncomfortable with tight spaces. I also want to note that in the description it says something about not being good for people with a fear of heights. I am terrified of heights, and I didn’t have any issue with this tour. I was really nervous prior to going about what the disclaimer was about, but I decided I would try it anyway.  After taking the tour, I believe the disclaimer is in reference to the stairs into the historic entrance. It is a pretty long staircase, however, it is not open to the ground below so it didn’t bother me at all. They are concrete stairs with sturdy handrails so I felt completely safe."

You will have opportunities to catch your breath during stops while your guide explains features of the cave.  In my opinion body size is more of a limitation than physical ability.  I am 64, weigh approximately 175 lbs, and had minimal difficulty getting through the tight spots.  Incidentally, I first did the Wild Cave tour back in 1971 and this one in June 2012 was my third trip.  Each one was different. "

The tour leaders are fantastic and worked very hard to help my mother get out of the cave after her injury - we were already more than halfway through and the only way out was to finish the tour and gut it out through the pain. I'm writing to warn people that this tour is very, very physically challenging and has the possibilities of very serious injuries. I never would have expected the tour to be as difficult as it was.

In the first 2 challenging hours, we squeezed through the tight “bare hole” and “birth canal” passages that can be read about in previous reviews, along with a few other precarious squeezes while doing a whole lot of crawling on our hand and knees.  After stopping for lunch in the Snowball room and dropping our knee pads to allow the sweat from them to dissipate, our guides Michael and Emily (both fantastic btw) anounced that our group had done so well in the first 2 hours that they were going to take us to a “special” place that very few groups get to go through."

Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Wild Cave Tour,Nature & Wildlife Tours,5.0,"Awesome and incredible, but very difficult!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The wild cave tour is a must for anyone seeking adventure.  It is very physically demanding and challenging.  This is not for the overweight or out of shape couch potato.  They are very serious about the 42"" size limit, as we had two larger young guys on our trip and neither of them could fit through the first two openings we came out of.  However, there are alternate ways around, so they just backed out of the hole and one of our guides walked them around another way.  One of the guys decided at the lunch stop not to continue the trip, but the other toughed it out.  We never had to squeeze through another small opening on the trip, which may have been due to the fact that we had the larger guys in our group.  They put you through a series of tunnels in the beginning to test everyone's ability both as an individual and how well you work together as a group, and then the guides determine the best places to continue the tour.  One of the holes you come out of is right off one of the main trails that another tour (Grand Avenue) takes and our group was coming out of the hole when they were going through, so we had an audience, which was cool.  Our group did well enough to be able to have the option of exiting through the compass needle passage which was very challenging, especially after hours of caving.  You cover about 6 miles of cave in 6 hours and travel at a very fast pace, with about a half hour stop for lunch in the snowball room (which also has bathrooms, much to my surprise).  You will stop to rest along the way in between and also discuss strategy when it is necessary for some of the more technical ascents/descents.  Some areas you may be walking through narrow passages, others you have to crouch down, even if you are short, and some you are crawling on your hands and knees, and then some you are crawling on your stomach.  My muscles are really sore, I have scraped up knees, elbows and shins, and a few bruises.  I brought my own knee pads, which were great because the ones they give you have been worn a lot and the elastic is stretched out and many people ended up with their knee pads on their shins a lot of the time and had to constantly pull them up.  If you do bring your own, they make you leave them there (because of the risk of spreading white nose syndrome), so buy some cheap ones and just plan on not getting them back.  Some people also wore elbow pads, but again, those slipped off a lot."

I opted for one of the interpretive trails, and the ranger recommended the Cedar Sink Trail.  I hit the trail at about 130pm; hot!  In the spring the trail is also known for abundant wildflowers, but today I was just enjoying the shade provided by the fairly dense tree canopy.  The trail gradually descends through some beautifully mature juniper (""cedar"") trees. The trail then drops down to one of the sinks via a metal staircase and levels out.  There are some observation decks where you can look down into the sink; very interesting geological phenomena. The rail continues on and then another metal staircase going up.  The trail diverts to a beautiful overhang that looks like something out of an Indiana Jones movie, as others have said.  The trail is closer to 2 miles long than 1.  I highly recommend this trail."

There is about a 60F wind blowing out of the cave, which feels great going in, the humidity and temp is low, but coming back out, you have to face reality!

(With a small warning),5.0 of 5 bubbles,I think that the only reason why they even mention Fat Man's and Tall Man's Misery before the tour is if you are not able to bend and weave through that portion.  I am a big gal (size 4X) with back problems and I did just fine.  It was actually a lot of fun and gave me a chance to feel like a little kid again.  If you are a larger person you know that you have to fit through tight spaces all the time so this is nothing new.  It is a beautiful cave and well worth that small portion of uncomfort.  If you are claustrophobic - forget about it!  Go on Frozen Niagra.  Once you are down in the cave it may be hours before you can get out if you have a panic attack and cannot go further.

Even for larger sizes! ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Ok, so I want to start this by saying that I alllllmost didn’t go on the Historic tour just because I feared that I wouldn’t fit through this. And the reviews I read gave me mixed feelings. So, to hopefully help someone like me out, I want to be clear. It was NO big deal. I wear size 20W or XXL bottoms and was fine! Yes, I had to “squeeze,” a bit so did everyone. I was surprised by how much room I really had! People larger than me could’ve easily fit. You’re following a path that is narrow at the bottom, but open above the waist. My kids loved it, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had maneuvering through it! Fat Man’s Misery was not miserable in the least! So much fun!"

The space is narrow to about hip height and larger above the waist with side head and shoulder room. Thus the feeling of a tall narrow squeeze and claustrophobic tightness does not happen. "

Drove from Durango and spent about 3-4 hours seeing the main sites.  Stopped at visitor center to use restroom. No tours at this time, but you are still able to drive around and stop at each site.  When you pay to enter park, they give you a map and if you have kids, they give them each a ranger badge and an activity book.  We did a few of the look-out points (some have about a 5 minute walk to them) and then did the main sites in the park.  It is a good drive throughout the park with absolutely beautiful scenery.  Definitely worth the drive from Durango.  We could have spent more time, but had to get back to Durango for another adventure."

Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Mesa Verde National Park,National Parks,4.5,Very unusual and very enjoyable.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This review should be most helpful to visitors who wish to do minimal hiking/walking, who enjoy spending most of the time driving, or who do not plan to pay for any of the popular tours of the ruins. We had a wonderful experience even without the tours. We arrived at the park the day they started shutting things down for COVID, so the tours were not available. The park was extremely enjoyable though, even without the tours. In fact we almost had the entire park to ourselves. The road up into the mesa had great views of the surrounding areas. Be sure to stop at some of the overlooks. My favorite was the Park Point Overlook...make sure to hike up to the fire lookout.  You can see everything from there. Since we were here in March, we only did the drives on Chapin Mesa. We stopped at the main parking lot and walked out to see the Spruce Tree House--very cool. We then very slowly and very leisurely drove around both the Mesa Top Loop and the Cliff Palace Loop, stopping at each and every pullout. We obtained a guide brochure at the first Pit House on the Mesa Loop which was very helpful along the way. I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy seeing a bunch of ruins, but it was marvelous and beautiful at every stop. My favorite stops on the Mesa Loop were the First Pit House, the Square Tower House, the Sun Point View, and the Sun Temple. At the Sun Point View, you can see about a dozen different ruins up and down a couple of canyons...amazing. The park has great signage at each stop indicating the names of each ruin as well as the time period they are from. My favorite stop on the Cliff Palace Loop was of course the Cliff Palace. Make sure to park and walk out to the overlook on the north side of the ruin. The Balcony House is also on the Cliff Palace Loop, but it is not visible from the road. It is apparently only visible if you hike out the Soda Canyon Overlook Trail (which we did not do), or take a guided tour (not available to us since the park was closing). By the time we finished these two loops, my experience seemed very complete and very satisfying. Finally, as we started our journey back out of the park, we stopped briefly at Cedar Tree Tower for one final experience with ruins. Very nice. I am so glad we finally made it to this national park (my 28th). This is one very amazing place! I'd love to come back some time and take the tours, but I definitely can say that taking in the park as we did was very fulfilling and felt very complete.  If you wish to replicate this trip,  it took us 4-5 hours."
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Mesa Verde National Park,National Parks,4.5,Beautiful Park but Still Too Much Closed,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful park with amazing ruins but I was disappointed at how much was still closed. We had tried to get a ruins tour before we came and they were limiting it to two ruins with a max of 10 people at a time, twice a day, so they were sold out immediately. The road to Cliff Palace is currently closed, which we knew about, but we weren't expecting so many ruins and trails, and the museum to be closed as well. We were going to walk down by the Spruce House but the trail was also closed due to a bear with her cubs so we were quite limited on what we could do other than take the drive and stop at the pull outs. The ruins are amazing but if I had to do it all over again I would wait until everything was open again and stay at the lodge for the night."

Because of Covid-19 some of the attractions were closed off. Which just meant some of the attractions we could see from afar just not up close. Even so, what an amazing experience! I would think this might be the park to visit and pay for a guided tour so can get first hand knowledge of the history of the Pueblo people. It’s very humbling to see all they did to survive, hard to describe. "
Mesa Verde National Park,Colorado (CO),Mesa Verde National Park,National Parks,4.5,"Wonderful National Park, Underbuilt Parking, Museums Closed - NPS charges the same",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"I had wanted to visit this park since I was 9 - that was 60 years ago. Finally made it. I booked the Long House tour for 1130. My husband and I stayed in Cortez, got to the Park about 0900 and stopped by the visitor center which was of course closed except for the restrooms and gift store. NPS says it's about 90 minutes to Wetherill Mesa and the meeting point for the tour. BELIVE WHAT THEY SAY. We drove to Wetherill Mesa, had a hard time finding a place to park. Then, had to walk to the meeting point for the tour which was fine as long as you could find the place to park. The Longhouse Tour was great - getting to go up into a cliff dwelling and imagine what it would have been like to live there was just what I'd wanted. We'd brought noon snacks because there's no place to eat due to NPS nannyism on Covid so we had a nice snack on the way to Chapin Mesa. Got one of the last spots in the Cliff Palace parking lot. The museum was of course closed. Drove to all of the other overlooks. The day, without the museums which were closed went from 0900 to about 1600. It takes at least this long to see all there is to see. Parking is a horrible issue but until Congress gives more money to the National Park Service, things won't change. I'm sure they'll go to quotas in the not too distant future. The worst thing is Park Service is charging the same price as they would if all their services were still available - the museums were closed. Some restrooms were closed. Eating places were closed. Supposedly due to Covid but NPS really isn't following the science on that issue."

Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Mammoth Cave,Caverns & Caves,4.5,Take a historic tour. ,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"I took 2 tours during my visit: domes and dripstones and the extended historic tour. Domes and dripstones was absolutely not worth it and I would not recommend it to anyone. The pathways were wet and slippery. There wasn't much to see for a majority of the tour, and even the show features were incredibly limited compared to other caves. The whole tour is basically maneuvering narrow metal stairs and rough walkways for very little payoff for what you actually get to see. If you must see the show cave features, take the frozen niagara tour that only sees the small show section and skips out on the 500 wet stairs. The historic tour is where Mammoth Cave really shines. The wide open passages were unlike anything I had seen in cave systems before. The saltpeter mining was a really cool peak at history, and all throughout the tour there are smoke writings and carvings on the walls and ceiling of the cave from generations gone by. I went on the extended historic tour which also included a visit to an old experimental tuberculosis treatment area. The 2 huts that are visible were really neat to see as well as just getting to learn so much about that time from the guides. The stories the guides tell throughout the whole historic tour really being the cave to life and help you imagine what the cave was like during a variety of time periods. There are still a lot of stairs on the historic tour, but they are all even and much easier than the domes and dripstones stairs. The pathways are all relatively smooth and easy and the tour feels less like work and more like the opportunity to enjoy the cave that it should be. If I was rating Mammoth Cave based just on domes and dripstones it would be 0/5, but if I was rating it based just on the historic tour it would be a 5/5. "

I don't think that our tour guide was a park ranger, as he was simply wearing jeans and a hoodie (maybe he was filling in for Christmas break?).  It was evident that this may have been his first tour and he had a difficult time, both with the narrative and in controlling people.  Our tour had a large group (~60 people), and he had no control of those at the end of the line. They were always talking over him and exploring on their own, impacting what we got out of our tour.  "

Only tour available is the self guided historic. You’re going to need to buy tickets online in advance because it will sell out. That said it’s an easy walk and anyone with claustrophobic fears or anxiety about the dark should be assuaged. The cave has lots of lighting, and the walkway is mostly paved with a little bit of stone. Couple of small easy grade slopes. This is not an arduous hike by any means so you can definitely do it with young kids. It is cooler below so bring a light jacket or sweatshirt. "

The tour is the only one being offered currently during the pandemic. We purchased tickets online a couple of weeks in advance. It was fairly busy the day we went so I strongly recommend advance reservations. The tour is self-guided and begins at the visitor center. Each individual party is released a intervals to promote social distancing. Once inside the cave, we were able to explore over 2 miles of the cave system. Rangers were stationed at frequent intervals and were available to answer questions. It was very cold (54 degrees) inside the cave particularly in comparison to the 90 degrees outside. The history and geology of the massive cavern was wonderful! It is very hard to fathom how large the cave system until you actually enter. It highly recommend this cave tour. It’s a great way to get out and safely enjoy our natural resources even during the pandemic."

Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Mammoth Cave,Caverns & Caves,4.5,A National Park with one great attraction......cave tours,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a different type of National Park in that there's only one basic attraction (for non-hikers) and that's the various tours offered.  There's no driving around the park to see sights like at other parks.  And you better make your reservations in advance for the tours since they're sold out in the summer.  We took one ""easy"" tour as an introduction and then split into two different tours the next day.....one ""easy"" and one ""moderate"".  The National Park staff is wonderful and great tour guides and answer all your questions at the visitor center which also has an interesting small museum with exhibits and history.  We elected not to stay on the property since we couldn't get an air conditioned room and found it just as easy to stay in Cave City nearby and drive the 15 minutes or so to the Visitor Center where all the tours begin.  It's pretty dark and slippery down in the caves so I'm glad I wore hiking boots.  There are handrails for us elderly folks.  But the temperature is delightful in the hot summer months......I didn't need any jacket!  And, yes, the scenery is amazing down in the caves."
Mammoth Cave National Park,Kentucky (KY),Mammoth Cave,Caverns & Caves,4.5,Still worth a visit,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We did the 4 hour grand avenue tour.  Echoing many of the other reviews on here, we went through very quickly and weren't able to take many pictures or even just stop and enjoy the different formations.  There were 100+ people on the tour and it was hard to see and hear the guide that was speaking most of the time, and we were only in the cave around 3 hours.  There were 3 guides, 1 in front and 2 at the end, and the older lady guide at the end should not have been working with the public.  I asked her a question about other tours offered here and she was very annoyed that I spoke to her and only gave a curt response before she went back to her personal conversation with the other guide.  All that said, the inside of the cave is quite beautiful and $35 to see this natural beauty for 3 hours is still a bargain and worth seeing if you enjoy caves."

Tall Man's Agony is second part to Fat Man's Misery and you will remember both.  They are fun sections, especially children who may not have to duck.  If you are an adult you will be ducking and scrunch walking.  There are a few ""Wishing Rocks"", those are rocks after you hit that you wish were not there.

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),The Narrows,National Parks,5.0,An absolute must in Zion,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Such a fun and different experience, even for frequent hikers/travelers.  This hike is a must on a trip to Zion.  As most have already stated, I'd definitely recommend spending the cash for waterproof gear and hiking stick to help stay warm and keep your balance on the rocks.  We went in early April so the water was still pretty chilly but we were able to remain relatively comfortable all the way to Wall Street, however we passed many in shorts and an old pair of tennis shoes that looked the worse for wear.  Also be prepared for crowds depending on the time of day/year and understand that, even if the Narrows was completely empty, speeding through this hike isn't really an option.  You're going to spend most of the time walking along hidden rocks, through currents that could sweep you off your feet if you don't take your time and the water levels can vary from ankle to waist/chest deep.  That being said, this hike was unlike anything I've ever done before I highly recommend it."

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),The Narrows,National Parks,5.0,Unique Experience,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Amazing experience. Such a unique ""hike"". Started at sunrise on a cold February weekday morning. Even with 25F air temperature at 7am, I stayed plenty warm wearing 4 layers on top and 2 layers on the bottom  including wearing thermals. Gloves and hand warmers really helped and bring an extra pair of gloves as others have recommended. I had a small mishap on the return stepping into a trench with water up to my shoulders and my first pair of gloves got drenched. Dry bib package from Zion Outfitters worked great and the waterproof backpack that I added was quite helpful. Good boots and the hiking stick are needed. Feet are wet and cool with the Neoprene socks but not icy cold and very tolerable. I turned around at the end of Wall Street not too far past Floating Rock. Round trip took 6 hrs but I stopped a lot for photos. Best photography was on the return journey after 10am when the sun was overhead with light streaming down into the canyons. It was a Friday morning in February without shuttles running. Plenty of parking when I arrived just before sunrise. Beware that the rangers closed Zion Canyon Road later that morning to avoid overcrowding as many arrived at the Park for the weekend."

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),The Narrows,National Parks,5.0,Exciting adventure but you need to be prepared ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Let me start by saying I am a 57-year-old woman who does not exercise regularly and am a bit out of shape. In the Narrows, your traversing across and through a cold river from ankle to thigh depth 50% of the time! As such, you are stepping on lots of river rocks that you can see and not see. We feel very fortunate to get out of an 8 1/2 mile hike that was five hours long without twisting an angle on it. That being said, it’s a great adventure… Gorgeous Canyon views; I actually enjoy the cold water. What I want to strongly recommend is that you go to Zion guru or Zion outfitter’s and rent the neoprene socks and waterproof shoes with traction and a stick that really make a difference ($25 pp).  Because there is no shuttle taking you to the entrance of the Narrows and we had no desire to walk 6 1/2 miles each way to do it ourselves… We also pay $40 per person RT for transportation to and from the trailhead entrance.  How far you want to go it’s up to you… I would recommend at least a four hour hike...2 he’s in and 2 hours out.  If you’re in great shape you can double that!"
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),The Narrows,National Parks,5.0,Epic hike at Zion National Park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hiking The Narrows was our plan for our Zion National Park visit.  We thought we would aim for an early arrival on day one, but we weren’t early enough.  By the time we parked our car just outside the road closure for the scenic drive road, we learned we would have a six mile trek from that point just to get to the starting point of The Narrows.  As the car limit had been reached, we planned for a different approach on day two.  (Hint: You have to be at the park entrance extremely early, before that opens, for a shot at parking your car close to The Narrows trailhead)."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),The Narrows,National Parks,5.0,Memorable and worthwhile experience - but be well prepared!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My family of 5 (me and my wife, and our 16, 18, and 20 year old sons) hiked the Narrows this week (second week in March).  Weather was in the 40s and the water temp was in the mid 30s so we were apprehensive about how comfortable we’d be.  But we were appropriately outfitted (at the Zion Adventure Company) in a double layer of neoprene socks under our water hiking boots, appropriate clothing under our dry suits, and as a result we’re comfortable for our hike.  The rocks are very uneven and slippery so it was critical for us that we had our walking sticks - those are fantastic.  Our sons went at a faster pace than my wife and I.  We only had about 3 1/2 hours for our actual hike in the water.  My sons made it a little past Wall Street in that time, and my wife and I got to within a quarter mile of it.  We were walking on the side of the river where possible so my wife and I covered about a third of the hike on dry land and the rest in the water.  The greener the water the deeper it is!  And you can clearly see when it’s running faster.  So be strategic about charting your path, make sure you’re well equipped and enjoy the unique views and experiences.  It really is beautiful and as the lighting changes you notice different things in the rocks and canyons."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),The Narrows,National Parks,5.0,The Narrows with Kids,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Text: I had a lot of trepidation about bringing my 5 kids (9, 10, 15, 17, 19) on this hike. There were flash flood warnings the day before but I guess that is common this time of year. The weather is typically dry in the morning with rain moving in in the evening. They often recommend people don’t enter the narrows in the afternoon when rain is possible. Knowing this we headed in EARLY! We arrived in Zion at 6:15 am, took a shuttle and arrived to the trailhead at 7:15. We started our hike around 7:30 am. We hiked the first paved mile and then we entered the river portion by around 8 am. There were very few people on the trail and it was very peaceful. We hiked up the river and reached the Wall Street  by around 9:30. We went another 30 minutes and hiked just past the floating rock by 10 am. At that point, we turned around and headed back. We reached the paved trail at 11:50 am and the shuttle by 12:15. At this point, the river and paved trail was packed and there were many people just wandering in the water a bit and turning back. It was very crowded. Go early if you want peace and solitude. By the time we returned, the river was packed. "
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),The Narrows,National Parks,5.0,Bucket list adventure for all ages over 8-10 in good shspe,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A nephew posted his trip pics and convinced us we could do this hike. I am so glad we did but do not attempt this unprepared.   It seems most hikers rented equipment but we thought we could save the dough.  I ordered neoprene socks from swim outlet but the rental socks and flexible boots might have been a smarter choice.  We did know enough to bring hiking sticks and I cannot imagine being without.  
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),The Narrows,National Parks,5.0,Just do it!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Narrows is gorgeous and not as hard as I thought from reading reviews. The water is cold but you honestly get used to it within seconds because you're so overwhelmed and excited to be there. A walking stick was a life saver to most in our group but we did have a few of our teens skip it. Dont get too freaked out about shoes. Hiking shoes are probably the best but we had some in our party use old tennis shoes and even river shoes. One person lost BOTH the soles of his shoes (he brought REALLY old shoes) and his sock feet were sticking out of the bottom of what was left. He wasn't comfortable at times but he managed. Wool socks are the best but don't get all worried about shoes and clothing and just do it! Go EARLY....seems like the crowd really picked up around 11 and 12 and it was harder to fight them to get back to the start. We just did the hike on 6/1 and only got up to our hips once briefly. Most of the hike was ankle to knee deep. I think the best photo shots are early as well with the sun but it's beautiful there all day I'm sure. We started the hike around 9am and had to be back for our private shuttle by 145p so we turned around at the fork and then got back an hour too early. You definitely want to take your time and stop and look UP once in a while because you have to look down most of the time to find your next step.
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Riverside Walk,Hiking Trails,4.5,Nice Walk in Scenic Canyon,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a lovely, easy walk along the river at the north end of the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive.  It is very nice, offers great views of the scenery along the river, and is basically flat and easy to do.  Some parts may be muddy or slippery when it is wet or icy but  although we saw people with hiking boots, I can't image that is necessary for the riverwalk and we certainly didn't have any, even though there were some muddy or icy parts, and a little snow on the ground.  We were there in late December 2021 and it was chilly but not particularly cold during the day. At its end, this leads to the Narrows area, which involves a more strenuous and adventurous walk through the river narrows, in the river itself.  That looked fun and we intend to try it but we had to throw this trip together at the last minute so were not prepared to do anything like that, and had no time to, either."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Riverside Walk,Hiking Trails,4.5,Popular but delightful ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is short, easy and beautiful.

Still, I have nothing but good to say about the walk."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Riverside Walk,Hiking Trails,4.5,Beautiful Walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a must do if you are in Zion.  The fall colors were amazing and the walk is fairly easy and most of it paved (although parts of it you can walk the river edge, which is less crowded and more like hiking).  When you get on the shuttle at the visitor center, take it all the way to the end and start your Zion adventure here.  Everyone is required to get off here, as it is the last stop, making it easier to get a seat on the shuttle heading back to the other stops."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Riverside Walk,Hiking Trails,4.5,walk along the Virgin river,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This trail is not a difficult one, it said it is paved, it takes about 1.5 hour for the round trip. if you want to to go to Narrows, then you must walk this trail, as the end of the trail is the beginning of the trail of the Narrows. For the day that we went, the river water level may be higher than safety level, so the Narrows is closed, not allowed people to go to that trail. You have to check the condition for the Narrows in visitor center before hike. As the riverside walk is along the Virgin river, people will go into the river at some point, they may play in the water, but of course you have to take your responsibility for your safety. If you want to walk this trail, you have to get off at the last bus stop (#9) of the shuttle."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Riverside Walk,Hiking Trails,4.5,Beautiful But Too Crowded,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a beautiful Trail but there were so many people on it that it lost a lot of it's beauty.  We did not go all the way to the Narrows as we were advised by a ranger to not get into the water because of the dangerous algae, but many people were coming back obviously wet.  They discovered it when a dog drank from the water and died."

Although a limited menu a lovely riverside location. Then we discovered  a 2 km pathed walk along the far side of the river back to Peja. Scenic walk. You can detour back down into the town at various points. It might be hard to find the start if coming from town but walk along the southern side riverside walk and when it ends head up the hill and you should find the track. Local kids on bikes helped us out.

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Riverside Walk,Hiking Trails,4.5,Take some forays off of the pavement ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Busier path, but totally worth it. There were lots of people using the path just to walk to the narrows for the in-river walk, even though an algae bloom suggests they shouldn't be doing that this year. So it can be extra busy. Take the time to get off the paved path and into the sand by the river. It will slow you down, get you some better views, and make the trip more memorable."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Riverside Walk,Hiking Trails,4.5,Wonderful walk,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is your main starting point if you are going to Hike The Narrows on the bottom up route.  Tips are to start early, especially if you plan to keep walking into The Narrows.  the Riverside Walk is a lovely stroll.  Starting at The Temple of Sinawava, the beauty of the mountains is something to behold.  We took some time to marvel at the grandeur of these mountains which show their awe inspiring boldness in a way that is difficult to understand from photographs. Being in their presence is a unique and special experience."

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion's Main Canyon,Canyons,5.0,Most Amazing Canyon Experience in the NPS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Yes, Angel's Landing and the Narrows get the hype, but it is the canyon that you come to see in Zion National Park.  It is unlike other canyons in the National Park system in some many ways that it makes Zion special.  The thing you will notice here first compared to so many other canyons is the green vegetation and the way the colors contrast against each other.  Other canyons are grey or red with much less vegetation.  However, the most significant difference is you experience Zion from the bottom looking up as opposed to all the others like Grand Canyon, Canyonlands or the Black Canyon where you are above looking down.  The beauty and perspective have so much to do with creating one of the most amazing natural locations within the US or for that matter the world.  It is something you have to experience, and I highly recommend."

About half of it is car-free but can be visited by the excellent shuttle which comes every 5 minutes or so. A number of key hikes were closed due to recent rockfall -erosion is going on at a high pace- but we enjoyed ourselves hugely on the Kayenta trail to Upper Emerald Pool, and likewise on The Riverside walk to the Narrows. Exceptional if not unique in the world. "

The fact that you're on this site says that you already know that for sheer majestic beauty, Zion is really hard to beat.  Just riding the National Park Service bus (sorry, no private vehicles) from one end to the other will give you lots of vistas, but the real beauty is best seen when you get off the bus and hike one or more of the many trails.

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Shuttle,Scenic Drives,4.5,"Buy the ticket on line, in advance!",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"The shuttle is a good way to navigate transportation to the various trails, hikes, and stops throughout Zion National Park.  The fee is $1.00/ ride, but you will need an advanced reservation with a 1 hour window of time for your ride.  I am not sure if this is just a Corona-19-time rule, or a standing rule.  Not real convenient for hikers,  but it is the way to get to different points throughout the park.  The park entrance to stop 9 (the end of the line) is about 10 (uphill) miles.  We rented bicycles, and put them on the bus (front of bus rack)  and exited at stop 9 (Temple of Sinawava) for the Narrows river trail.  We ride our bikes back down hardly pedaling at all.  After a long day of walking and hiking, THAT was a treat!"

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Shuttle,Scenic Drives,4.5,There has to be a better way...........,3.0 of 5 bubbles,We had no problems with the shuttle system ONCE we “won” the computerized lottery to secure a time for the shuttle. The lottery is the problem — it is very difficult to operate and unwieldy.  We started the process at the designated 5pm time to secure a time for the next day — it was not a pleasant experience with either the software crashing or getting knocked out. There has to be a better way!
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Shuttle,Scenic Drives,4.5,run in summer time,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"for the Zion scenic drive, you can't drive your own car beyond the canyon junction point, so if you want to go to the other points along the scenic drive, you must take the shuttle bus, there were many people take the bus in summer time, you may have to wait for 20-30 min before you can get onto the bus due to the long queue, although the buses come to pick up people one by one at the visitor center terminals, it still take a period of time to load the people onto the bus, so prepare to wait for 20-30 at the bus terminal in visitor center in the morning (at about 9am). But it's the only choice in summer time, you no have no other choice, you must take this shuttle bus, unless you walk from one point to another on foot. There are 2 types of shuttles, one is older, one is newer, the older one has no air-conditioner, but the windows are open, so have breeze blow in, not very hot unless it's very crowded. There are recorded introduction to every stop on the bus when going from visitor center to the last stop (Temple of Sinawava), but no such service when you go from the opposite direction assuming that you have already listened to it once when you go up. But as you may need to take the shuttle for several times, you may listen to the same description more than one time."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Shuttle,Scenic Drives,4.5,Do not visit Zion during high season,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"The actual shuttle bus is run well. You can board any shuttle that leaves during or after your assigned time. For example, if you have an 8-9 ticket, you can still board at 10. However, securing a shuttle ticket is a nightmare. As others have said, you may not secure one at 5:00 pm. It is impossible to park at the visitor center if you arrive past 7:30 am, so be prepared to park in town and take the very inefficient Springdale town shuttle to the visitor center. Another option is riding an electric bicycle into the canyon. But at $100/pp, that is an expensive option, and you should reserve one ahead of time, since they sell out."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Shuttle,Scenic Drives,4.5,"wonderful, professional staff",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"It's such a shame that people can be rude and obnoxious when asked to follow the rules--in our case it was about wearing a mask on the shuttle.  The staff members (both on the shuttle and at the boarding location) were so professional in the face of two separate groups of people who were extremely confrontational.  Expectations were clearly stated and signage was prominent, so we were taken aback that these folks were unaware of the policy.

Early bus bird gets the best experience!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The zion canyon shuttle was clean and nice. We sat in the pull-behind car which seemed a little scary at first but the drivers go very slow and are professional. They point out certain points along the way over the intercom, too. Sit on the left side of the bus on the way up the canyon, and the right side on the way back down if you want the best views. BE AWARE: Later in the day as the crowds form, they will allow people to stand and ride in order to fill the bus to maximum capacity. We were thankfully sitting but it was a little uncomfortable to have people standing over us the whole way back down the canyon. If you get there early (we arrived just after 6 am for our first but up to Sinewava) there weren't any crowds and our bus had plenty of room. "

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Watchman Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Moderately Difficult Hike with Wonderful Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"My teenaged son and I hiked the Watchman Trail on our second day at Zion National Park.  The Trail head is a short walk from the visitor center and parking lot.  The hike is moderate in difficulty and is just over 3 miles round trip.  The beginning of the trail is easy, but then it begins to climb.  The elevation gain is moderate at just over 350 feet.  The views along the way are wonderful. and we really enjoyed this trail.  When we got up to top we took the trail extension onto the overlook viewpoint.  There are great views of the nearby mountains and down into the valley of the visitor center and parts of Springdale.  Of course the Watchman mountain in the background is impressive.  We hiked down the circuit and really enjoyed the hike.  If you are in the physical condition for a moderate hike with some elevation gain I recommend the Watchman Trail.  It is very nice."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Watchman Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Mud - Do NOT Try This Trail if Raining,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is listed as an amazing signature hike for Zion and I am sure it is.  I had wanted to see the view of the canyon from here.  Unfortunately, the day we first got to Zion and planned for this hike, it rained and rained hard.  While many places in the desert and in fact Zion have hikes you can do in the rain on rock, the base of this path is silt eroded from the canyon which simply turns to mud.   Anyone going to Zion probably has a less than 2% of this happening to them.  However, if it is raining for your trip pick another hike.  We were convinced to turn back after slogging through the mud only to be met by another hiker who had turned around further up saying it only get worse.  With that said, even a little elevation gives you great views into the canyon.  See the pictures."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Watchman Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Worth the hike!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,I'd give it 5 stars but the trail at this time of the year was exceptionally muddy (red thick mud) for a good portion of the trail. It took our family 3 hours (we parked in the visitor center lot). There are some drop-offs which may cause some anxiety in people with fear of heights but these were only for small portions of the trail. Wear layers as it is all uphill with some stretches that are flat and when the sun was out even in this cool weather we got quite warm. The view at the overlook at the top is worth it.

It will give you a good workout. There are terrific views all around at the end. There's a loop trail at the end that you can take if you choose, which will take about 10-15 minutes. There was a good amount of people on the trail when I went in the early afternoon, but not too many. "
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Watchman Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Always Worth It,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Not the most beautiful hike ever been on, but still great scenery.

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Watchman Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Good Hike for a change of pace,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"On Friday we spent 5 1/2 hours hiking the Narrows, it was fantastic but also made for a very full and tiring day.  On Saturday we were looking for a more relaxed casual day, and the Watchman Trail was perfect for us. It took us 1.5 hours round-trip including the loop at the top.  A little strenuous on the way up but not too bad, and it was a breeze coming back down.  It may not be as majestic or awe-inspiring as the Narrows or Angels Landing, but it’s still a very beautiful hike."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Watchman Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Moderate trail with easy access,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"We chose this trail because we were unable to get parking further into the park and our only option was to start from the Visitor's Center. It was a moderate hike that was pretty easy to complete. We had 3 adults, 3 kids (8, 9, 11 year)s and 2 kids (3, 6 years). The older kids had no trouble. The 6 year old did a bit of complaining, but made it no problem. The 3 year old had to be carried most of the way. Overall, it was a fun hike and a great alternative since the park's other parking lots and shuttle service were closed. You end with a pretty good view of the entrance to Zion, but not much more than what you can see from the ground, so don't get your hopes up for a life-changing finale. We did enjoy the small stream and grotto near the top that cooled off the hike a bit and gave a short change of scenery. "
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Watchman Trail,Hiking Trails,4.5,Accessible ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"While I like the views deeper in the canyon, you can’t beat how close this is to the Watchman Campground. It’s short and climbs some so it will give you a workout but has a nice view at the end looking down on the visitor center and Springdale. I appreciate there’s a loop on top so the trail is not only an out-and-back walk."

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway,Scenic Drives,5.0,worth to take a drive,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"if you have time, this scenic drive is worth to take a look, you drive from the canyon junction to the east, when you pass through the Zion-Mount Carmel tunnel (1.1 miles), you reach the trail head of Canyon overlook trail, you may hike the trail if you have time, otherwise, you can continue to drive the scenic drive to the East end. I also hiked the trail, but you have to find a spot to park your car before you can go hiking. For this scenic drive,  I think the part beyond the trailhead is more attractive, (there is one more tunnel you need to pass through), you can see there are ""wave"" patterns on the orange rock, also has some white rock, I think the scenery here is more beautiful than those along the ""zion canyon scenic drive"", as those mountains/rocks along the ""zion canyon scenic drive"" are more dark, but the rocks here are bright in color, e.g. light orange, white, the pictures taken here is more beautiful especially in a sunny day."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Amazing,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"As our Zion trip ended we chose to take this byway to see different scenery as we headed out. The different coloring and shapes of the rocks were amazing and provided complimentary views to what is seen within the park. There were several other trails that branched off, including the overlook trail, that are well worth the time to hike. We extended our route by heading over State Hwy 14 to Cedar City. I would have skipped that route if I had to do it again, it climbs to 9910 feet elevation and doesn't add much to the visual scene, except for lots of snow when we went in March. "

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway,Scenic Drives,5.0,Stunning.  Beautiful. Majestic. ,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The drive into the canyon and out is amazing. You can see instantly why it is a national park.   When coming from the west be sure to depart early.  There is a very narrow tunnel and if there is an RV they only allow one direction at a time.

It is a separate but lesser visited part of Zion National Park.  It was an easy 5 mile scenic drive with lots of pullouts and trails to magnificent viewpoints. The fall foliage in October was especially stunning.  Make sure you drive all the way to the top, which has a beautiful panoramic views."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Kolob Canyons,Canyons,4.5,not in the main park area,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"you have to enter the Kolob canyon region through another entrance, not in the main park area, no shuttle bus in that region, there is  a 5-mile scenic drive from the entrance to the Timber Creek overlook trailhead. But when we went there in June 2019, there was road construction, and some portion of the road only has one direction of car flow at a time, so you have to wait to drive through. You can see some butte red in color, there is also a Timer Creek trail, but we didn't walk as it was already  7pm when we arrived there, so just take some pictures at the viewpoint and along the drive"

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Kolob Canyons,Canyons,4.5,Spectacular Views,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We'd hiked the southern area of Zion NP but never Kolob Canyons.  It is an easy drive here from St George or Cedar City.  We've stayed in both areas and much prefer St George.  Once we were done with the surly woman behind the desk at the visitor center (she really didn't want to talk to us and really didn't recommend any hiking trails) we were on the newly paved road through this beautiful National Park.  Every turn seemed to reveal a gorgeous view of the canyons.  There were many restrooms in the area and all parking lots were large enough to hold quite a few vehicles.   Highly Recommended!
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Kolob Canyons,Canyons,4.5,Choose Kolob to avoid the Zion crowds,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"This is a great alternative to the very crowded main part of Zion National Park. I recommend the Timber Creek Overlook Trail first and the Taylor Creek trail second. The Timber Creek trail is fairly short but quite scenic at the top. We went in the morning, but it is probably even more beautiful late afternoon. The Taylor Creek trail is longer, with many stream crossings but fewer amazing views. If you can't get shuttle tickets to the main park at Zion, the Kolob Canyons are a good option. Kolob is a 50 minute drive from the main part of Zion. Kudos also to the knowledgeable and friendly park rangers at Kolob."

Make sure you know how to get here as it is not part of the main park & it's entrance is about 45 minutes away.  The day we went they were not taking an entrance fee.  The drive to the end is beautiful with many opportunities to stop & take in the beautiful sites.  We arrived by 8:30am to the Taylor Creek Trail and by the time we had our hiking shoes on there were no more spots left so get there early.  This trail was tiring but worth every step.  It crosses a shallow creek numerous times, goes over rocks, up steps,  through sand, and some shade and sun.  A little bit of everything until the end when you finish at a beautiful alcove and hike back the same way you came.  It took us about 4 hours.  Bring lots of water, snacks and sunscreen for the first section that was in complete sun on our way back."

Fortunately, there's an easy alternative if you are wiling to drive out of the park to East Mesa trail.   It's an easy to moderate 6.7 round-trip hike (easy for teens, doable for energetic elementary aged kids, a bit slower for those with stiff knees).  Mostly flat, very dusty, and quite boring (compared with other Zion hikes) for 3/4 of the route.  only gets a slight grade towards the last section."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Observation Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,"Beware public land has been blocked off as ""private property""",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Beware that the much of the East Rim Trailhead has improperly been blocked off as private property. I compared the survey and the trailhead is clearly in the public land and the last ~1000 feet or so of road is public property off the private property to the south.  The adjacent property owner has blocked it off to limit the trailhead to about 15 cars and blocked off and marked no parking along the road. Based on my reading of publicly available maps and surveys this appears improper. I am sympathetic to owners overrun since the lower access is blocked off from Zion, but the right to barricade off property ends at their property lines approximately 300 feet south from the trailhead. Better to go early because 15 cars fills fast (before 9am in my case). I have no interest in trespassing, but I do feel a right to access our (yes the word is ""our"") public land."

We heard the parking lot at the trailhead filled up from early morning so nearly didn’t bother.  We went on a Monday and arrived about 3pm - there was one car in the parking lot and we passed a couple of people on the way out but had the place to ourselves at the top and we were there half an hour.  It is the best view in the park, possibly in the whole area, if you’ve never been you should take a look."

Good food at the Lodge / had breakfast & lunch there.  Best to arrive as early as possible:  at the crack of dawn, if you can, otherwise parking is a nightmare.   We arrived around 7am, had plenty of parking, then unloaded our rented electric bicycles at the canyon junction for easy & awesome rides at our own pace, stopping whenever & where ever we wanted.   Thereby totally avoiding the shuttle buses which are so irritating (wait times, crazy crowds, sharing germs, & RUDE bus drivers).    Downside:  IF you want to call anyone or share pics while in the canyon:  NO cell service & NO internet service!   Not even at the Lodge!  Even wi-fi calling wasn't working.   So if you have a medical or a family emergency, good luck with communicating that at all  !!   Summary:  Zion is the #2 most popular park in the USA, so avoid it on weekends or on any Holiday, ARRIVE EARLY, & by biking you can avoid the otherwise mandatory shuttle buses !!"

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Observation Point,Points of Interest & Landmarks,5.0,Great hike,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Hiked Observation Point today. We picked up the trail at the East Mesa trailhead. You’ve got to drive past Zion Ponderosa Ranch for about 12 minutes to Fir Rd. There are some big time ruts in the road but if it’s dry you can make it in any car. As you drive up the road you’ll clearly see a large parking area. If you park there add about 1/2 mile to your hike to the trailhead. We pulled up further down Fir Rd and found a spot 50yds from the trailhead. The trail itself was in good shape. The first 2 miles are flat’ish. Then it’s starts to climb and roll a bit. Nothing too strenuous. Plan on 3.5 miles easy. It’s definitely not 3. It took us an hour and fifteen minutes with a few pics breaks along the way.

I am not afraid of heights at all, but this trail was awful if you have edge-phobia. There are no railings with huge drop offs. I had to turn around after I made it up the stairs and to the first flat area. I did Observation Point, overlooking Angel's Landing with no issues, and handled all of the switchbacks at Bryce, but this was tough for me. Parking is crazy, as we got parked in by people waiting for spots. Someone moved the cones from the area next to the handicapped spot so he could park there. Another guy drove the wrong way down the road to try to butt in and get a parking space. The park ranger came out 3 times in the 30 minutes I was waiting for the rest of my party at the trailhead. She even had to call for another ranger to come help her with the people who wouldn't move their cars. Let's just say this was a stressful place for me!  The rest of my family went on the trail and took photos- good view, for sure! They assured me I made the right choice by sitting this one out, though. Just keep in mind that it seems like an easy one (1 mile total- how bad can it be), but it is challenging if you're like me."

We approached from the valley, and read that the trail and parking was located shortly after going through the tunnel.  This was indeed the case, and it was fairly busy, so we needed to drive up the road a short bit to find a parking spot.  There is a restroom near the trailhead.  The hike is a lot of fun.  Plenty of climbing.  There were plenty of icy, wet, and muddy spots on the trail.  We did not hike with traction devices, but we do hike with trekking poles.  That helped.  The good thing about that time of the day is that trail is mostly in the sunshine, so there were plenty of dry sections of the trail.  We did encounter a fair amount of people on the trail, but nothing too bad.  It was a fun hike, and a nice end point view.  We would certainly do this hike again."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion National Park,National Parks,4.5,Overrun with Visitors!,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Zion is undoubtedly beautiful and majestic but there are issues.  The first time we were here several years ago we were evacuated right after we arrived due to the heavy rain that could flood the canyon and huge boulders that fell and blocked the road.  On this second attempt we were unable to get shuttle tickets to go up into the canyon until the day before.  They are restricted due to Covid, released several weeks in advance & sell out almost immediately.  Parking is full within the park by 8-9 am and while there is a lot of parking in Springdale, I think it is expensive at $25 per car.  While waiting for the shuttle within the park, we asked a ranger if admittance to the park was restricted as the shuttle is.  She said no and frankly, this park is overrun with visitors making it difficult to enjoy.  Social distancing did not exist at the shuttle stops (except at the visitor center) as people waited for buses to arrive.  The Riverside walk was filled with people & not a pleasant experience either.  Zion currently has a serious algae problem in their stream (deadly to dogs who drink it) & the ranger told us she would not go in it or allow anyone in her family to do so.  Of course we saw a lot of people with wet clothing from wading in the stream.  There are also myriad electric bikes in the park that cause the shuttles to slow or nearly stop.  I sincerely hope no one is killed or seriously injured before they restrict them to certain areas."

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion National Park,National Parks,4.5,Drive thru on one Road or shuttle the other.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,During Covid they were letting cars go Zion Canyon Scenic Drive as we got there they changed it to Shuttles ONLY ~ while Covid is still present we opted to NOT be on a bus with multiple others.  Plus you have to be one of the first people there in the morning in order to get tickets for that day of travel on the bus .  During this time they are only making half the stops it usually would stop at. So if you feel the same way you can still drive through the National Park by driving from the south entrance and take Mt. Carmel Highway to the East.  You can still get good sense of the beauty that ZION has to offer.
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion National Park,National Parks,4.5,A Different way to Experience Zion (If you can't get in),5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The main thing to know about Zion is that cars are NOT allowed on the park's ""scenic drive"". The only way to enjoy the drive and the nearby hiking trails are to use the shuttle busses . . . and herein lies the problem:  The park operates shuttle busses that cost $1 per person, but the tickets sell out QUICKLY. Combined with social distancing requirements of COVID, getting tickets is almost impossible unless you get them WAY ahead of time. There are PRIVATELY run shuttle busses, but they are a rip off. You'll pay anywhere from $35 to $60 per person to get the exact same ride as the $1 shuttle.  But fear not. You can have an excellent experience at Zion, without the benefit of shuttle busses. First, you can drive the Kolob Terrace Rd. from Virgin, UT. This will take you through the western part of Zion, and provides magnificent scenery. There are a few hiking trails along the way, but they are not heavily trafficked. Prepare accordingly. The second option is to drive highway 9 (also known as the Zion - Mount Carmel Highway) which takes you through the eastern side of Zion. The views are breathtaking. We did both Kolob Terrace and Highway 9 and were NOT disappointed. If you cannot get into the ""touristy"" part of Zion, this is the way to go."

Our only regret is not bringing our bikes, but hey it’s a reason to come back! The park is open 24 hours and we even took the night drive to see the stars. We will definitely try the camp grounds next time. We were so fortunate to come up close to big horn sheep and to be able to catch the shuttle on the first day! This park really takes your breath away. It was genuinely a sad moment to have to depart such a captivating natural place, but as I’ve said we will definitely return to explore even more. For those reading and contemplating the distance from where ever you are to visit Zion, trust me the drive and time will be very worth while. Even if petrol was $10 per gallon, I’d still gladly drive the hundreds of miles to come here, it really is that fantastic."

Got to the trailhead abound 10:00 a.m. and finished back down around 4:00 p.m. We did stop and take a lot of pictures, but since it's winter and the ground is covered in snow, you can expect everyone will be taking it slower.

Since Angels Landing chained part is closed, we continued up the trail past scouts lookout for another peak- it was beautiful and there was probably only 4 other people up there! We even saw a condor. Most of the hike is paved so you don’t need hiking shoes. Nikes or tennis shoes will do! Hike was strenuous half of the time during the ascent, lots of switch backs, but doable. Not crowded on the ascent, but definitely passed lots of people coming up during our descent around 9:15a. It was starting to get hot during our decent and we got to the bottom at 10:10a.

Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Canyon Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Ridiculous Shuttle System,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Let me start by stating this is not a negative review about Zion NP itself!  We all know how stunningly beautiful Zion is.  My problem is with the shuttle system.  It is basically IMPOSSIBLE to get shuttle tickets on the Parks App, which is the only place that sells them. I logged on at exactly 9am on the day prior but all tickets were already sold out. So basically I booked a hotel (expensive!) in Springdale to be close to the Zion Canyon Drive but couldn't get on a darn shuttle in order to see it.  They charge a $35 entrance fee at the East entrance knowing full well you most likely have no shot at seeing the best part of the park, which irks me. The only other options are walking or renting a bike, which is kind of hard to do with heavy camera gear in tow.  As beautiful as Zion is, it's sort of like Disneyland.  My advice is to head to Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon and Grand Staircase. Just as stunning scenery with no B.S. and no crowds."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Canyon Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Do it when the shuttles are running!,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The shuttles run for most of the year except end of Nov/Dec into some of Jan. If you simply ride the shuttle you can sit back and relax and enjoy the magnificent views around you. The line for the shuttle can get ridiculous in the summer, worth going during off seasons to save time. The entire shuttle ride is still about 1h15/1h30."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Canyon Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Beautiful when you can see it!,4.0 of 5 bubbles,During the shuttle season it’s hard to get the full effect as the shuttles obstruct your view while inside. The best way would be to bike the road. A lot of people were doing that. 
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Canyon Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Exploring the park,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The rock formations stand large, strong and command presence. So very unique in the layers of colors and movement of lines. The 1.1 mile tunnel built in the 1930s is quite impressive. 2 driving lanes bored straight through this very hard solid rock. Incredible engineering in the 30s. Many pull outs to view sites and hike the trails. Beautiful day."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Canyon Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Scenic is the Keyword,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"The Scenic Drive is viewed from the shuttle buses which are based at the information center and are mandatory most of the year to avoid congestion on the roads and the limited parking areas.  They travel very regularly, and so you can be dropped off at one trailhead and be picked up at the end of the trail.  You can get a good overall feel for the park from the shuttle without exerting yourself if there are physical limitations.  At the Zion Lodge we heard coyote pups learning to howl."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Canyon Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Words Can't Adequality Describe This,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Breathtaking drive!  Pictures just don't do this justice!  During most months, this drive is a straight shot through the southern end of Zion from gate to gate.  You can go north to trolly stop 3.  However, it's closed to cars from  3-9 during most of the year.  as such, this path is the only real way to drive 'though' Zion. The lighting changes depending upon the weather and time of day.  Don't miss diving through during the 'golden hours' near sunset when the light bounces off all of the landscape."
Zion National Park,Utah (UT),Zion Canyon Scenic Drive,Scenic Drives,5.0,Beautiful Drive,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Spectacular scenery all along the route. Plenty of pull outs to get out and get some great photos like at Courtyard of the Patriarchs or Great White Throne. However, you really should park the car and do some hikes  whether it's the awe inspiring but strenuous climb to the top of Angel's Landing or the easier Riverside Walk or Emerald Pools Trail to fully appreciate this beautiful National Park. During the off-season from November through February when shuttles are not running, I was able to drive my car along the road. However keep in mind that rangers may close the road at any time to prevent traffic from overwhelming the park as happened on Friday Feb 26."

We drove through the south end of Zion three years ago and it was just a tease of Zion's beauty.  We came back this year to take the whole park in and stayed in the Zion Lodge and enjoyed all the trails.

This is beautiful and you may also see goats and deer. Be careful not to hit people being dumb or the animals.
