       "\"I have hiked to the fire tower a few times. Its a great hike, and not too strenuous elevation gains.  If the NO rangers are up there ( in the summer) they used to allow you to go up the tower. We had to turn back on 3/20 because of hard pack solid ice. We had our Katoohla micro spikes on, and solid hiking poles, and knew they simply  wouldn't be enough if the ice was on the steeper sections.  We walked into the trailhead because the access road gate is still closed. After deciding to cross the lot and hike Beech Cliff Loop, which was much more clear of ice, and has excellent views of Echo Lake and the ocean out toward  Southwest Harbor. We returned to BH to hear of the recovery of a young couple from Rutland Massachusetts  who had fallen 100 feet to their death on Dorr Mountain Gorge Trail. The tragedy attributed to ice on the trails. Anyone not experienced with full crampon travel, and ice climbing training should never attempt to hike or climb on solid ice. The danger is severe.. \""

       "\"I have hiked to the fire tower a few times. Its a great hike, and not too strenuous elevation gains.  If the NO rangers are up there ( in the summer) they used to allow you to go up the tower. We had to turn back on 3/20 because of hard pack solid ice. We had our Katoohla micro spikes on, and solid hiking poles, and knew they simply  wouldn't be enough if the ice was on the steeper sections.  We walked into the trailhead because the access road gate is still closed. After deciding to cross the lot and hike Beech Cliff Loop, which was much more clear of ice, and has excellent views of Echo Lake and the ocean out toward  Southwest Harbor. We returned to BH to hear of the recovery of a young couple from Rutland Massachusetts  who had fallen 100 feet to their death on Dorr Mountain Gorge Trail. The tragedy attributed to ice on the trails. Anyone not experienced with full crampon travel, and ice climbing training should never attempt to hike or climb on solid ice. The danger is severe.. \""

       "'We were staying with family in Sun City (near the Phoenix airport) and drove in our rental vehicle the approximate 3.5 hour drive to the south entrance of the Grand Canyon.  The park entrance was easy to find.  Parking this year was $35/vehicle.  I was skeptical going in, as several friends had this excursion on their \"bucket list\" while others simply raved.  I worried I would be disappointed.  However, the views absolutely spectacular!  We self-guided/toured.  We both experienced some vertigo and were careful to hang on to the railings provided, or sit on available benches as needed. Also bring water.  With the high elevation, it is easier to get winded, and water helps. We did have a hiker in front of us fall a few times from experiencing vertigo,and with assistance from others were able to help him get off the stairs and onto level ground to sit down.  He was embarrassed but grateful.  It could (and does) happen to anyone.  There were some areas that were roped off due to ice and snow and I was amazed how many people stupidly ignored the warnings and bypassed the barriers to get closer to the edge of the Canyon for selfies!   Check the weather in advance and dress appropriately.  The temperature was 30 degrees cooler in the Canyon than in the Phoenix area.  There were many families present and some pushing young ones in strollers.  On Feb 10, it was a chilly, windy, 40 degrees F.   There are lots of signs at various points educating you on the history of rocks, the Colorado river running through the Canyon, etc., and a small museum you can enter about 1.5 hours into the walk.  After our hike, we were exhausted and wind blown, and caught a shuttle back to the parking lot.  Kudos to those who can manage to walk the entire thing.  We didn\\'t see everything the south side had to offer.  In our vehicle, we exited the park from the east side and for some 50+ miles, still saw the Grand Canyon from out the driver\\'s side window. There were several spots along the way to stop and take more photos.  All in all, it was a physically and mentally stimulating journey that I highly recommend.'"

The path is completely paved, which allows for parents to push strollers and those in wheelchairs or handicapped scooters to roll instead of walk â€“ at least in theory. We passed one couple halfway, torn between continuing to the lookout tower and turning around out of fear that their scooter battery might fail on route. Iâ€™m not sure how much elevation was gained from the parking lot to the actual summit, but it was rather significant, and the steep walk felt to be in excess of a mile. On the way, there were several vista points that provided ample opportunity for selfies and panoramic shots.'"

       "'We were looking for a great day hike in or near the North Cascades National park in Washington state and found Maple Loop Trail on Tripadvisor and several other online travel forums. The 7.1 miles round trip did not sound challenging but we had to think twice about the elevation - up and down 2000 feet in those 7 miles. We checked with the lodge receptionist who encouraged us to go saying she has done the trail not too long ago and she was retirement age. The hike started from Rainy Lake area parking lot and we decided to go anti-clockwise (following the signs) so that we would go up more gradually and handle the steeper part on the way back. The incline was not bad and we soon started admiring wonderful views of the surrounding mountains. After going a bit further, we saw wonderful views of Lake Ann that we kept seeing repeatedly throughout the hike. After passing the Heather Meadows, a wonderful view of surrounding mountain ranges opened up and we could see a lot of colored bushes and trees and chipmunks running around. We hiked further up to Maple Pass (elevation 7000 ft) and were able to admire Frisco Mountain up close. Another view to a valley a bit further away opened up before the trail turned back and we started descending to the valley. Huckleberries along the way and beautiful glimpses of Rainy Lake made the descent fun despite the more challenging terrain. We were really excited about all the wonderful views that we could admire on this hike. Even thought it might be challenging for couch potatoes, everyone can do it if they take their time and it is one of the most beautiful mountain hikes in Washington.'"

White sand beaches with turquoise waters, and best of all, no one is there! We originally went to see Lobo Canyon, but the timing for the day trip is not long enough (it is nine miles round trip). We had to pivot, and instead walked along a ~2 mile beach strip, which was entrancing. The island is truly special. We were then treated to an unexpected treat on the ferry home, and stopped for a quick photo shoot at the Painted Cave. Truly special day, and I would highly recommend it!'"
